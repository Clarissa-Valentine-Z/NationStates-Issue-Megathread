[b][anchor=1460]#1460[/anchor]: A Burning Question [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Burpbarry, a well-known @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ luxury outerwear brand, has declared that they have incinerated 15 million bits worth of stockpiled surplus clothing.

The Debate
1. "I can't believe these people set fire to a heap of perfectly serviceable clothing, while I don't even have a plain shirt to wear," wails @@RANDOMNAME@@, the beggar who often hangs out in front of your residence, clasping the newspaper around @@HIS/HER@@ shoulders more firmly. "This is such an atrocious waste of resources. Manufacturers should be made to donate their surplus goods to charity for unfortunate folks like me, not destroy them!"

2. "Hogwash! You won't listen to this deranged woman, will you?" asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, the CEO of Burpbarry, looking flabbergasted. "Don't forget that we are a luxury brand, and exclusivity is maintained by controlling the supply side of the equation. What distinction would wearing a Burpbarry outfit confer on you, if any old scrounger could get the same things from a donation bin? Market freedom means being allowed to protect our brand value, and to dispose of our own property as we see fit."

3. "Frankly, your disposal method is disgusting!" fumes @@RANDOMNAME@@, an environmentalist and DIY enthusiast, sporting a hat made of a recycled yogurt tub. "If companies want to get rid of their surplus without diluting their brand, why not upcycle inventively? For a start, I think those fancy Burpbarry scarves could be braided into a reusable canvas bag. Perchance you should seize the end-of-season surplus, and employ skilled weavers to turn them into something new."

The Issue
In a recent local election, homeless person @@RANDOMNAME_1@@ was denied the right to vote because @@HE/SHE@@ did not have any identification. @@HIS/HER_1@@ plea to vote went viral after a crowd of journalists, who were coincidentally at the polling place to report on a story about a prominent politician allegedly kissing babies, recorded the rant.

The Debate
1. "All I wanted to do was vote," sobs @@RANDOMNAME_1@@, in hysterics as the media scrum surges forward, hanging on to every word @@HE/SHE_1@@ says. "How does it feel to disenfranchise the poor, @@LEADER@@? You know we don't have the time or money to get an ID while we're trying to stay off the streets. Let us vote, no questions asked!"

2. "What a waste of time," says political pundit @@RANDOMNAME@@, rolling @@HIS/HER@@ eyes while she speaks over an unflattering still of @@RANDOMNAME_1@@ showing @@HIM/HER_1@@ ejecting spittle midspeech. "Politically engaged voters will gladly make an effort to present identification when voting. It's a small price to pay to protect ourselves from the wrong people being elected! In fact, if we wanted elections to be more secure, election officials should check IDs more carefully in those crime-infested areas."

4. "I'm astounded that this is still an issue," says @@RANDOMNAME@@, clutching a scrapbook filled with photos of you. "You're the best option we've got, never mind the voters! Abolish all elections, and give yourself the perpetual right to the highest office - a dictatorship is all we deserve."

The Issue
@@REGION@@ gave cheer last night after infamous terrorist leader @@RANDOMNAME@@ was assassinated in a surprise raid by the elite @@ANIMAL@@ Team 5. However, jubilation quickly turned to controversy when one of the soldiers claimed personal responsibility for the assassination, forgoing the unit's traditional "code of silence".

The Debate
1. "What can I say? It's just the doggone plain truth!" bellows Sergeant @@RANDOMNAME_1@@, the offending soldier in question, as @@HE/SHE_1@@ props @@HIS/HER_1@@ boots on your desk. "You can see it all on the body cam footage, so it's not like anyone can say I'm lyin'. Already got some United Federation suits looking to make a movie, some dork wants to write my biography, the VIP party invites are rolling in — I earned all of this. Y'all can't take that away cause some limp-wrists say it's 'disrespectful' or 'attention hogging'. Besides, it's good for @@NAME@@ too! Once my story becomes a blockbuster, nobody's going to question our military might. So how about you just give me a medal for a job well done?"

2. "Etiquette exists for a reason, @@LEADER@@," retorts General @@RANDOMNAME@@ as @@HE/SHE@@ readjusts your lapel pin. "Even though Sergeant @@RANDOMLASTNAME_1@@ took the final shot, that mission was a team effort. When you start snubbing that core belief, you end up making soldiers of fortune, not members of the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ armed forces. Oh sure, it's all fun and parties today. But then they start disobeying orders, thinking they know best. Then they start going rogue. Next thing you know, Blackacre slips some @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ under the table, and our whole army is goose-stepping down @@CAPITAL@@ to a different tune! We should discharge @@RANDOMLASTNAME_1@@ for unmilitary-like conduct and stand firm behind our behavior policies."

3. "Ah, nuts to that, General Buzzkill!" proclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, another @@ANIMAL@@ Team 5 operative whose tinted glasses and long hair certainly violate some dress code. "@@RANDOMLASTNAME_1@@ has it right! Your problem is trying to make the army all secretive and mysterious. It's just another job, dude! No one tells my old man how to sell stuffed animals at the mall. He just, like, does it. We need to be more like that. Dump all of these creepy creeds and regulations! Let troops say what we want to say, to whoever we want. Everything will work itself out."

[b][anchor=1463]#1463[/anchor]: Sandbagging [Baggieland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A small island has vanished into the sea, farmland was flooded when a river burst its banks, and whole villages have been near-submerged by rising waters. The reason for these floods? Sand mining: billions of tonnes of sand and gravel extracted from rivers, lakes and coastlines.

The Debate
1. “We can’t stop the modernisation of @@NAME@@,” states Matthew Mountsermon, your Minister of Residential Construction on Aggregates. “These materials are the literal foundation of our economy! If you want buildings and infrastructure, you need sand! Glass, computer chips... sand! Did you know it takes 30,000 tonnes of sand to build just one kilometre of a motorway? Avoiding flooding just takes a little planning, and maybe some concrete barriers. Nothing should hinder the development of @@NAME@@!”

2. “Our addiction to sand is staggering,” declares Preeti Summers, your Environment Minister, as she tries to prove how easy it is to reuse everyday objects by cleaning her fingernails with a paper clip. “At first they extracted it from quarries, but when those ran out, they took sand from beaches, then islands, now they’re dredging the seabed. The construction industry needs to be stopped in its tracks. Who needs that much concrete anyway?”

3. “I’ve got an alternative,” muses passing manual labourer Yulha Campbell, hefting a heavy iron mallet. “Need more sand and gravel? We can make it. Just smash up rocks from hills and mountains. Bash ‘em into pieces! Hammers! Bombs! Giant stompy robots! Wheeeee!” He demonstrates by smashing a marble bust of your predecessor.

4. “You know where there’s a lot of sand? The desert!” exclaims Damien Holst, one of your science advisers, as he stretches some kind of Day-Glo gunk. “True, desert sand is too fine and we haven’t found a way to bond it together yet, but I’m sure if we give it a go, and give it lots of determination and government funding... Yes, we’ll find a way!”

[b][anchor=1464]#1464[/anchor]: Gentry Genes Getting Grim [Ostrov Svobody; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Duke Geoffrey Bannister, a 13-year-old scion visiting from the ancient nation of Maxtopia, is an absolute oik who seems to lack impulse control and empathy, and is known to have terrorized his own fiefdom with no regard for human life. Many blame his odious personality (and his distinctive jutting "Maxburg chin") on generations of interbreeding. A council of @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ nobles has been convened to discuss how this sort of outcome can be avoided amongst your own nation's nobility.

The Debate
1. "The things we do for love," complains @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ noble James Bannister, who is an indeterminate relative of the young duke, and has just returned from an arduous and prolonged trek to drop the young horror back home. "My uh... 'nephew' is a special case. But you can't always blame genes! I mean, his mother is a fine figure of a woman. A fine, fine figure. There have always been occasional bad eggs, but breeding true has benefits too. We have to think about our dynastic security and continuation of stable government! If anything, we ought to be quashing this seditious talk about inbreeding and bad genes, and instead require that noble blood is never diluted with the common classes. We are their social betters!"

2. "I love my dearest @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@; we'd play together at Uncle's estate when we were growing up, and that gives us a bond beyond our blood," chuffs Lord @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, his dangling jeweled chains hypnotically bouncing off of his pendulous gut. "But maybe we could keep the gene pool diverse and playtime interesting by adding two — or ten — consorts from the middle classes into the mix, and legitimising the bastard offspring by default. Healthy children, and more fun for everyone! Come to papa!"

3. "Widening the gene pool is sensible, but we can maintain some decorum while doing so, and perhaps also accrue some political advantage," muses noble matriarch Helena Tyrone, smiling slyly at you. "I wonder if perhaps a small group of powerbrokers, led by yourself, could arrange matches between our nation's nobles and suitable men and women of power from across the world. Young folk should offer love to and breed with who we tell them to, don't you think, my dear?"

4. "Know what the problem is?" asks General @@RANDOMNAME@@, immediately answering @@HIS/HER@@ own question before you can reply. "These loons being empowered at all. We all know that real power isn't blood, or genes, or nobility. Real power comes from force of arms, and command of armies. So, let's just get rid of this aristocracy nonsense, and centralize YOUR power. Long live @@LEADER@@! Long live @@NAME@@!"

[b][anchor=1465]#1465[/anchor]: Parking Pandemonium [Authoritaria-Imperia; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
A mall in Kyiv recently introduced women’s parking spaces that feature extra width and better safety through improved lighting. Celebrity podcaster and influencer Schmoe Logan recently had his car towed for using one of these spaces, and is bringing the spots into the spotlight.

The Debate
1. “These gendered parking spaces are discriminatory and they must be banned,” says Logan in his podcast, always seemingly a few words away from being dropped by his sponsors. “There were no places left! What was I meant to do? It’s not like parking lots are dangerous places. Man, this incident really makes you think about sexism. Anyways, this week’s show is brought to you by the Jock Club, where for a few rubles a month, you will receive a curated selection of underwear...”

2. “This mall’s initiative is simply giving a traditionally masculine space a woman’s touch,” interjects Minister of Safety Birgitta Serling, while she turns off the podcast and starts capping all of your pointiest pens. “In fact, we should roll out a nationwide quota of non-masculine parking spaces. It will make it so much easier to park and will do wonders for assault rates! By bringing them down, I mean...”

3. “If you ask me, these solutions won’t fix the greater cultural problem — the lack of safety,” offers a passing therapist, showing you an inkblot that looks like a parking space. “If you fund more night-time patrols and pay for security cameras in all parking lots, fewer people will be anxious. And, if people are worried about being watched constantly, I’m sure they can get professional help. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to go; your two minute consultation is up. Any more and I’d have to charge you.”

4. “SILENCE!” booms His Wisdom N. Sanni Teeh, Grand Kahuna of the Cult of Cyan, who has been pushing the little-known religious organisation to rename itself ‘Cyantology’. “‘Tis a great insult to our deity to waste time needlessly looking for parking spots instead of praying! The Maker demands our malls use...” he gazes up at the ceiling, “...free valet parking.”

[b][anchor=1466]#1466[/anchor]: Don’t Shoot Your Eye Out [Socialist Macronesia; ed: Candensia][/b]

The Issue
A series of accidental shootings and catastrophic malfunctions has triggered debate surrounding the safety and reliability of civilian firearms.

The Debate
1. “I bought a pistol, not a grenade!” shouts former military officer Robin Kumar, her arm suspended in a sling. “I was mugged yesterday, but when I tried to defend myself, my handgun exploded and almost killed me! This cannot continue! All firearm companies must prioritize weapon safety and rigorously test their products to prove they are reliable.”

2. “This reveals an underlying problem: our firearms need an update,” explains corporate futurist Adele Rubio, polishing her toy ray-gun. “Malanasia ought to innovate and overhaul civilian weapons with emerging tech like biometrics, recoil-dampening composites, and interwoven electronics. The resulting smart guns would limit accidents while also improving safety. Just shoot a grant or two at gun-makers to cover the cost of R&D.”

3. “Safer guns are pointless if the average shooter can’t clean a barrel,” asserts firearms instructor Diego City. “Malanese guns are notoriously unreliable, but their frequent malfunctions can be minimized with proper upkeep. All gun owners should be required to complete a training course in weapons maintenance. Maybe then I won’t get dirty looks when asking clients if they’re stripping.”

4. “Y’all betta not be tryna mess with my guns,” says Jill Fox, wielding a rusted, homemade shotgun. “Malanese guns work just fine, and we don’t need no safety courses or fancy microchips! All those accidents is just weedin’ out the butt-brains!” She fires her weapon into the air, and the barrel shatters.

[b][anchor=1467]#1467[/anchor]: Gay Men Held by Police [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
@@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ tourists @@RANDOMMALENAME_1@@ and @@RANDOMMALENAME_2@@ were recently on a romantic city break in the capital of Sacerdia, and like many other couples made a point of kissing by moonlight on the world-famous Lovers' Bridge. Unfortunately for them, homosexuality is a crime in Sacerdia, and they were arrested.

The Debate
1. "@@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@ and @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@@@ perhaps could have been more circumspect, but they're @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ citizens who have committed no crime under our laws," observes @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Consulate Officer Paul Myfinger. "We have a moral obligation to negotiate their release. I suggest we could make a couple of trade concessions, favouring Sacerdian woolen goods with selective tariffs on competitor nations, for example. In return, our out-of-the-closet citizens can be gotten out of hot water. I'm also confident we can establish procedures to send home any future @@DEMONYMNOUNPLURAL@@ arrested there. Everybody wins."

2. Reverend Indy Nile is both a priest and a general in the Sacerdian Holy Army, and he has a counter-proposal. "Gayness is against the will of the Lord our God. We will give you back these transgressors, but you must recognise the holy truth that homosexuality is a grave sin. Ban batty-boy loving in @@NAME@@, and we'll extradite these criminals to your jurisdiction. Let us move forward together, in faith." He gazes up adoringly at a semi-naked statuary depiction of his deity.

3. "We have to be balanced about this, I'm afraid," offers Foreign Office diplomat Hyde Yorlove. "Out of respect for judicial sovereignty we must leave the couple to the mercy of the Sacerdian justice system. To stop this happening again, maybe we can set up a bureau to issue guidance and travel advice for gay holiday-makers."

4. "RAAAAAAAAAARGH!" bellows perpetually angry gay activist Neil Foreman, tipping your desk over in a rage. "I am Gay Man! Hear me roar! My leader, we cannot negotiate with filthy homophobes and bigoted scum! Send the army in, and rescue my proud brethren, then bomb Sacerdia till they agree to repeal their homophobic laws. We'll give these blighters cold hard steel... cause they don't like it up 'em, you know!"

[b][anchor=1468]#1468[/anchor]: Meat With Approval [Sedgistan; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The nation's strict animal welfare regulations for slaughter are up for debate, as the Order of Violet lobbies for an exemption to allow ritualistic slaughter.

The Debate
1. "According to the Book of Violet, the Prophet Max, Chapter VII, 'Ye shall taketh thine animal and, reciting the Oath to Violet's Dread Divinity, ye shall inserteth a red-hot poker up yonder...' well, you can guess the rest," chuckles eccentric subdeacon Clement Garza. "Currently, our followers have to import their meat — at great expense — from more tolerant countries, or they're stuck eating vegetables. Do you know what Violet has to say about the preparation of asparagus?" He winces for dramatic effect. "Grant us an exemption to these discriminatory laws, and allow us to slaughter animals as the almighty Violet demanded."

2. "It's obvious how that one will end up," growls Indira Meier of the Hackett & Beatty Abattoir, gazing longingly at a room full of blunt instruments, chainsaws, and a particularly large stick with a rusty nail in it. "Restaurant buyers will just ask for Violetist-certified meat anyway, as they can serve that to anyone. Meanwhile, your average Joe Kill-Cow is stuck stunning and whatnot, and struggling to make a living. Rather than one-off exemptions for Violetists, trust butchers. Then we can remain competitive by finding cost-effective ways to operate and everyone will be happy. Well, except the animal-friendly lot, but they're too protein-deficient to make much of a fuss." She points a stun gun at a cow. "Daisy, I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse."

3. Miles Stewart, proponent of the 'Killing Through Kindness' method adopted by precisely zero abattoirs since last year's book tour, coughs quietly. "One life is worth as much as any other, and animals deserve to go in the same way we'd want to: in our own beds, surrounded by our loving family, with peaceful sitar music playing and incense sticks burning."
