[b][anchor=0]#0[/anchor]: Should Democracy Be Compulsory?[/b]

The Issue
In response to a slow news week, certain highbrow newspapers have stirred up the debate over voluntary vs compulsory voting.

The Debate
1. "Compulsory voting makes about as much sense as having the death penalty for attempted suicide," says civil rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You can't force people to be free! You can only give them the choice. Besides, if all those derelicts who can't be bothered to get off their butts once every few years voted, who would they elect? I shudder to think."

2. "It's not contradictory at all," argues political commentator @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The fact is, if not everyone votes, the outcome isn't truly representative. Some groups--like elderly gun nuts--vote more often than others. That's why we always end up with such terrible politicians."

3. "This raises an interesting issue," says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your brother. "And that is: why do we need elections, anyway? Seems to me it would be much simpler if you just decided what was right, and did it. Wouldn't that save everyone a lot of time?"

The Issue
Last night the respected tabloid TV show "[i]60 Minutes[/i]" ran a report on @@NAME@@'s rising divorce rate. What is happening to the nuclear family?

The Debate
*1. "There's a simple solution," says Pastor Felix, of the Catholic Church. "Divorce should be illegal. 'For better or worse,' anyone remember how that goes? We should return to the good old days, when you got married for life and stuck by your partner no matter how much of a drunken, abusive, adulterating disappointment they turned out to be."

*2. "There's a simple solution," says John Felix, of the Family Values Coalition. "Divorce should be illegal. 'For better or worse,' anyone remember how that goes?

[[color=purple]Must not allow religion[/color] / [color=purple]Must have Atheism[/color]]

3. John Black, author of the hit book, 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Some Whole Other Place,' has a simpler solution. "If couples would just call each other 'darling' once in a while, there would be far fewer relationship breakdowns. A little affection is all it takes. So the government should make it mandatory: call your spouse 'darling' at least once a day, or face a fine."

**4. "There's a simple way to boost the marriage rate," says gay rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Abolish those archaic laws that discriminate against same-sex marriages. It's obscene to treat people differently because of their sexual preference. Besides, everyone knows gay relationships are more stable than straight ones." [[color=red]Homosexual marriage is illegal[/color]] 

**5. "There's a simple way to boost the marriage rate," says gay rights activist Frank Weber. "Abolish those archaic laws that discriminate against same-sex marriages. It's obscene to treat people differently because of their sexual orientation. Besides, everyone knows gay relationships are more stable than straight ones." [Policy TBD]

The Issue
Several major city streets were clogged with bicycles this morning, as the environmental group 'Two Wheels Good, Four Wheels Bad' staged a protest. Several hundred riders ambled through downtown streets, blissfully ignoring the torrent of abuse hurled at them by thousands of motorists running late for work.

The Debate
1. "People are sick of dirty, smelly automobiles," says protest organizer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "They're choking the city, the environment--our lives! Cars must be banned!"

2. "The only thing people are sick of is long-haired idiots riding their bicycles at two miles an hour on major thoroughfares," says committed motorist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "People shouldn't be able to protest like this. The government needs to crack down on them."

3. The Automotive Manufacturers Association, meanwhile, has called for government support. "It's clear that we need to boost the level of automobile support in this country. This protest this morning is a clear indication of... um... anyway, we need more government funds."

The Issue
Children as young as eight have been spotted gambling in some of @@NAME@@'s seedier casinos.

The Debate
1. Social activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ is outraged. "Gambling needs to be outlawed immediately. It's no wonder children are becoming sucked into the vice, with adults setting such a poor example. Gambling is a stain on @@NAME@@'s international reputation and it must be stopped!"

2. However, Crown Casino chairperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@ says, "What's wrong with children gambling? It prepares them for the realities of life, teaching them that success or failure is not due to hard work or intelligence, but the roll of the dice. Besides, if kids weren't gambling, they'd be spraypainting trains."

It's time for the government to hire a new religious advisor. Your people have narrowed down the candidates to:

The Debate
1. Staunch traditionalist religious leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@: boasts an excellent track record, having rapidly increased religious service attendances in @@HIS@@ constituencies through the "Reaching God Through Guilt" program. Seen as a solid choice.

2. New Age thinker @@RANDOM_NAME@@: a left-field candidate with some radical ideas. "For me, it's not about the name of your religion. It's about discovering your spirituality in whatever guise that takes. Some people call that a cult: I call it taking spirituality to the people."

[b][anchor=7]#7[/anchor]: Animal Liberation Front Strikes Again[/b]

The Issue
The increasingly militant Animal Liberation Front struck again last night, freeing dozens of chickens bound for delicious snack packs.

The Debate
1. "These nuts have got to be stopped," demands concerned consumer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "They need to face the fact people want snack packs, no matter how many innocent chickens must be sacrificed. Besides, chickens would do the same to us if they had the chance."

2. "These Liberationists are highlighting an important issue," pleads @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Too often, animals are put through needless cruelty, just to make their flesh taste a little more deliciously succulent. I'm sure we could ban the more horrific abuses without putting too much of a dent in our national obesity figures. Couldn't we?"

3. "Animals have feelings too!" yelled protestor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, before being set upon by hungry passers-by. "Free the animals! Ban meat-eating!"

4. Economist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ has an alternative. "You don't need to take away the people's right to choose. You just need to build the costs of animal suffering into the price. A tax on meat-eating, in proportion to the amount of cruelty involved, would do the trick. Plus think of the benefit for the national coffers! Of course, poor people wouldn't be able to afford meat, but that's just more incentive for them to get jobs."

The Issue
A loose coalition of sartorially-challenged individuals known as "Let It All Hang Out" has called on the government to relax public nudity laws.

The Debate
1. "For too long, our bodies have been trapped in these prisons of cotton and polyester!" yelled protester @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while apparently developing a nasty case of sunburn. "We must repeal the puritanical laws that make public nudity a crime. My body--my choice to dangle!"

2. "I agree," mused sociology professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "But I don't think the protestors are going far enough. Public nudity shouldn't be an option: it should be compulsory. Nudity is highly liberating. And it would put that disgusting "Hooters" out of business once and for all."

3. "Whoa, whoa," says noted accountant @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Are these people serious? The last thing I want to see when I'm out for a coffee is some lumbering, over-weight nudist coming down the sidewalk toward me. If people want to get naked, they can do it in the privacy of their own homes. Think of the children!"

The Issue
In a bid to provide a new revenue stream for @@NAME@@'s Beef-Based Agriculture industry, it has been suggested that @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ could be added to the menu.

The Debate
1. "The fact is, the @@ANIMAL@@ population is out of control," says Beef-Based Agriculture spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We have to do something about them anyway, so why not market them as tasty snacks? We could have @@ANIMAL@@ kebabs, @@ANIMAL@@ pies, @@ANIMAL@@-on-a-sticks--the possibilities are endless!

[b][anchor=10]#10[/anchor]: Social Inequality Reaching Embarrassing Levels[/b]

The Issue
Commentators have warned that @@NAME@@'s social inequalities threaten to make it an international pariah.

The Debate
1. "Look, I don't like it either," said Chamber of Commerce spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Just on the way here, I had to step over three homeless people, and one of my shoes got caught on a beggar. But inequality is the price we pay for economic strength. If anything, we need fewer taxes, so those of us who are well-off can afford to be more generous. If we want to, that is."

2. "I think we've forgotten what economic strength is all about," says social worker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The economy is meant to be a means to a high standard of living, not an end in itself. It's become an excuse for the rich to prosper while the poor fall through the cracks. Not everyone is poor because they don't feel like working. We must provide more welfare."

3. "Who says we're an international pariah?" demands military honcho @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What are their names? If that's the way the international community feels, we obviously need to prepare for war."

While effusively praising @@NAME@@'s leadership and bowing repeatedly, a delegation has humbly requested that the government take a more "modernistic" view in the future.

The Debate
1. The High Minister for Finance, who also happens to be your brother, dismisses the claim. "What these people fail to realize is that you know what's best for them. The alternative is anarchy! I say stick to your course. And execute these wackos for treason."

2. "Perhaps the people could be given some more political freedoms," muses your Chief of Staff, who is your sister. "Is there really such harm in allowing public discussion of ideas? We could even have a real Opposition Party. One that isn't just full of your puppets, I mean."

Following a tragic double-murder, capital punishment has surged as an election issue. There now appears a real possibility that right-wing candidate @@RANDOM_NAME@@, running on a "Do the Crime, pay the Penalty" platform, will gain power. While society's intelligentsia is outraged, debate rages as to whether the government should intervene.

The Debate
1. "This is a democracy, remember?" rhetorically questions Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the University of Greater @@NAME@@. "That means that if the people want something, the people get it. I hate to say it, but in the name of political freedom, we need to accept that our country will have the death penalty."

2. "I'm sorry," says Civil Rights Unionist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "but this travesty cannot be allowed to pass. If the government needs to crack down on lunatic fringe groups in order to keep our great nation free of the death penalty, then so be it. We must ban the politics of hatred and fear!"

2. "We need more free speech, not less," argues civil rights campaigner @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Free speech allows ideas to be explored, challenged, and discussed in a productive, open forum. It teaches our kids to be critical thinkers. And dirty words, of course, but that's just the price you pay."

[3]. "The right to free speech is a central tenet of our system of democracy," says religious leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@.

2. "The solution to crime is not more police!" says noted sociologist and occasional crime novelist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Studies repeatedly show that crime is caused by poverty and poor education. Increase government spending in these areas, and crime will fall! Maybe not overnight, but it will happen."

3. "Yeah, good luck with that," says conservative leader and gun enthusiast @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Look, we do need more police, that's clear. But that's not enough. We need real punishments: sentences that will act as a genuine deterrent to people considering a life of crime. Like public floggings."

2. "You say political freedom, I hear vote-buying," says popular anarchist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If these fat cats get their way, politicians will buy their own seat in Congress.

"There's no justification for them in today's society. We need tighter regulations on who can hold guns, so only our police and military have them."

A large group of @@NAME@@'s uninsured citizens have petitioned the government to provide a universal healthcare system, citing the poor health of many low and middle-class workers. Some of the more vocal of them are threatening violence if something isn't done.

The Debate
*1. "A universal healthcare system would provide everyone with the same quality healthcare the more wealthy and well-insured currently receive," says recently laid-off citizen and civil rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Sure, taxes would probably have to increase a bit. But isn't it worth it to provide our lower-class citizens with the same opportunities the upper-class citizens have?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**2. "Are you all INSANE? This will ruin the health insurance business and drive up unemployment rates," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the largest insurance provider in @@NAME@@. "If everyone working for their health insurance could suddenly get it free, there would be fewer jobs filled. It would get worse for everyone involved. The government should investigate the motives of these troublemaking 'protestors', instead!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

***3. "Why do we have to choose either radical option?" says your Secretary of Health, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Couldn't we just provide limited basic healthcare for our citizens and have major operations covered by private health insurance? It would be more affordable and the poor would suffer less than they do under the current system." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "A universal healthcare system is a core tenet of socialist society," says Communist Party ideologue @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Sure, taxes would probably have to increase a bit. But isn't it worth it to provide our noble workers with good healthcare, free at the point of delivery?" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

**5. "Are you all INSANE? This will drain the coffers of the State!" argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, of the @@NAME@@ Funds Disbursement Council. "If the wealth of the people is wasted on a bloated and inefficient health service, the nation will be detrimented. The government should investigate the motives of these troublemaking 'protesters', instead!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

***6. "Why do we have to choose either radical option?" asks Senior Party Representative @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Couldn't we just provide very limited basic healthcare for the majority of our citizens and have more comprehensive care as a perk from advancing within the Communist Party hierarchy? It would be more affordable, and all would aspire to better themselves." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

The Issue
Divers from a local scuba club have discovered an enormous underwater gold deposit that could be worth billions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in one of @@NAME@@'s lakes. It has also caused a huge debate over who should be allowed to plunder the goods.

The Debate
1. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a cabinet member, would like the government to seize the deposit. "This is an excellent time to boost @@NAME@@'s economy and increase our foreign trade with other countries! Who cares about the people that discovered the deposit? They've done their country a great favor and should let us have the money!"

2. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a civil rights activist, vehemently disagrees. "The deposit was found by private citizens and it should be their choice of what to do with the gold. If the government goes around stealing what is rightfully ours, then I shudder to think I live in such a corrupt country. These people discovered the gold, it's now their time to get rich! Nevermind the fact they were diving in a lake on government property!"

3. "We should do what now?" Environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ exclaims. "Do you have any idea how damaging it would be to the environment to mine the gold under that lake? Think of all the aquatic life that would be disrupted or destroyed! Think of how an otherwise pristine lake view would be ruined!

The Issue
After a sixty-year-old man with distressingly flappy armpits streaked past cameras and millions of sports fans during the snooker league playoffs, protesters have called for tougher action.

1. "This can't go on!" says traumatized snooker player @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "Children are watching sports and having them exposed to this lewd behaviour is unacceptable! I demand that these people be locked up for several years and maybe they'll have learnt their lesson!"

2. "Oh don't be ridiculous!" scoffs prolific streaker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "It's all just a bit of fun and the kids shouldn't be wrapped in cotton wool, or they'll learn nothing! Sports are so dull anyway, it needs a little bare skin to liven it up. Streaking should be legal!"

"Perhaps we should set some guidelines for what is acceptable as art and what isn't. Artistic renditions of people getting it on are one thing.

The Debate
1. General @@RANDOM_NAME@@ says, "We should spend more. But not just on exploration. We should start developing Orbital Weapons! Space Marines! Armed Spacecraft! We would rule the region, and look cool doing it! Just divert some funding from environmental protection, and BAM! Sci-fi goodies!"

The Issue
Many people are starting to think that it's time to put term limits on elected officials, given the average age of 70 years old and 40 years of service in the nation's Parliament.

The Debate
1. "It's time to get these lifetime politicians off the government payroll!" says term-limits advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Let them get real jobs like the rest of us once they leave office. Besides, if they are currently a Senator, they can always run for another office like Governor.

2. "Wait a minute," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chairman of the national Infinite Power party. "We pay a lot of money to get those people into office. It can take several terms before we get a return on our investment, I mean, candidates.

"Depression has significant effects on groups and individuals, especially amongst teenagers.

3. "This raises an interesting issue," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, staunch supporter of birth control. "And that is: why do we need to build more housing anyway? Why don't we just limit the number of children each family can have? Besides, pregnancy causes all sorts of complications. We're better off with less of it anyway."

[b][anchor=69]#69[/anchor]: Power Problems Need Bright Solution [Plumbumia; ed: Reploid Productions][/b]

The Issue
The oldest power station in @@NAME@@ suffered a catastrophic failure last night, plunging a third of the power supply grid of @@CAPITAL@@ into darkness. There is no debate that it needs to be replaced, but the question is with what?

The Debate
1. "The solution is clear," says environmental activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Wind turbines and solar power stations are the cleanest there are. We must switch power production to forms of renewable energy, that will never run out. The only minor problems are that wind farms will take up a great deal of space and of course we can't exactly rely on the weather. It isn't as though we control it. But think of how much healthier people will be without all that pollution!"

2. "Wind power? Solar collectors? Bah! Have you ever wondered when the least amount of strain is placed on the national grid? WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING!" exclaims Southern @@NAME@@ Electra official @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We need power under our control, and cheaply. Coal has been the cheapest and most abundant power source for ages. We don't need this airy fairy wind malarky when we have cheap and reliable power available for all. True, pollution will be a bit on the heavy side but I'm sure that's only a minor problem, with how well funded our health system is!"

3. "Now the way I see it is that it's either green, expensive, and sprawling; or compact, polluting and cheap. Wouldn't it be nice if we had the best of both worlds? Well, we can!" claims fission technician @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Nuclear power is reliable, clean, and although it isn't cheap, it won't break the bank. There is a risk of deadly meltdown, but this is relatively small, and the only people who could be against this are anti-nuclear protesters, but what do we care about those tree-hugging hippies?"

4. "They're right, religion shouldn't have a role in our government, but they don't go far enough," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@ at a local AA (Atheists Anonymous) meeting. "Few things have caused more death and suffering in this world than religion. Just look at the Crusades and the Jihads throughout history! This should be treated like the mental disorder that it is. Remember, religion teaches intolerance, and we cannot accept that!"

5. "Oh Lord, please don't let our noble leader listen to these extremists!" prays your religious advisor, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Religion is an important guiding force in peoples' lives, but we have no right to force it on people. Atheists, since they don't have a religion, are less ethical and their actions cost society more, so it's only fair that they should be taxed more heavily to make up the difference."

1. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Culture, has nothing but disdain for the demonstrators. "The language of @@NAME@@ is as important to our national identity as our history is. A truly erudite individual uses perfect grammar and refuses to speak as those ruffians do." Your Finance Minister is quick to chime in as well, "If business is required to print every road sign, instruction manual, and fast-food wrapper in two languages, it would increase everybody's overhead.

The Issue
A coalition of tribalists, health experts, and civil rights proponents have recently suggested legalizing cannibalism for consumers of willing would-be meals.

1. "I see absolutely no problem with people digging into each other at dinnertime, so long as everyone is willing," @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the editor of the monthly magazine '[i]To Serve Man[/i]', quips, "Not only does it solve hunger problems and create jobs, but it also adds variety to @@NAME@@'s sometimes dull palette."

2. Civil rights leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@ came out publicly for moderate pro-cannibalism legislation, commenting, "While it may strike some as a crude, even evil practice, our ancestors have practiced cannibalism for years. If we create a government organization to strictly regulate and grade all human meat prior to its arrival on the market, we can ensure that respect for diversity is maintained while health concerns are also allayed. And instead of killing average people, why not make being turned into snack foods a post-mortem option? Like donating your body to science!"

"A student wants to go to a particular school, but lacks the grades. Clearly, he should have studied harder in school. But oh, because he's a so-called minority, it's everyone else's fault.

"Oh yes, it's all perfectly equal, if we ignore the fact that this poor boy was stacking shelves to pay for textbooks in a falling-down school while the nice rich boys were enjoying private tutoring!

2. "Ah, the expense!" moans @@RANDOM_NAME@@, government economist. "Do you have any idea what that would cost?! A much better way of dealing with this waste is to burn it and use the energy it produces to power @@NAME@@'s big cities.

A recent case in which a very impatient driver attacked and seriously injured a slow driver has brought the subject rapidly to the highest levels of the government.

"@@NAME@@'s highways were constructed with a far smaller number of cars in mind, and we've exceeded that traffic load by a substantial amount, resulting in traffic jams.

The Debate
1. "Similar schemes have been very effective elsewhere," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@NAME@@'s most infamous traffic warden. "It's common sense that the best way to curb dangerously high demand is to raise the price of the supply - or, as in this case, to create a price. Charging citizens to go into more congested areas could, combined with the improvements to public transport it will finance, actually make people choose public transport over their cars. I don't see why people shouldn't pay tax for a little less traffic on our roads."

2. "These tolls are a preposterous idea," argues road lobbyist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Public transport will never replace the car - I don't want to be forced to share my space with a bunch of malodorous working-class people on my way to work. Not that I would be, because I could afford the charge, but really, it's the principle of the matter! The only solution is to expand urban road networks.

The Issue
After a recent survey discovered that nearly 40% of all citizens in @@NAME@@ are single, there has been an increasingly loud call for the legalisation of prostitution.

The Debate
1. "I just can't get a girl no matter what I do," laments acne-afflicted nerd, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If the cops would just look the other way about prostitution, it'd make my life much easier. Yeah, I'd be risking all sorts of diseases, but it's my body isn't it?"

2. "We can't allow this to happen!" protests Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, senior pathologist of @@NAME@@'s largest hospital. "Prostitution is a dangerous business and must remain illegal! People need to be more aware of the consequences that could follow like the risk of contracting HIV, chlamydia, or even syphilis. I say we get some funding for a large awareness programme on sexually transmitted diseases and maybe then people will act responsibly between the covers. It'll be expensive sure, but well worth it."

3. "Not so fast now!" interjects daring entrepreneur, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why don't we just have the prostitution industry run by the government? By letting the government regulate prostitution, @@NAME@@ can force any patrons to undergo tests for diseases, make prostitutes have regular medical check-ups and pay a portion of their profits to the government. Of course we'd still have to put more policemen on the streets to keep illegal brothels from popping up and make sure the hospitals are equipped to handle the extra workload, but you can always raise taxes to account for that."

The Issue
Scientists at a private medical research laboratory have announced that they have produced a drug which will combat @@NAME@@'s most notorious malady - Spon Plague.

The Debate
1. "This pill is the only known and unknown cure for the Spon Plague!" proclaims Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the inventor of the cure. "But if we are to go ahead with the production of this drug, we must get some government support. We're set to make a fortune from this drug - the money we earn will help us develop even more cures for other as-yet untreatable diseases. Some people won't be able to afford it of course, but hard cheese on them: they should have got a paying job while they were still capable."

2. "That's a disgraceful way to think!" says equal rights activist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "So the people who need the most help shouldn't get any? I propose that the government subsidises the production of all drugs so everyone can benefit from them, rich or not! That way the money-hungry corporations won't profit from the suffering of the masses. Of course there will be the matter of a small tax rise to fund it - but what's that when lives will be saved?"

[3]. "I can't believe what I'm hearing," deplores well-respected religious leader, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If God didn't want people to have this disease he wouldn't have created it in the first place. This is completely against the will of God and if the government allows this drug to go on sale we will all be doomed to an afterlife in a dark and fiery place! Now let's end this madness and abolish the production of pharmaceuticals and drugs altogether!" [[color=purple]Must have Atheism[/color]]

The Issue
In light of @@NAME@@'s ban on gambling, people ranging from angry homemakers to allegedly legitimate businessmen have been arguing incessantly about whether or not banning casinos was a good idea.

The Debate
1. "We are highly distressed at your decision to revoke our casino licences," says FamilyCorp. Representative 'Fat Tony', sipping a glass of fine wine. "If the ban were to be revoked, think of all the money you could get from your cut of the profit. In addition, it would help ensure the safety of assorted members of @@NAME@@'s government. I think this is an offer that you should not refuse."

2. "These casinos cannot be allowed to reopen!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an ex-gambling addict. "Remember what happened last time? People get out of control and lose their life's savings! Just say no to these so-called legitimate businesses! And crack down on the rest of organized crime while you're at it."

3. "There is a solution to this problem," says Native @@NAME@@ite chief Dances-With-@@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@. "You could let us front the casinos as payback for stealing our land, and we'll enforce age limits and pay some tax on the income these casinos generate. Just think of the jobs it could create for us, and the boost to the economy!"

[b][anchor=109]#109[/anchor]: Karate Kids Cause Controversy [Yarrum; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
Free, youth-orientated martial arts programmes have gained popularity in communities where youth crime is a problem.

The Debate
1. "What better way to keep kids off of the streets?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a professional judo instructor. "It's fun, good exercise and gives an invaluable insight into our nation's culture! Judo teaches personal balance, and it improves the health of both mind and body. But self-defence programmes like mine will need government funding to really make a difference - surely the public wouldn't mind paying a little more tax to put an end to the gangs of yobs prowling the streets?"

2. "It's a good idea, but it's not taking it far enough!" declares General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, after ranting about 'kids these days'. "If we could conscript these hoodlums into the army, we'd be able to put their skills to good use. No one would mess with @@NAME@@ if we had a butt-kickin' karate unit on the battlefield! It may be a little expensive, but we can just take money out of the education budget since these kids will be under our tuition. Their families may not be happy about it, but remember this: these young lads will be getting to do something which is the envy of every hot-blooded citizen - fight for their country against blood-sucking foreigners!"

3. "This is ridiculous!" comments police officer, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Teach junior thugs how to fight? Good idea, why don't we teach them how to make bombs out of duct-tape and cheese next? I say we ban this archaic mode of combat which only serves to encourage these punks in their violent ways, and introduce more government funding for the police force! With more cash we could really show the little blighters what discipline's all about."

4. "Discipline? Oh heavens no, our lives are already too restricted by the iron cage of rules and policing," says unorthodox youth pastor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, seen weaving a basket from blades of grass. "Our young people need to reconnect with the spirit within, and the best way to do that is to be one with nature and appreciate the bounty all around us. Redirect some of those police funds to my summer camps, and then youths can learn how to live freely and simply by crafting their own supplies from scratch."

Various opinions have been brought to your attention over what your closest advisors are referring to as the 'anarchy situation'.

The Debate
1. "We've got to do something about this chaos!" yells General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, firing a rifle at a band of armed looters. "There's no order in this country! No one is safe! We must rebuild the army and crack down on the militant groups ravaging our fair land! It's the only way we will ever return the cesspit of crime and depravity @@NAME@@ has become to a land of law and order!"

2. Returning fire, both figuratively and literally, is @@RANDOM_NAME@@, biker gang leader and anarchist: "That there's anyone claiming to be a government is ludicrous. People should be allowed to determine their own fate and survival without fear of breaking these inhibiting laws! All government officials should be removed at once, [i]and all government departments stripped of all funding[/i], if this country is ever to become well and truly 'equal'!"

3. "I've got a different idea," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your minister of commerce, speaking from his hiding place under a desk. "Television viewers in more developed countries actually like seeing gratuitous violence. We could put up cameras in some of the more dangerous streets and sell the broadcasting rights to foreign networks.

The Issue
Politicians from a distant and obscure part of @@NAME@@ have been calling for the government to split @@NAME@@ into various semi-autonomous regions, each with an elected council to govern their designated area.

The Debate
1. "The government is too centralised," complains rural villager, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We get these big-city politicians making rulings that affect our way of life, when they have absolutely no idea what our way of life is! One of them even suggested that farmers should be banned from picking crops in case they disturbed the local wildlife! What we need are various councils to govern their own part of @@NAME@@, giving us the chance to have our say on laws affecting our area. It'll bring politics to the people! Of course this will require the implementation of a council tax to fund it all, but if that's the cost of more political freedom, then so be it!"

2. "Councils? Are you mad?" gasps political commentator, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Most of the politicians we already have earn very large sums each year - and you want to employ even more?! We must not listen to the whims of some dangerous separatist movement; next they'll be wanting independence! I suggest we keep the government in one place where we can keep an eye on it and stop creating more jobs for over-paid politicians. Heck, why not trim off the ones we don't need while we're at it and give some leeway to the taxpayers? Anyway, if we allowed places like West @@NAME@@ to make decisions for themselves, they would soon be introducing laws allowing them to marry their cousins or something - you know what they're like..."

3. "These people are obviously power-hungry lunatics," whispers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your innumerable advisors. "They're simply trying to loosen your grip on the nation! Let's just send anyone who opposes your absolute rule to the gallows and ban elections. We hardly need them when you always know what to do! There may be some protest, but we can just lower taxes and they'll be as happy as clams."

The Issue
A growing group of @@NAME@@'s citizens are battling for an end to unrequested solicitations from salesmen.

The Debate
1. "This has to stop," says mild-mannered parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "My family can't even have dinner without being interrupted at least five times by telemarketers or door-to-door salesmen! My privacy is being invaded! The government ought to ban all forms of unrequested solicitations from salespeople. The sanity of the populace is at stake here!"

2. "This must be a joke," retorts insurance sales solicitor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, in between cold calls. "Telemarketing and door-to-door sales are some of the most effective methods of increasing revenues. Banning them would be a huge blow to business, and put thousands of workers out of their jobs! Let's face the facts - @@NAME@@ needs an economy, and banning cold calls isn't the best of ways to improve it! One way you could improve it would be to, say, give us some government funds.

[b][anchor=113]#113[/anchor]: Test Results Deemed 'Ungood' After Global Survey [Der Angst; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
In a worldwide survey, it has been revealed that @@NAME@@'s population has been graded 'dim' by international comparison.

The Debate
1. "These results are terrible!" wails @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a concerned teacher. "Something has to be done, and done quickly, if anyone's going to take today's youth seriously. It's high time we started to promote our gifted children; it is they who are the ones that bring us forward! The rest of today's youth shouldn't worry though, a basic education should be enough for a factory worker."

2. "This is indeed a problem, and I believe it's a result of the social inequality in @@NAME@@," comments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a well-known social reformer. "It is obvious that students from different social classes will score differently in the tests. We can't condemn all these kids to a life of inferiority because of a gifted minority. Instead we should make sure that everyone can follow the lessons! Lower the teaching level, so that even the less intellectually-orientated can keep up with the class. The nerds can always teach themselves; it would be unfair to provide them with extra funds after all."

3. "This is stupid, it would ruin our nation's population of skilled workers!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a college professor. "There's never enough able-minded citizens for the more specialised careers. We must force our less-intelligent to learn! Get their noses right against the grindstone! Let's raise the bar a bit so even our best students have to sweat whilst learning! The others will of course be forced to learn even more to keep in touch, but that just shows them how real life works. To fund it, well, our defence budget is already too large, if you ask me."

The Issue
After a recent national survey revealed that almost three-quarters of the population only know the primary language of @@NAME@@, there have been rising calls for the government to take action.

The Debate
1. "Fluency in foreign languages is imperative to education," says Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of @@CAPITAL@@ University. "Learning a new tongue not only gives a child a practical, marketable skill, but also encourages compassion and understanding of foreign cultures. With so many nations in the world, I do insist that we increase government funding in these areas and make it a compulsory part of the curriculum.

The Issue
After waning sales, the well-established soda company 'Eckie-Ecola' has appealed to the government for the right to use powerful mind-altering drugs in their products.

The Debate
1. "It'll be great," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of Eckie-Ecola. "Nice 'n' happy floating feelings all in a can, and all for just one @@CURRENCY@@! It's not the healthiest drink I admit, but what people want to do with their bodies is their own business. If you ban this beverage, you're only denying the citizens of their right to be exposed to the true hallucenogenic experience!"

2. "This can't go ahead," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a nurse at one of @@NAME@@'s hospitals. "Drugs are, and always will be, one of the greatest threats to the nation's physical and mental health! My job's hard enough as it is without having the wards overrun by patients who were stupid enough to drink the damned stuff.

The Issue
Recently, medical insurance premiums across the nation have been skyrocketing following several highly-publicised medical-malpractice lawsuits, making it even costlier than ever to get treatment. Doctors are asking the government to step in.

The Debate
1. "These lawsuits are driving up the price of medical insurance," complains Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I'm losing customers - patients, I mean - and it's becoming increasingly difficult for doctors like me to do our jobs without worrying about being bankrupted by some kid who didn't like the hospital food. Everyone makes mistakes. Look at politicians, they make them all the time and do they get fired? No. We must outlaw the medical-malpractice lawsuits undermining our healthcare system!"

2. "All that these doctors are interested in is saving their own necks," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of 'I Can't Believe It's A Law Firm!'. "They were negligent in the course of their work and are unwilling to pay the price. I mean, how do you perform a heart transplant on the wrong guy unless you're not paying attention? I for one think that our citizens deserve better from the healthcare service, and if doctors cause damage, they should pay for it. It's that simple. If some decent doctors get caught up in it, then it's surely their own fault for not being careful enough?"

3. "The problem is capitalism," insists @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while trying to burn a @@CURRENCY@@ with a lighter. "The doctors are only trying to help their patients, and those class traitors at the insurance industry are only trying to make a profit out of people's misery on those rare occasions when things go wrong. I say we outlaw the insurance industry and then the good doctors will be safe while the bad ones go out of business. Everyone wins! Apart from the insurance people, I guess."

4. "The problem certainly is capitalism," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a famed socialist. "But outlawing the insurance industry will not solve the main problem: the healthcare system itself! It's disgusting! I've seen paramedics check wallets before injuries! We must introduce a national health service and put some healthy investment into medical colleges, hospitals, and the likes. Then we'll have an over-abundance of competent doctors! The insurance industry won't be able to raise a finger to it and the citizens won't have to pay for treatment. Except through tax, of course."

The Issue
After watching the movie 'The Fast and the Belligerent', boyracers from all over @@NAME@@ have been petitioning for the abolition of speed limits.

The Debate
1. "Today's cars are safer at high speeds than ever before," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, editor of Sports Car Monthly. "And long-distance commuters are tired of spending hours on the road just to get to the next city. Abolishing the speed limit would be great for the economy too! People would be more likely to go out and buy cars if they thought they'd be able to use them properly. It seems like such a shame to be puttering along at the speed limit in a magnificent car like the 450HP twin-turbo @@ANIMAL@@ SX/T-7700 you know."

2. "Are you crazy?" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a road-accident victim. "We need lower speed limits on automobiles, not higher. You might as well enforce mandatory blindfolds on the road too, it'll come to the same conclusion! People's lives are at stake here! If people were made to drive at, say, no faster than fifty kilometres per hour, I would feel a lot happier walking the streets. Besides, if it takes a long time to get places via car then people might begin using mass transit for once."

3. "I think the current speed limits are fine, but we need better enforcement," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the most feared traffic warden in @@NAME@@. "If we required GPS tracking devices in all vehicles, we'd ticket every single speeder, no problem. In addition, we could monitor the movements of criminals and other suspicious individuals, and vastly reduce the risk of crime, terrorism, and other subversive activity.

The Issue
Representatives of several minor political parties have joined their voices to object to stiff ballot access requirements.

The Debate
1. "Two-party politics is squeezing the life out of democracy in @@NAME@@," laments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leader of the Pragmatic Radical Party. "The Liberal Conservatives and Progressive Traditionalists have a monopoly on public policy - or duopoly, whatever you want to call it. The point is that there's hardly any difference between them, and their chokehold on the electoral process lets hacks and crooks stay in office forever. Ballot access rules must be loosened so we can give the voters a truly democratic choice."

2. "People are afraid to support 'third' parties because they're afraid of seeing the 'bad guys' get elected," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a ballot stastician. "But if we changed the system to allow preferential voting, where you can have your votes divvied up among your other candidates if your favourite doesn't recieve a certain number of votes, then that wouldn't be a problem. Then you could let as many parties as you wanted into the game. Deserving candidates wouldn't be harmed - they'd win! Maybe a few radicals would get through, but that just proves what a great system it is!"

3. "What ever happened to 'one man, one vote'?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chairperson of the Liberal Conservative National Committee. "Changing the rules will just let all sorts of crackpots clog up the ballot and overwhelm voters with names they don't recognise - this will draw attention and support away from legitimate candidates! How do you expect the nation to function properly if the government doesn't have public support? Oh, and by the way, the Liberal Conservative Party presents a VERY clear alternative to the destructive agenda of the Progressive Traditionalists, and I'll wallop anyone who says otherwise."

4. "Opposition parties are such a bother," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your chief of staff. "If we allowed as many of them to be politicians as those fools in the Pragmatic Radical Party want, it would be very hard on the tax payers - and our own position in power. If we re-wrote the election rules so that a party had to reapply for recognition every time it failed to win a certain number of votes, we could knock our opposition out of the ring for good!

"But, on the other hand, we have been waiting for this major medical breakthrough for a long time. Imagine it - no more waiting lists for transplants!

The Debate
1. "Why should Arts students get to lounge around reading books and watching daytime TV for hours on end, when some of our hard-working youngsters are dedicating themselves to the study of worthwhile and valuable subjects; studies which will benefit the nation as a whole?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a student engineer. "We should be grooming our young people to help, not sponge off the system. The Arts should be considered a hobby, not a career."

2. "You can't mean that," gasps Prof. Catherine Gratwick, renowned worldwide for her paintings of trains. "Learning should be done out of love, not duty. The study of the Arts has been a noble field for many centuries, and learning it is not as easy as you think. I'd rather die than live in a world where creativity is stifled. We should be encouraging young artists, writers, musicians - if only to strengthen @@NAME@@'s cultural reputation."

3. "What's the point in allowing most young people to continue in further education anyway?" enquires @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a factory manager. "Surely most students would be better employed in manual and factory work? You should handpick a select few to study medicine, the law, science, and business of course, and utilise the majority of youth to increase the country's productivity in industry. Academic freedom just gets in the way of a functioning society, I've always said."

The Issue
Angry crowds formed yesterday around government offices in @@NAME@@, demanding the reinstatement of free and fair elections.

The Debate
1. "Give us the vote!" cries protester @@RANDOM_NAME@@, before hurling another volley of eggs. "It is the right of the many to decide who leads our country, not the few! If we don't get democracy right now, we'll... we'll, uh... we'll throw more eggs, that's what we'll do! Don't say you haven't been warned!"

They're never happy! One moment they're demanding democracy, the next they'll be complaining about all the new taxes! If we dropped taxes, you'd find that they'd be much more compliant.

The Issue
As the nation's unemployment rate skyrockets, citizens have staged a massive protest against corporations outsourcing jobs to poorer nations to take advantage of the lax regulations and cheap labour.

The Debate
1. "This is unacceptable!" decrees @@RANDOM_NAME@@, outspoken representative of the National Union of Telephone-based Salesmen. "Sixteen call-centres round the country have already closed because they found they could get cheaper workers in some country no-one's ever heard of! If businesses are allowed to pack up shop and ship jobs out to other countries, our own people will be unemployed and out on the streets. The government must ban this evil corporate practice immediately!"

2. "Nonsense!" scoffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, manager of human resources at Ekin, a popular sportswear company. "Outsourcing jobs to where the labour is cheap means we can slash costs. That means we can have lower prices for the good consumers - uh - citizens of @@NAME@@. There're plenty of other jobs besides factory-working you know, and with the influx of cheaper products they really shouldn't have anything to complain about."

3. "The only reason that companies are so unwilling to stay here is because of the constricting regulations," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a ridiculously wealthy businessman. "Every time my company tries to make a decision, we run up against about a million laws forbidding us from our ventures. Since when has making money been a crime? Allow more economic freedom and companies will be simply flocking to this country. The workers will suffer a bit from losing minimum wage laws, of course, but that's progress for you."

[b][anchor=127]#127[/anchor]: Aging Concerns In @@NAME@@ [Sirocco; ed: Reploid Productions][/b]

The Issue
Fears about the aging population in @@NAME@@ have been raised after it was discovered that nearly a fifth of the population is over 65 years of age and becoming a serious drain on pension funds everywhere.

The Debate
1. "We're going to run out of working age citizens if we don't act fast!" warns @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a government statistician. "Birth rates are down, death rates are down, and the amount of budget spent on pensions has doubled in the last twenty years! We need to put an end to this, quickly and without delay: we must get rid of all the people too old to work anymore... well, except for government officials like you and me of course..."

2. "I can't believe I'm hearing this!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a wizened octogenerian. "We have our rights! What utter rubbish about our pensions; I can hardly survive on the paltry number of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ I get each week. If anything, we should get more money. And after the BILLIONS of workhours I put in for @@NAME@@, it's the least the government could do in return."

3. "Well, you know, there is another way," suggests @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, your sleaziest budget analyst. "To appease the elderly lobby, you could increase the pension fund by cutting the healthcare budget. That way higher death rates will compensate for the more generous pensions. In fact, with fewer pensioners to support, slashing healthcare could be the fastest way to build up a budget surplus." She smiles menacingly.

4. "Woah, woah! Talk about hasty decisions here, man," says Kool Kal, one of your more hip advisors. "Just increase the working age to say... ninety-five years old? Then the number of people eligible for a pension is like, dramatically reduced, man. Why? It's 'cos most of them'll be like, six feet under, dude!" He high-fives you. "Funny, ain't it, man?"

5. "There's no need for anything so controversial," posits @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Manager of the Department of Leaver Earnings of Wall To Wall Mart. "If our working age population can't support the pensions our retirees deserve, then clearly we need more workers. There are plenty of talented Maxtopians, Marche Noirians, and Big- well... and lots of Bigtopians too, queueing up to get jobs in this country. If we open our borders to them, we'll have more than enough taxpayers to support elderly @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ well into retirement. Everyone's a winner." [[color=red]Must not have Immigration[/color]]

The Issue
Schools are considering banning all signs of religious affliation to "promote unity amongst students". Minority groups and civil rights activists have expressed their outrage in protests outside parliament.

The Debate
1. Minister for Public Unity and General Goodwill, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, has supported the claim, "This move will encourage students from different cultural and religious backgrounds to mix more freely. Removed of any symbols of difference, barriers of cultural otherness will be transcended and all will feel a sense of shared nationhood, which is what state schools should be encouraging. Social equality is what we're aiming for here. Not controversy."

2. "This is an outrageous proposition!" says shopkeeper @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Everyone should have the right to follow their religion. I organise my store in strict terms of religious and cultural preferences. A Kosher section for the Jews, a "Fish on Fridays" freezer for the Catholics and a vegan section way on the other side of the shop, away from the meat counter for those bald people in the orange robes. Freedom and diversity is what makes our nation great, and if everyone feels that this means they shouldn't integrate then so be it!"

3. "Who needs religion anyway?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Professor of Biology at @@CAPITAL@@ University of Science. "Our nation is swamped in the mumbo-jumbo spouted by these money hungry crackpot evangelists. I say the people should be spared from these wacko delusions of gods and demons. ALL symbols of religion should be removed from ALL public spaces! Now that's what I call freedom."

1. "This society should be protected from us!" says anthropologist and Star Trek nut, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Have you ever heard of the prime directive? We must protect cultures from damaging modern influence! It is not our right to go and change the way these people live. Let them be."

*2. "Who says we need to 'preserve' these tribes?" asks Timothy Burre, CEO of 'Loggers & Lumberjacks'. "We should be developing them instead.

4. "These savages are disgraceful," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a senior member of the National Rocket-launcher Association. "I don't see why we should stoop so low as to do business with them. If they're on land we want then we should just take it. It's not even as if it's theirs after all, they just happen to be living there. These people are no better than animals, I say we allow citizens to shoot the lot of them! It'll knock down two birds with one stone!"

5. "The matter is not what we do to this culture, it is whether or not the people who belong to this culture actually want to be a part of that culture!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a student sociologist. "We must stop knocking down rainforests so that the older members of the tribes can stay, yet allow the younger and more idealistic members leave if they wish and join civilisation!

The Issue
Filibustering, where politicians attempt to keep a debate on new laws going indefinitely, has been plaguing recent attempts to pass bills. Several aged politicians have been orating non-stop throughout three days worth of debating time, stopping any legislation from being passed.

The Debate
1. "This sham of a tactic is totally demolishing our ability to accomplish anything!" complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Minister of Ministries. "Who cares if a few old fossils fail to see reason? The majority of the government clearly wants this legislation to pass! Just set a limit on the time a person can speak for; this really is demeaning to the democratic process!"

2. While taking a bathroom break before moving on to read aloud from the phonebook, @@RANDOM_NAME@@ states: "It is a great thing for the minority and the oppressed that our system of government allows the filibuster to be utilised to harness the majority! Let the hills, the mountains, and the valleys reverberate with the sounds of our voices! We will not surrender to this repugnant legislation."

3. "The filibuster is not enough to protect the minority, since they are too afraid of the tyrannical majority to use it," says political commentator, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I suggest that all legislation must require a unanimous vote before it can pass. That way, nobody goes away unhappy."

4. "Why do we need to debate legislature anyway?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Alternative Solutions, who also happens to be the best friend of your distant cousin. "Everything would be so much more simple if we just decide what to do, and do it. After all, we're the ones who know what's best for @@NAME@@.

"The right to duel is one found throughout history for the honourable settling of disputes and I must insist that my right to fight be recognised!

2. "Swords? Heavens, what dreadful things. All sharp and pointy - quite dangerous, you know," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an ardent pacifist. "Duelling ought to be banned! The best way to settle these kind of arguments are through judicially-supervised mediation, we all know that. If we go ahead with what these duelling nutters want then innocent people will die!

1. "These creatures are a danger to the public and must be destroyed!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, representative of the Public Institution for Social Safety, Equality, and Direction. "I was attacked by one just on the way here and I nearly lost my life! They're a public menace. We must shoot and burn them!"

2. "Why punish the poor things?" asks animal-lover @@RANDOM_NAME@@, covered in scars from previous encounters with @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@. "All they need is good hands to care and rehabilitate them.

The Issue
After numerous alleged UFO sightings all over @@NAMES@@'s sky last night, concerned citizens are asking questions and getting no answers. Many of them are demanding that the government release all information regarding UFOs to the public.

The Debate
1. "The government has been covering up UFO activity for years," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, host of the esoteric TV show 'Death from the Skies'. "We're tired of hearing about weather balloons and hoaxes. If there are little green men watching and abducting us, we deserve to know. We demand that the government release all documents regarding UFOs... and everything else too! Besides, we're better off if our military doesn't organize shady, expensive projects."

2. "You can't honestly give in to the demands of these wackos and conspiracy nuts!" gasps Five Star General @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "That would reveal top secret military programs like our doomsday device, I mean, new fighter jets. These things are kept secret for a reason. Do you want this information to get in the hands of @@NAME@@'s enemies? I don't think so. I say we continue to cover up these sightings and ignore those pesky ufologists asking too many questions."

3. "How about a compromise that pleases both the conspiracy theorists and the military?" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an elite prevaricator from the Propaganda Ministry. "Why don't we release some documents that just say that UFOs are real? This way the conspiracy theorists stop asking questions, and the military doesn't have its secret projects compromised. If our military projects are discovered, like that "moon" we're building, we can just blame it on little green men. That gives you perfect deniability. It's win-win!"

Shameful! Our workers, and I tell you we have a great many of them, can barely get to work thanks to disruption by protesters and all that hippie nonsense.

3. Your Minister of Trade advises taking a middle ground: "We can't ban arms sales without harming the quality of our military and police departments, not to mention the economy. These hippies do have a point though - guns are terrible things in the wrong hands. We should implement additional safety checks on the groups to which the weapons get sold. That way we don't lose too many sales, and the people are persuaded we are making a stand against nations who use the weapons for immoral ends.

The Debate
1. "I'm constantly surrounded by over-zealous policemen!" deplores @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a spokesman for the group. "Just last week I was arrested for letting my baby cry too loudly in public! This is ridiculous! The government needs to cut back the police force and let citizens get on with their lives without interference! If that means allowing muggers, thieves, burglars, pickpockets, murderers and all the rest to not have coppers breathing down the back of their necks constantly then so be it! This really is too much!"

2. "You can't listen to what they're saying!" gasps Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@, horrified. "These nuts would have us living in utter anarchy! If some robbers suddenly decide to break into a shop and steal everything, what's the owner going to do? What could anyone do without a well-funded police force? There has to be justice and law or we'd be nothing better than a bunch of savages. Stick to your guns, I say, and let me arrest these subversives - people need to be taught to show some respect!"

The Issue
A group of local motorists have assembled outside of City Hall to protest against the shoddy state of roads in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "These roads are terrible!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the @@NAME@@ Auto Club. "Every few feet there's a crack, or a pothole, or a gravel patch, or the remains of someone else's car! It's really too much! And just look at this-" he adds, rubbing a nasty bruise on his forehead - "I got that from my rear-view mirror after flying over a bump on Main Street! These roads must be fixed! There really needs to be vast improvements made now, before anyone gets seriously hurt."

2. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, avowed anti-spending advocate, disagrees: "Road construction? What a waste of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@! If people can still drive on them, then the roads are fine as they are. Spending more to make trivial repairs would just be a waste of the tax payers' money! We should just ignore these whiners and leave the roads as they are and if the drivers don't like that - well... then they can just learn to walk like the rest of us."

*3. "Why on Earth is it the government's responsibility to build and maintain roads?" asks bicyclist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pausing for breath. "Not all citizens own automobiles, you know. The government should be trying to make life better for all, not just car owners! If people want roads, then let private industry build them, and they can charge tolls to the people who actually drive on them. Leave the government out of it!"

The Issue
During the construction of a new Hyper-Mega-Ultra-Super Mall, construction workers have unearthed what appears to be an ancient temple. A furious debate has arisen between those who wish to preserve it, and those who need their retail therapy.

The Debate
1. "This is the perfect opportunity to learn more of our nation's history!" says Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the archaeological department of the @@NAME@@ History Museum. "All building work must be halted immediately so that my team can study this remarkable piece of our nation's past. To bury these ruins under some concrete eyesore would be criminal!"

2. "It's all very nice to get to know some more about our past," argues foreman @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "But that's just the thing! It's the past! We must think of the future. If you allow those decrepit fossils to take over this place, you put at risk the future of our economy! Today it's archaeological digs, tomorrow it's 'preservation of the environment'. Just let me bulldoze the worthless pile of rubble and bury it under a few hundred tonnes of concrete."

The Issue
Several animal rights groups have protested the continuing use of fur as a material for clothing.

The Debate
1. "This is an outrage!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the Be Nice To Animals society. "The manufacture of fur apparel is unethical, cruel, and disgusting! People just don't seem to realise that millions of animals die each year in fur farms, crammed into tiny cages and suffering the most terrible treatment just so someone can look appealing and rich! This is a sick practice and must be stopped! The same can go for leather shoes and snakeskin belts too."

2. "You can't mean that, surely?" snorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, adjusting a hat, made from real @@ANIMAL@@ hide. "It's the people's choice what they wear. I don't think it's fair that the majority of the public should be deprived of fur clothes because some people are a bit queasy. In fact, if the government would allow us to stock rarer animals, we could produce even finer products. In the end, it's up to the consumer, don't you think?"

"As you can see from my brilliant experiments, science has now solved zer problems of zer vorld und ve need nothink else!

"We cannot allow their transgressions against the HOLY truth to continue! All the heathens should be thankful we don't burn them at the stake for their devilry! This nation's true and just government must ban the filth and corruption being spread bah these WICKED men!"

3. "What I'm wondering is why we need to take sides on this," says student @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "After all, it's only a theory. An unproven theory. Technically. It's not like it has any bearing on real life - let's just allow the biologists to teach evolution but emphasise that it's only a theory, but also make them teach other theories such as creationism. Heck, we can tell them that crackpot theory that we're all descended from @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ too! Then everyone goes away happy."

4. "Stop bickering already!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Minister of Education. "I say that you can have your cake and eat it, too. Education should be split if it stops this debate.

[b][anchor=147]#147[/anchor]: Military Budgets Up For Approval [Greater Philadelphia; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
The various branches of @@NAME@@'s military brought their budget petitions to your attention and, as usual, they are all asking for widespread increases over the rest of the military departments.

The Debate
1. "Clearly the army requires the greatest increase in funds this year," says Field Marshal @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "After all, wars were never won by air or sea and in this dangerous world we must be able to protect the interests of @@NAME@@. Currently our men get hand-me-down weapons, rations I wouldn't feed a pig - the army is increasingly looking like a bad career option and we can't have that. If we're going to get recruits, we need more funding to support our brave lads in their duty."

2. "Hah! It's the Navy who needs the money, mate," says Grand Admiral @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The army and the police forces can protect us domestically, but can they protect us from having our foreign trade cut off? Can they protect us from terrorists and pirates? How are the soldiers going to get to the enemy's borders? Swim? I think not. Fund us, the Navy, the true protectors of @@NAME@@!"

3. "Despite the statements of my colleagues," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Marshal of the Air Force. "The Air Force requires more money than these men playing around with boats. We are increasingly seeing terrorists taking to the air, and more ships or guns are not going to stop that. Our people will only be safe when the Air Force has the power it needs to defend us - and for that we need more funding and more government support for industries geared towards the development of new aircraft."

4. "You're all thinking too small!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an avid Star Wars fan. "What we need is more research into the possibilities of space weapons! Big laser cannon and satellites with complete annihilation power! And cool spaceships! Boom! Rat-a-tata! Bang! Bang! It'll be expensive, sure, but think of the power! THE POWER!"

5. "It's simply not good enough!" wails @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Minister of Defence. "It's not about the money - it's the manpower. Not enough people by far are signing up! All we seem to be getting nowadays are drunks and people who volunteered for a dare. The current conscription laws need to be either more strictly enforced or drastically rewritten. What I propose is a universal draft: everyone capable of pulling a trigger should become a part of the Army, Navy or Air Force. Only in this way can we ensure the dominance of @@NAME@@ in the region."

6. "The military is a stain on the peace-loving nature of our nation!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while sporting a Rastifarian hat. "People should be allowed to choose what they do for a living! Conscription is wrong and I don't see why our tax @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ should go to such a despicable cause! The money should be going to more important places - like our pockets!"

The Issue
The @@NAME@@ S.P.C.C. has launched a fresh campaign to stop parents from smacking their children. They demand that the government introduce laws to ban this form of 'corporal punishment'.

The Debate
1. Child Psychiatrist, Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, speaks at a press conference on the matter: "Parents and teachers must realise that smacking children increases aggressiveness, lowers their self-esteem, and can cause long-term emotional trauma! How can anybody think that it is anything but child abuse? Parents who resort to smacking their children are obviously unfit to be parents at all! We must ban this horrible practice at once!"

2. "What are these lunatics on about?!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a concerned parent. "Smacking children has been an effective form of punishment since the dawn of mankind! Outlaw it and I guarantee you the next generation will be a disorderly disaster! Children need, nay CRAVE discipline!

The Debate
1. "We need our guns back!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wildly waving a water pistol in the air. "This is an infringement on our personal rights! If someone went and killed a bunch of people with a cricket bat would you ban them too? Sure people will be killed, but that's the price you've gotta pay for freedom! These liberals keep talking about legalising drugs because if we can't control them, we might as well join them. Humbug! I say we should do the same for guns!"

2. "Nonsense!" insists Michelle Mires, while handcuffing herself to your leg. "Guns pose a risk to people's lives! No one should have the freedom to be stupid! Do you realise just how easy it could be for someone to get hold of a gun and just go and kill people? If you allow everyone to have guns, you're going to be condemning people to death! The answer to safety isn't more guns - it's more policemen on the beat, more serious attention brought to gun-smuggling, and banning toy guns and gun-related violence on the television. We've got to get it into people's heads - guns are BAD."

2. "This is outrageous!" cries armchair revolutionary @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The government must maintain the principles of equality and socialism that we fought so hard for, and not sell the country to corrupt and greedy corporations.

3. "Hey, aren't we all being a little extreme about this?" says noted economist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Surely we could just keep the key industries, such as the electricity and water supplies, under government control and lessen the regulations on the others so they could function more independently?

The Debate
1. "This is an outrage!" cries Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The people of @@NAME@@ just don't know how good they have it! Our nation is a gem compared to many others, but if you give an inch they will take a mile. I had to tell officer Benson's wife yesterday that their child will grow up without a father. Do I think public protests should be outlawed? You're damn right I do."

2. "It all happened so fast," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the protesters. "The crowd was just chanting, you know... and then they tear gassed us. I saw one cop, this Mr. Benson, club a teenager right in the face! For what? Speaking his mind! That's when the crowd rushed him. I'm sorry he's dead, but the police think they have a right to do whatever they want - things get out of hand sometimes. I think the police department should keep out of the way when we're protesting - even if things do get... excited."

3. "It's because protests get out of hand sometimes that we need a police presence," argues PC @@RANDOM_NAME@@ eventually after singing the national anthem to you. "Even violent protestors have a right to feel safe on the streets. If that means we have to die to protect the innocent, then that means we have to die.

The Issue
The conservative Northern-based parents group of "Housewives and Convicts for a Safer @@NAME@@" has put forward a memorandum to ban skateboarding in public.

1. "Skateboarding is a menace to pedestrians and road users," says activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Not to mention the astronomical number of skateboarding-related injuries - hundreds of children flood the emergency rooms of @@NAME@@ as a result of skateboarding every year, which is costly to the taxpayers. Keep our streets safe and save a little cash at the same time. Hell, you could make even more money by ticketing those who violate this law."

2. "Ticketing children for getting out of the house and exercising?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a school teacher, in disbelief. "That's outrageous! It's true that skateboarding can be dangerous but so is walking down the stairs! You want to ban that too?! What we should do is pass laws requiring safety equipment for skaters - if we allocate a little bit of the tax payers' money to the cause, we can build a skate park that will keep our children safe and away from others on the road too."

3. "Yo, dude, I've got a better idea," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while executing a complicated 360° spin over your head. "What if skateboarding was the only way to get around? Wouldn't that be cool?

@@NAME@@'s industries have an ever-growing amount of toxic wastes to dispose of, and doing so in safe ways is becoming prohibitively expensive, leading a group of lobbyists to try and pressure the government into changing existing disposal laws.

The Debate
1. "These waste dumping laws are destroying our businesses!" rants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the @@NAME@@ Bigger Business Bureau. "We need cheaper ways to eliminate industrial by-products, which really aren't as harmful as people think, such as pouring them into rivers or deep ocean ravines where they're harmless to us. Let's remember that the products we manufacture make your life easier and more fun!"

2. "A better way to deal with this problem is to convince the public it isn't a problem at all," whispers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of Scamcorp, an industrial think tank. "Fudge some research, declare that the chemical by-products from industrial processing and production actually make one's teeth and bones healthier.

A haggard group of new recruits in @@NAME@@'s army have spoken out against the brutal conditions experienced in their military training.

The Debate
1. "It's atrocious!" wails Private @@RANDOM_NAME@@, from amidst the cacophony of a parade cadence. "We're forced to sleep in crowded barracks, on hard cots, and do the most inhumane exercises when we wake up! Just today I've had to crawl through a muddy minefield, climb a grease-coated wall, and to top it all off, get mangled by an angry drill sergeant! All we want is a little respect from the officers - maybe to sleep in until noon, and not have to get all sweaty and tired doing stupid things like marching and climbing ropes. Oh, and private bedrooms too - we're risking our lives for the country, after all."

2. "THEY WANT WHAT?!" screams Sgt. Burkz, while pressing back a rising vein on her neck. "This is WAR, not DAYCARE! If anything, the training standards should be tougher! If I want to whip some pasty-faced, beer-gutted greenhorn because he can't climb over a razor-wire fence then I should be be given the permission to do so right away! The cry-babies won't like it, but they can run home back to their rich daddies if that's the way they're having it. War isn't a walk in the park, and training shouldn't be either. For all our sakes."

3. "Training, what a load of old hooey," says renowned spendophobe and radio announcer, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The only thing it teaches our soldiers is how to shine boots and fight plastic dummies.

4. "There is another way, you know..." whispers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Chief of Secret Projects and Shiny Things in @@NAME@@'s military research department. "What if we started taking children and raising them from birth to fight? We'd be able to make them completely immune to propaganda, psychological warfare, and demoralisation.

The Issue
After the vast fortunes of a recently deceased oil tycoon in @@NAME@@ were left to a small cactus plant, citizens nationwide have been asking the same question: should the inheritance tax laws be changed?

The Debate
1. "Every time I see a stupid rich kid having an easy ride of life with money they did nothing to deserve, I go into a jealous rage and start punching walls," says economically disadvantaged individual @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Abolish inheritance entirely! If the government takes the inheritance then we can spend all that cash on things that make ordinary people's lives better, like education, social welfare, and attack helicopters."

2. "This is a disgusting breach of my human rights," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, heir to an international widget empire. "Just think of all the poor families who have spent their lives scrimping and saving with the dream of passing on a modest luxury yacht to ensure the security of their children's children. All that sacrifice, all that toil, all those long nights working their fingers to the bone setting up offshore accounts - it brings a tear to my eye. Inheritance tax has got to go!"

3. "Surely we can arrange some sort of compromise here," says comfortable knitwear fan @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Yes, it's true that some people exploit the system - but a lot of people rely on inheritance for their basic support! Why don't we just set a sensible ceiling on how much you can inherit? That way you get to keep the family farm, but not the five mansions and the oil refinery."

Scientists and animal rights activists have once again brought up the debate over animal experimentation to your attention.

The Debate
1. "What have those poor, defenceless animals ever done to us?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of the East @@NAME@@ @@ANIMAL@@ Sanctuary. "Kidnapping these helpless creatures from their habitat simply to stick probes and needles in them is just barbaric! How would you like it if someone caged you in a lab and conducted tests on you just to find out whether a new product was fit for sale? Experimenting on animals ought to be banned!"

2. "It is not unethical," replies Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the chief surgeon at @@NAME@@'s largest Cancer Research Clinic. "The unethical thing to do would be to deny the public of the benefit of the great scientific advancements we're making! If we have to sacrifice some animals in the name of science, healthcare, or a commercial venture, then that's just what we've got to do! Think of the lives we could save! All we require is more government support and funding for this worthy cause."

The Issue
After the Parliament of @@NAME@@ recently passed a controversial law that polls have shown to be very unpopular with the public, a group of concerned citizens has called for mandatory referenda for all laws passed before the state.

The Debate
1. "We want real democracy, and we want it now!" proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spokesperson for special interest group 'Direct Democracy Now!' "The fact that this latest law went through has proven that voting for a Parliament every four years is obviously not enough. Laws must be passed by the masses - that is the only way we can be sure that the will of the people is truly being enforced! We must have mandatory referenda for ALL new laws."

2. "Don't listen to these demagogues!" implores one of your top advisors, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This is a ridiculous and dangerous idea! Referenda are costly and inefficient, and a direct threat to the fine institution that is our Parliament. What do you think we have the Parliament for anyway? Our citizenry nowadays don't know what's good for them. They're too busy milling around at the mall and buying sneakers WITH LIGHTS IN THEM. More control needs to be given to our qualified, intelligent--and most of all INFORMED--politicians."

3. "Referenda are a good idea in principle, but to make them mandatory for each and every law is simply impractical," states Political Scientist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Representative democracy exists because direct democracy would never work in practice in a large society such as @@NAME@@. Just think of all the bureaucracy and expense that would go into it! I suggest that referenda be allowed, but only if at least a third of voters sign a petition requesting one. That should be a nice balance between democracy and practicality."

[b][anchor=164]#164[/anchor]: Licence To Breed? [Kazcaper; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
Increasing reports of child abuse and neglect in @@NAME@@ has prompted local pressure groups to call for 'parental licences'.

The Debate
1. "You need a licence to keep @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ or drive a car," points out local current affairs commentator, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "So why should just any random idiot get to be a mother or father? It just doesn't make sense! If all potential parents had to pass tests to prove they're responsible enough, I'm sure you'd find that it would help decrease the level of child abuse, and increase proper discipline in the home."

2. "This is madness!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You can't deny perfectly good people the right to bring life into this world! @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ manage it easily enough, and you can't tell me they've got more responsibility than your average upstanding citizen of @@NAME@@! The government should keep out of such matters - I've always said social workers and welfare was a drain on the budget. Yes, there will be some sad cases of neglect, but shouldn't we be giving parents the benefit of the doubt?"

3. "The answer to this problem is patently obvious," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your minister of Social Welfare. "The government simply needs to give more funding to the welfare department so that we can recruit more social workers to carry out regular checks on parents and judge whether or not they're doing a good job of looking after their children. It'll be expensive, but at least it's a damn sight fairer than licensing parents."

The Issue
After a recent article in [i]Salutations![/i] magazine highlighted a growing trend in arranged marriages throughout @@NAME@@, several civil rights protesters have camped outside your parliament demanding changes to the law.

The Debate
1. "This can't go on!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a long time campaigner for the rights of single young women. "Right now there's nothing to stop my parents marrying me off to anyone they please! Surely it ought to be the sole decision of the individual as to who they spend the rest of their life with? You can't just force two people together and expect it to work! Arranged marriages must be banned!"

2. "I only want what's best for my daughter," argues Cyril Duckworth, father of three. "She's young! Far too young to know what's good for her! Everyday when I look in the newspaper I learn of another unwanted teen pregnancy, of poor, sad adolescents who have gone down the slippery slope of drugs and violence. If parents have the power to arrange marriages with other, respectable, wealthy families, then it helps set the foundations for our children to have a decent life! I propose that all marriages should be arranged by the parents of the families - it's the best way."

3. "That's crazy!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Domestic Affairs. "Everyone knows that the people who screw your life up most are your parents! And now you consider letting them to decide who you marry?! I think we, the government, should arrange all marriages by national census. Distribute everyone to a place and person in an economically stimulating way - why, we'd solve the housing problems just like that! Especially if we dismiss outmoded things like divorce and monogamy! This could be a golden opportunity for us."

The Issue
A loose coalition of political activists running the gamut of the political spectrum has started a petition to add 'None of the Above' as an option on every ballot, so that a voter can reject all candidates if he feels none of them represent a viable option. If 'None of the Above' wins the election, a new election with all-new candidates would have to be held.

The Debate
1. "It's a simple matter really," says left-wing activist and former rock star @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Sometimes when you're voting, all the options suck. Why then should people be forced to hold their nose and vote for the lesser of two, or even three or four evils? Adding 'None of the Above' to the ballot would ensure that the people have a choice at all times, even if that choice is to reject the choices they have been given!"

2. "Adding 'None of the Above' to the ballot makes absolutely no sense," contributes conservative political pundit @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Those who want to run for office have already put their names on the ballot, and if none of those options suits the voter, that's just too bad. Instead, we ought to prevent this sort of problem and limit the number of options. Sure, fewer people can run, but that will eliminate costly runoff elections completely!"

The Issue
Recent reports revealing that the dental health of @@NAME@@ is far below the regional average have ignited a fierce debate over whether to introduce fluoride to the nation's tap water reserves.

The Debate
1. "Fluoride has been shown time and time again to promote dental health," argues Dr. Edwin Namel, Chairperson of 'Friends of The Teeth'. "It's not an experimental drug for heaven's sake, it's an accepted method of promoting national good health. A nationwide program for the fluoridation of drinking water should not be seen as optional - it's a no-brainer for any sensible government. We need to implement this now, whether the public want it or not."

*2. "I am strongly against this proposal!" rages @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the more vociferous members of the @@NAME@@ Green Society. "When I turn on the water tap I expect to get just that. Water. Nothing else. We are not lab rats and it is not the government's place to force us into taking these chemicals!

[[color=red]Drugs are being dumped into the water supply[/color]]

4. "There's no need to go to either extreme," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your personal dentist. "It's all about, um, choice. Here's a nice alternative: why not just have clean non-fluoridated drinking water and give more funds to dentists? If we had enough money, we could make all dental care absolutely free!

The Issue
A medical report has detailed a twenty-fold increase in infection rates over the past ten years of the sexually transmitted disease VODAIS (Viral Overactive Dysfunction of the Auto-Immune System). People all over the nation are petitioning that the government do something about the epidemic.

The Debate
1. "This situation is about to explode. At this rate, this epidemic could severely impact our economy, our way of life, and even our government," says Doctor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We must supply powerful drugs to all infected people, even if we have to produce and distribute it ourselves. We must also educate people on the dangers of VODAIS and supply condoms to all sexually active males. Sure, we'll need to divert tax money from the military to fund all this, but what good is a military if the soldiers are too sick to fight?"

2. "If you supply condoms, you'll increase sexual promiscuity," scoffs religious leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If you supply drugs, you'll risk creating an aura of invincibility which in turn increases sexual promiscuity. Sexual abstinence is 100% effective in preventing VODAIS infection. This knowledge must be taught at all schools and workplaces, and all other choices must be ridiculed. Make celibacy the only option!"

3. "Supplying drugs and condoms will not stop VODAIS infections and forcing everyone to be celibate will be the slow death of @@NAME@@," whispers Health Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in a poorly-lit back room. "Segregating the infected people is the most effective method. Everybody in @@NAME@@ must be tested for VODAIS.

The Issue
The fierce debate on @@ANIMAL@@ hunting in @@NAME@@ has been brought to your attention after vociferous supporters of both sides of the argument stormed your parliament.

The Debate
1. "@@ANIMAL@@ hunting is a cruel and horrible 'sport' for the wealthy," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the 'Protect Anything Cute and Furry Society'. "How can you possibly justify it? Oh, they witter on about 'tradition' and 'pest control' and other such nonsense, but really we all know it's because these sadists love to torture poor, innocent animals! Hunting must be banned!"

2. "Banning @@ANIMAL@@ hunting would be the end for centuries of tradition!" wails esteemed aristocrat @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from atop his steed. "The thrill of the chase, the baying of the hounds, the @@ANIMAL@@ scooting through the undergrowth - it would be a travesty! We provide much needed stimulus to the local tourism, and you can't deny that @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ are pests - killing farmers' livestock for example! I propose that @@ANIMAL@@ hunting be encouraged, for the cultural - and economic - benefit of the nation!"

3. "Well, you know what I think?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while helping to assemble a small trebuchet. "I reckon that the real issue about this sport is the cruelty aspect, and no-one can deny that sending a pack of dogs to tear apart a poor, innocent @@ANIMAL@@ is cruel. I reckon we should just ban hunting with hounds and only allow kinder and more instantly lethal methods like guns, tranquillisers, and cruise missiles."

4. "I'm firmly against the slaughter of dumb animals," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while feeding an infant @@ANIMAL@@ with a milk bottle. "It would be best if the animals didn't die, and hunters could still do what they love to do - how about instead of shooting them or sending vicious canines after them, the hunter runs up to his quarry and gives it a symbolic 'tap' with his hand?

The Issue
Due to desertification, the transition of habitable land to desert as a result of overcultivation and the increasing degradation of the environment, much of @@NAME@@'s once-green rural areas are turning into barren, rocky deserts.

The Debate
1. "This is a disaster," wails @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of the Environment. "We've been too lax on letting the agriculture sector overgraze and overcrop our lands and now we're paying the price. There needs to be some serious cutback on what these companies are allowed to do, or before you know it we're going to be scaling sand dunes on the way to work."

"We's just goin' t' be tole we're out of a job?

The Debate
1. "These damned hooligans are running wild on our streets!" splutters hard-nosed Sergeant @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the police force. "My overworked officers can't cope anymore! Everywhere we look we're being surrounded by mobs of unruly children! I need you to give me and my officers the power to dish out punishment to these little hoodlums. I don't care how young these kids are - they need to learn to behave properly as soon as possible. Even if it requires a short jail sentence of ten years or so."

2. "The last thing we need is a police force that prosecutes, convicts, AND sentences young kids!" yells outraged Child Welfare Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "These youngsters are merely children being playful! Let them learn from their own mistakes! You can't tell me you weren't ever naughty when you were that young!

Religious professionals and fanatic hermits across @@NAME@@ have been drawing increasingly animated attention to the decreasing levels of church attendance among the population.

The Debate
1. "The apathy of @@NAME@@'s people towards their religious duties to God is abysmal," rumbles a man known only as 'The Hierophant' as he brandishes his holy book at you. "If we don't rectify this problem immediately the ground shalt quake, the sky shalt turn blood-red, and the fields shalt turn to offal. The government must make religious attendance compulsory before all the land is damned to an eternity in the Netherworld!"

2. "Compulsory church attendance is not the answer to this problem," says Swami @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in between spells of meditation. "There are many ways to enlightenment and it would be wrong for the government to enforce any one of them so, instead, we must divert some of the money we spend on meaningless economic pursuits into funding an awareness campaign to help people discover their true religious identity. We must establish temples, mosques, and hermitages so people can find out which path to their spirituality is right for them."

3. "I reckon you could just ignore these zealots and scrap any government funding we still have going into religion," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, author of the wildly unpopular book 'Face It, There Is No Afterlife'. "I can't believe that modern thinkers like you and me are still tying ourselves down with outmoded and outdated concepts like the 'soul' or 'God'.

The Debate
1. "The government must put a stop to businesses discriminating against women when they apply for a job!" chants @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a ferocious supporter of women's rights. "Did you know that on average men in @@NAME@@ earn substantially more than women for doing the same job? For too long has the female race been discriminated against in our society due to their sex! We demand equal wages, equal opportunities, and equal respect for women, and we demand them now!"

2. "Hey, my business is treading a thin enough profit margin as it is," complains @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, CEO of Heavy Lifting Incorporated. "Women just aren't as good as men at certain jobs, it's a probably proven fact! Take firefighting - if you were dying from smoke inhalation and collapsed on the floor unable to move, who would you prefer to attempt to rescue you? A man with superior muscular strength or some weakling female? Go on, you decide. Let the businesses decide what they pay and who they pay it to - after all, the economy depends on us."

3. "Hah! Our society is getting far too soft!" rages @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a staunch male chauvinist. "Whatever happened to the days when a man could go back home to find his good lady wife with his tea ready and his slippers warm? I've heard that some men even have to cook and clean for themselves! We should be actively encouraging women to stay where they belong by making it expected that women get paid half what men do for the same job. After all, their poor brains are prone to overheating, so they're naturally less efficient in the workplace."

4. "Personally I think things went wrong as soon as women got labelled as the 'fairer' sex," interrupts Catherine Gratwick, author of the best-selling novel 'Gynaecocracy For Beginners'. "We're strong, we're willing - and we're just plain better than men. See what a state the world is in when they're in charge?

3. "You know that no matter what we decide we're going to make people mad," points out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Public Relations. "But the best way to control public opinion is to tell the public what their opinions are. I suggest nationalising all the newspapers and putting them under government control.

At least we won't have to issue ANOTHER public statement to tell everyone you're not a hyper-intelligent aubergine."

Tens of thousands of @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ all over @@NAME@@ have been found to have contracted the fatal and highly contagious Mad @@ANIMAL@@ Disease, destroying livestock and causing widespread panic after evidence that the disease is transmissible to your citizens was released.

Recent technological developments in mobile phones are raising concerns from your citizens about the possible harm they are doing to the modern generation.

The Debate
1. "Everyone is just staring at their phone screens these days!" messages anti-mobile lobbyist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, via the WotsOn chat service. "Between social media, augmented reality games and personal assistant software, people now spend more time looking at and talking to their phones than they do interacting with real people!

The Issue
The 'Underground Element', a newly formed resistance force to the governing party in @@NAME@@, has begun broadcasting anti-government messages over a network of public radio stations.

The Debate
1. "These rebels are harmless," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, political commentator. "In the interests of free speech and democracy, we should allow them to broadcast their messages. There's nothing wrong with a little criticism of the government - indeed, it could do with some more incentive to perform well."

The Debate
1. "It's their future as well, let the youngsters have their say!" calls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a retired history teacher. "By their early-teens, they should know as much about our government and political process as any other voter. It's time we got some young blood infused into the political process and got people interested in politics again."

2. "Are you mad?" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, government treasurer. "Teenagers are way too easily distracted! They'll end up making snap decisions and lumber us with some incompetent fool who reduces our economy to ruin and could even end up giving out tax cuts! If anything, the government needs to be more careful about who we allow to vote. Background checks and strict conditions placed on all voters should help keep our government running smoothly."

"It's more like being able to have a dozen abortions per month until you get the foetus you desire.

"For too long now the government has been snatching away our children and training them to become killing machines. This archaic practice must be banned at once! Sure, some of them could end up breaking into cars or terrorising old people, but hey, kids will be kids, right?"

The Issue
Crowds of angrily sober sports fans and university students have petitioned the government to repeal the prohibition of alcohol.

The Debate
1. "Banning alcohol was the worst government decision ever made," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former connoisseur of fine wines. "One can only drink grape juice for so long before one gets most awfully tired of it! Our society needs alcohol: it reduces inhibitions, dulls the pains of our modern existence and lets us all have a good time. Yes there are those who abuse it, but that's their choice.

2. "It's certainly not the choice of the victims of drink-driving!" retorts police chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Or the families torn apart by alcoholism! Banning it caused huge drops in violence, vehicle accidents and medical costs. How could any sane person want to re-legalise that poison?

3. "In large amounts alcohol is damaging, but moderate amounts can actually be quite beneficial," says Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Like many other potentially harmful drugs, alcohol should be available on prescription.

*2. "More police isn't the answer," retorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of research at @@NAME@@'s largest car manufacturer. "This is a job for the private sector!

1. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of consumer watchdog 'Debt-Busters' urges the government to enact new laws: "We've got middle and lower class families falling victim to predatory financial institutions and plunging into debts they can never hope to repay.

The Issue
Recently, there has been an enormous commercial success for 'violent' video games such as 'Blood 'n' Guts 2: The Revenge', 'Tremor', and 'Grand Theft Tricycle'. Several parents' groups have been calling for tougher restrictions on these games.

The Debate
1. "We must outlaw these violent games immediately!" shouts Catherine Gratwick, a member of Mothers Ordered Against Nastiness, "These so-called 'games' are desensitising our children to violence and making them more aggressive. Why, just the other day I witnessed my son firing a missile launcher in a videogame and the next day he went out and robbed a bank! He may be thirty-five, but you can't possibly say it's a coincidence!"

2. "Oh noez!" cries DEATMASTER_69, one of @@NAME@@'s foremost authorities on video games. "That's stupid! If a child is psychotic, it's not because they played 'Hellstorm of Fireblood 3' or whatever, it's because their parents were stupid enough to not teach little Johnny the difference between right and wrong and don't want to take the blame. Just because I like to n00k countries in games doesn't mean I like to shoot people in real life. That's false data! So just relax and let the kids play their games, hey?"

3. "Why not rate games the same way we rate movies?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a spokesperson for the @@NAME@@ Censorship Board. "We could give each game a content rating based on age appropriateness, and add descriptors on the box explaining why the game gets a certain rating. A little funding and we can stop children getting violent video games without affecting all the older 'gamers'. Everyone will be happy. Except tax payers, I guess."

4. "The children will manage to get their hands on the games anyway," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a fitness instructor. "Parents can be so ignorant. In my opinion, the only damage these video games are causing is physical: kids are becoming less inclined to exercise, and it doesn't really matter if they are violent; the result is the same either way.

We cannot permit people to slander and mock our prophet and insult all of us. These people are simply doing this to see if we are extremists. Death to the blasphemers!"

2. Speaking anonymously and from hiding, one of the musicians says, "It was just meant to be a joke! I never thought that they'd take it so seriously.

The Issue
A young mother was recently thrown out of a restaurant in @@NAME@@ for publicly breastfeeding her baby and 'upsetting the customers'. There are now demands for the government to state their position on the issue.

The Debate
1. "We should have a perfect right to feed our babies where we want and when we want without fear of harassment from anyone," declares Catherine Gratwick, a likewise young mother. "Why should women hide themselves away just to assuage the silly attitudes of these narrow-minded fogies? It's totally natural, and much healthier than bottle-feeding for both mother and child so why the fuss? Today, women are afraid to breastfeed in public and the law should be on their side - if not for their benefit, then for that of the children."

2. "I think it's just wrong, wrong, wrong," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, in reply to an online survey. "These women should cover themselves up and feed their kids away from sight like respectable folk. It's not like bottles don't exist! I don't want to have to look at that sort of thing when I'm having a romantic dinner or going on a nice leisurely walk down the street, you know. It should be a private thing, like other bodily functions that I rather care not to mention."

3. "I'm not against mothers breastfeeding in public," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a manager of human resources. "But what I find objectionable is that women could be allowed to breastfeed at the workplace when they should be doing more productive things like, well, working.

The Issue
After a much-publicised incident involving a farmer's attempts to drive a family of travellers off private property, there has been a call for you to review the laws governing nomadic communities and their mobile homes.

The Debate
1. "These turnpike travellers just rolled onto my field in those caravans of theirs and camped out," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the enraged farmer. "And when I tries to run 'em over with my tractor, it's me who gets stuck in the cells overnight! I've tried getting the government to evict them but they take too long over it. How would these people have reacted if I'd set up a tent in their back garden? There should be a law so I can get rid of them any way I choose. Vagrants should not be allowed to go wherever they like. It's just not fair to landowners."

2. "All we wanted was a place to stay the night," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a traveller and parent of fourteen children. "Or maybe for a week or so. Or a month. Perhaps through winter; it's pretty mild around here, I don't know. But is that such a crime? We weren't stealing anything, or harming anyone. All we ask is to be allowed to continue our travels without harassment."

3. "I don't think that's a good idea," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your advisors who happens to own an extensive greenfield site. "We can't just let people go living wherever they like just because they've been doing it for hundreds of years. It's very untidy! What I suggest is that we dip into the coffers and buy plots of land, all over the country, and turn them into nice safe areas where these folks can stay for as long as they want before they decide to move on. See? Problem solved."

4. "I have the best solution," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, in response to a street survey. "These itinerants should be arrested, their caravans sold for scrap, and, and... told not to do it again! I think we've all had enough with the government pussy-footing their way around these criminals! The way they just swan in and disrupt communities any way they please!

"My own son learned about something called 'homosexuality' the other day! For shame! We all know it should be Adam and Eve, not Adam and... Geoff? Anyway, my point is that sex education should be dropped from schools and instead taught by parents the way they see fit. That way children will get consistent messages and parents, not society, will cop the blame if any of their kids fall pregnant."

6. "No-one's asked me my opinion yet," says teenage mother Catherine Gratwick, as she bottle-feeds her baby. "I think it's perfectly obvious what the cause of teenage pregnancy is - teenage boys! My son's father is the one that got me into this mess. He's the one who pressured me into having sex, but all the education is focused on the girls. Teenage fathers should be made responsible for their actions for once and be made to join the military so they can send their wages back to pay for their children's upkeep. If that's not a deterrent, then I don't know what is."

7. "I think we've missed the fact that maybe this teenage pregnancy phenomenon is not such a bad thing," says famous demographer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We need the population to grow, we need more men of working age, we need more folk to pay taxes, et cetera. There are plenty of sound demographic reasons why we should be encouraging women to have families as soon as they can.

After years of costly military build-up, the military now has a state of readiness capable of responding to all threats, both foreign and domestic. There is extensive debate among government officials, the military, and the average citizen over what, if anything, should be done with this powerful asset.

The Debate
1. "No one even thinks to look at us funny now," says Field Marshall Lionel Mandrake as he taps a swagger stick against his hip. "So think about how they'd act when the military is in proper charge of the country? We'd say jump, and they'd jump, by jingo. Oh, and if you don't agree with me, consider this a coup."

2. "There's no point in having a military this size when our closest adversary has a water pistol strapped to a scooter and calls it an armoured brigade," says noted economist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Besides, the military's been getting uppity with all its funding anyway.

The Debate
1. "Children like this are in desperate need of food," says Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@ gesturing to a twelve-year-old starveling who is four foot tall and weighs twenty kilograms. "Yet every day I see big, fat tourists with their spoilt, asthmatic children. I'm sick of living on the wrong side of global capitalism. We must decentralise and localise the national economy by dismantling all cash-crop farms and give them to subsistence farmers to grow food crops. Everything must be nationalised so profits will flow into @@NAME@@ and not foreign shareholders. This will revitalise our economy on a subsistence level and bring everyone to an equal standing. Extreme, some might say, but who cares about these things when our children are going to bed, if they have a bed, hungry?"

2. "What? No! You can't! If we kick out foreign investors and corporations, then trade with other countries will grind to a halt," splutters Treasurer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What I propose are Free Trade Agreements with richer countries. We can give rich countries complete access to our entire infrastructure sectors and natural and mineral resources in return for a reliable supply of food aid and other cheap imports.

"What's the point of giving them aid if they continue to breed? All social, welfare and food aid benefits are a total waste of money.

"There is a way to deal with this problem without giving foreigners complete control over our economy!

New laws must be made and the people responsible for allowing this to happen brought to justice."

*2. "These allegations are ludicrous and unfounded," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of the South @@NAME@@ Mining Company. "We use the finest twigs to build our mines and the last thing we need is the government tying us down with yet more rules.

[b][anchor=209]#209[/anchor]: Students Demand Financial Aid [Rajlworld; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
Students from many universities in @@NAME@@ are protesting about the rising financial cost of studying at university and are demanding that the government provide more financial aid to students.

The Debate
1. "We need money now," screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a student from one of @@NAME@@'s top achieving universities. "All these tuition fees are just too much! I need that money to spend on books, study materials, accomodation, and alco- well, uh, you get the gist of it. All these fees are doing is preventing people from poorer backgrounds achieving their potential. The government ought to pay for all university expenses. After all if nobody went to university where would all the doctors and teachers come from?"

2. "OH GOD NO THE EXPENSE!" screeches @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your minister of Education before eventually calming down. "No, no. This is not a good idea. Do you know how high the tax rate is already without introducing something like this? We should be making tuition fees higher if anything. University is a privilege, not a right, and only the elite should be allowed within those walls. And by elite, of course, I mean rich."

3. "These young people are the greatest resource our nation has," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a famous demographer. "If you're going to discourage them from going to university then you're cheating our nation out of its potential. What I suggest is government-funded loans to students from poor families. That way we can have the best of both worlds without the expense. Admittedly, some may still not be able to afford it but there's no pleasing some people."

4. "Why bother with universities anyway," says refuse collector @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "These students could be working and earning a living instead of wasting time and money learning things with no point whatsoever. Who needs to know about ancient Maxtopian poetry, huh? Who would hire you for that? There are plenty of jobs out there, so why don't they go and get one? I'll tell you why: it's because they are lazy. I propose the government close all universities in @@NAME@@ and make people get a job after they leave school. With all the money saved from closing down universities we can have a well-deserved tax cut too."

The Issue
It has come to your attention that there is some serious debate over whether @@NAME@@'s postal service should be either privatised or nationalised.

The Debate
1. "The postal system ought to be privatised," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Director of PostHaste, a small package delivery company. "All the government is doing is putting the tax @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ of hard-working citizens into an outmoded and wasteful system. Private businesses can offer a much more efficient system with less junk mail. A little more expense on stamps is worth that right?"

2. "Uh huh? And what about those in rural or remote areas?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of @@NAME@@ Mail, the government-owned postal service. "If you privatise this business then they'll get marginalised and ignored. With a nationalised service everyone can use the system and cheaply too. We provide a good service for our customers and have been doing so for a very long time! The postal service should be nationalised and all competition banned!"

3. "There's plenty of room for compromise," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a stamp collector. "How about we just privatise the mail system and allow other competitors to move in but continue with government funding to @@NAME@@ Mail? That way everyone can get their post and the companies can have their own slice of the pie. It'll require an increase in tax to cope with losses to competition but not too much. I think. To be frank, I just want more stamps."

The Issue
A collection of citizens, civil rights workers, and concerned mothers have signed a petition to stop the manufacturing of the 'BFG-69' (AKA 'the Organ Grinder'), a new rifle planned to be used in the military which works by shredding people's internal organs.

The Debate
1. "Excuse me, but whenever has anyone ever heard of a weapon that WAS humane?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, ballistics expert. "These are devices for firing slugs of metal at people. It's not nice, but it IS necessary. People are always so squeamish. They've already accepted the standard ripping through the body of the standard bullet but the moment something a little more effective is made they kick up a fuss. Typical. These nonstandard weapons should only be put into trained military hands anyway. We're not making rocking horses here, we're protecting @@NAME@@ against her enemies! Just this once, let's try to stay ahead of them."

"These weapons are the future and it won't just stop with the BFG-69. We're planning on introducing the Bone-Breaker @@POPULATION_VALUE@@-DX Sonic Rocket Launcher next year along with our anthrax grenade line.

We'd also like to sell it commercially to your police force and citizens if you'd just sign here...?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3. "No! This rifle is completely inhumane," says Dr @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leaning on a cane. "These weapons are unnecessarily violent - how can anyone condone something that rips apart your innards like this? How long do you think it will be before these new inventions get into the wrong hands? Shootings are bad enough but at least most people are just wounded. The BFG-69 and those of its ilk are lethal in the extreme and are completely unacceptable! We need some moral decency here and get rid of these unconventional weapons along with all the other shameful armaments like mustard gas."

[b][anchor=212]#212[/anchor]: Police Wanting Help With Their Inquiries [Prasland; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
After delayed DNA evidence put a notorious rapist behind bars the police have demanded that it be mandatory for those accused of a crime to surrender blood and tissue samples to aid the elimination process.

The Debate
1. "I'm surprised this hasn't been brought up sooner," says Chief Constable @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If we have DNA samples of all the accused it will make solving crimes like rape and murder that much faster! Sure, some people will think it's a tad invasive, but in my experience if you're worried by something like giving up a few drops of the red stuff then you've probably got something to hide."

2. "This is a breach of privacy in every meaning of the word!" criminal defence attorney @@RANDOM_NAME@@ exclaims. "Or three words, but this is an outrage! It's these peoples' bodies, not the government's nor the police's. If they want to give a DNA sample it should be THEIR decision! Now I'll admit there have been times when DNA sampling has helped solve a case or two but shouldn't we be upholding the inherent right of every man and woman to have their body remain unmolested unless they should so choose it? Undoubtedly! DNA sampling should only take place with the person's informed consent."

3. "What about the victims of these crimes?" asks DI @@RANDOM_NAME@@, ever gruff and stalwart in the face of adversity. "Do they not have rights? Their right to privacy's been violated so it ought to be the responsibility of the criminal to give up his own. What I propose is the collection of DNA samples from every citizen in @@NAME@@ so we can track down the culprit if none of our suspects come up with anything. It'll be expensive, sure, there's @@POPULATION@@ people to go through... but it's just a small blood sample. Don't you think it's worth it?"

The Issue
After several tragic bus accidents across @@NAME@@, bus drivers have started a strike until safety standards have been raised.

The Debate
1. "Every morning I step into that thing I wonder when it's finally going to fall to bits," grumbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a bus driver. "The lights don't work, half of the seats are either vandalised or missing, the top deck smells like something died there, and something HAS died right at the back.

5. "Now now now, there's no need to be quite so gung-ho," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a city planner. "The public transport system is vital for cutting down congestion and pollution within urban areas.

[b][anchor=214]#214[/anchor]: Voting For More Money [Not Quite Dead Peoples; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
It has long been traditional in @@NAME@@ for Members of Parliament to set their own salary. This has, however, led to a recent vote in which members unanimously tripled their pay. Watchdog groups have spoken out against this.

The Debate
1. "Oh, wouldn't the world be a happier place if we could all decide our wages," shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leader of the World Of Watchdog, an anti-corruption foundation. "Who in their right minds would vote against getting more money with no strings attached? This quite obviously cannot be allowed to continue or where will it end? That money should be being used to fund hospitals, not personal luxuries! Well enough is enough! Politicians' salaries should be set by public vote! Maybe then we'll see something more reasonable!"

2. "I couldn't agree less," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Member of Parliament. "Sure, some people might think that having eight cars and three secretaries is excessive, but I'm doing our country a valuable service. Probably one of the most important services there is: representing the people and deciding what course our country should take. It's an incredibly stressful job and there's no way we could do it with lower pay. Members of Parliament ought to be allowed anything they want in return for all they do for @@NAME@@. If we have what we want we're less likely to take bribes too."

3. "Perhaps there's a way to compromise," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an amateur economist, philosopher and lepidopterist. "The problem here is that politicians could either be paid too little or too much. What if we paid them just right by paying them according to how well they do their job? Keep a close monitor on the needs of their constituencies and give bonuses for resolving problems and coming under budget. It gives them a proper monetary incentive to do their jobs. Some will have a harder time than others and the whole idea may be costly but if it cracks down on corruption I'm all for it."

The Issue
During a national press conference, a little girl with ribbons in her hair asks you what your favourite colour is. Your panicked advisors have frantically called an emergency conference to come up with possible answers.

The Debate
1. "Tell her it's red," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sharing out the meeting's doughnut tray. "It'll show them that our nation has nowt to do with money grabbing capitalists."

2. "Tell her it's blue," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who inexplicably appears to be sitting in a tin bath and playing with a rubber duck. "Blue like the open ocean - it will show our devotion to all things marine. Quack."

3. "Tell her it's yellow," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, embracing you warmly and giving you a soppy kiss. "It is such a shining, bright, happy colour. It will fill your citizens with such joy to hear it is your favourite."

4. "Tell her it's green," advises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while caressing what appears to be a cabbage. "It'll draw attention to your benevolent environmental policy!"

5. "Tell her it's orange," advises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, running a lap around the conference room. "Such a vibrant colour I've always felt! I'm sure if officially approved it will put some vim and vigour in the people!"

6. "Tell her it's purple," advises Roger Jefferson, relishing his own gourmet doughnut sprinkled with shredded truffles. "It speaks of the finer things in life, of luxury, and shows you as a man of distinction. Not like the riff-raff you see around these days..."

7. "Tell her it's pink," advises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your premier expert on all things gay. "It will send a message that we here in @@NAME@@ are not prejudiced against homosexuals and accept them with open arms."

8. "Tell her it's gold," advises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hands rubbing together in avaricious delight. "Give the people a hint that you'll be focusing on the economy!"

9. "Tell her it's black," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, ripping up pictures of kittens and scowling. "Black like the eternal emptiness of our withered, stilted, and twisted souls."

10. "Tell her it's white," advises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, reclining in the lotus position. "It is a pure, peaceful colour, befitting the moral stance your government should embrace!"

11. "Tell her it's grey," advises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is decidedly nondescript. "It's nice and neutral, won't upset anyone. Speaks of proper military bearing and protocol. People will like that."

12. "Tell her you don't have a favourite colour," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the president of Open Our Perimeters Straightaway, on walking in. "@@NAME@@ is a modern country that does not discriminate between colours. We should allow everyone whether they be Bigtopian, Lilliputian, or Maxtopian into our bountiful nation."

[b][anchor=216]#216[/anchor]: Eminent Domain: Inherent Right Or Daylight Robbery? [British Londinium; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
A furious debate over eminent domain, or compulsory purchase, the government's right to take a citizen's private property without permission, has erupted after the government evicted hundreds of people from their homes to make way for a new shopping complex and a bypass.

The Debate
1. "Eminent Domain? More like outright theft!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose house was bulldozed. "They took away my home! I have to move everything in my life somewhere else because of the whims of some fruitcake city planner? It's lunacy! This blatant power abuse mustn't be allowed to continue. The government should require explicit permission before taking private property!"

2. "You can't be serious," objects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a city planner. "You've got to have bypasses. Eminent domain's essential! Without it we'd actually have to pay for the property we were steali- ah- expropriating and that would mean lots of boring paperwork and be much more expensive. If we really need to build something, say a bypass to ease congestion, do you really want that to be stopped because one person says no? We need eminent domain to let @@NAME@@ make progress. In fact we could cut costs even more if we didn't have to pay compensation..."

3. "I do believe we should retain our right to eminent domain," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Miscellaneous Amenities. "But to use it for private industry is just immoral and corrupting. We really ought to only use eminent domain for the purpose of building public utilities like hospitals, schools, and carparks."

[b][anchor=217]#217[/anchor]: Healthcare Services Underfunded, Claim Patients [Lunar Village; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
The @@NAME_INITIALS@@NHS (@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ National Health Service) is struggling to pay for the medicinal and surgical treatments required for your citizens.

The Debate
1. "The NHS was an ill thought-out idea to begin with!" exclaims conservative aristocrat @@RANDOM_NAME@@ IV. "We were much better off in a time when the medical profession was geared towards those who could pay for their treatment. Nowadays the waiting lists are choked with riff-raff of all kinds. I don't see why I should pay for someone else's healthcare. Those of us who can afford to pay for a private doctor ought to be allowed to opt out of the NHS tax and if that means lower quality of service for the masses then tough!"

2. "A sickeningly predictable view from the toffs there", retorts senior nurse @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Being diagnosed with an illness is stressful enough without adding a huge financial burden to the equation. Do you honestly believe people should be denied treatment just because they're poor? The NHS works; people are living longer and fuller lives. I don't have any problem with contributing to the health of @@NAME@@'s citizens. We should increase NHS tax."

3. "Naaaah," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your personal fitness instructor. "The problem is that we are trying to treat all citizens equally. There is no incentive to live a healthy lifestyle. If people had to pay a rate of NHS tax based on such factors as nicotine and alcohol intake, exercise routine and diet then the sensible thing to do would be to take responsibility for one's own health. The more unhealthy you are, the more you must contribute in tax. We'd have national surveys to make sure no one cheats which would be expensive - but fair. Now give me twenty push-ups."

4. "A nice idea but unworkable", muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, another of @@NAME@@'s seemingly ubiquitous economists. "How many people do you expect not to lie through their teeth so they don't have to pay so much tax? I would suggest that the problem is that drug companies can develop a drug secure in the knowledge that they can charge what they like and the NHS will be pressured to pay for it. We should force drug companies to surrender their drug to competition after, say, five years and the NHS should then only be allowed to buy drugs which are five years old. This will cut down on the costs considerably while still providing excellent service. Patients may die from technically curable diseases but hey... that's economic reality for you."

5. "The National Health Service was doomed to failure before it even started," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a right-wing political commentator. "Anything powered by the 'goodness of people's hearts' is. I don't give a flying monkey's about people I've never met yet I have to pay money that I earned so they can fix their broken legs or runny noses. What about my broken legs, huh? I call on the government to disband the National Health Service and bring back private health insurance. Those unable to pay should work harder and if they can't work... well screw 'em."

[b][anchor=218]#218[/anchor]: Two Mommies One Too Many? [Duffla; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
The commercial release of the controversial children's book 'Heather Has Two Mommies' in @@NAME@@ has sparked debate over laws concerning the adoption of children by homosexual couples.

The Debate
1. "I cannot understand for the life of me why anyone could possibly be against this," complains Jacob Kantelberg, showing up at your office wearing a pink feather boa. "Bart and I are good and caring people and will make excellent fathers, so what's the problem? All of the scientific studies have shown that there's no difference in the wellbeing of children raised by gay and straight couples. All that's holding these little darlings back from the happy family life that they deserve is the outdated prejudices of some prudes. All we want is to adopt a child to call our own. It'll be fabulous!"

2. "I don't care what these so-called scientific studies say," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, representing a number of conservative religious organisations. "How can a boy hope to develop properly into a man if he's being brought up by poofs? A father figure is not supposed to behave as if it is 'okay' to be, um, romantically invested in another man - and the same goes for lesbians! Why? Because it is not okay. It'll just give them gay! Think about it: say you have two gay @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ - they can't have children because nature did not provide them with the tools and if God wanted gays to have kids then they would have those tools. Don't legalise this blasphemy! Think of the children!"

3. "This just doesn't go far enough in my opinion," grumbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@ an ardent opponent to homosexuality. "The more concessions we give these people, the more they'll reduce our nation to the most embarrassing gayfest of all the region! We'll be a joke! Homosexuality is a sin, and not only that it's a disease of society and there's no two ways about it. It must be criminalised and those responsible hanged just like in the good old days."

Some key figures of @@NAME@@'s major religious groups have requested government sponsorship for the institution of an inquisition to try heretics and blasphemers.

The Debate
1. Cardinal Mortimer Gratwick, Archbishop of @@CAPITAL@@, demands you kiss his ring before telling you, "the Church encourages the formation of an Inquisition. However, it will only be to try those in error and put them on the right track to holiness; you needn't worry about those nasty thumb-screws and we haven't had a rack in ages, so we won't be torturing people. Of course, in order to bring this noble plan into effect, the Holy Office must have jurisdiction over the civil courts."

2. "This is bloody outrageous!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the nation's most important civil liberties movement, People for the Ethical Treatment of Everything, while jumping up and down in front of a television camera. "These damn ultra-conservatives will plunge us all into chaos! @@NAME@@ can never have an Inquisition! Everyone should have the right to think, say, believe, etc, whatever the damn they please.

This is supposed to be a democracy, yet less than a quarter of our population voted for your government!

3. "The easier you make something the less anyone will care about it," says Catriona Wood, a political scientist with nothing to do. "The only real way to increase voter turnout is to force people to vote. Make it compulsory with executions for those who don't comply and then we'll have a true democracy! Sort of."

4. "The reason people aren't voting is because they're quite happy with how things are," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, lounging in a deck chair. "If people can't be bothered to vote then why not just do away with the whole thing altogether? Come the next election, just set yourself up as dictator for life and everyone can get back to whatever they'd rather be doing. Now please go away, you're standing in my rays."

5. "I think you're approaching this the wrong way," says Andrew Lavelle, the proprietor of UltraCorp-SmithMax Chemicals Inc. "If people can't get out and about, it's clearly due to a lack of energy.

The Issue
Over the years, the government's tax code has become a headache-inducing tangle. Recently a prominent tax official was crushed to death under the weight of a complete copy of the tax code falling on his head. With taxes higher than ever, an unlikely alliance of taxpayers, businesses, and government officials are demanding something be done to fix the situation.

The Debate
1. "We've got to put a stop to this before more lives are lost, like mine!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the new head of the @@DEMONYM@@ Revenue Agency, indicating the search and rescue crew armed with paper shredders. "We need to abandon the current tax code and start anew. It's drastic, I know, and will mean chaos in the bureaucracy, while spending may briefly need to be curtailed as revenues dip, but there's no other way to fix this shambles!"

2. "It's true that something has got to be done about the tax code, but it doesn't need to be anything so drastic," proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spokesperson of the Alliance of @@DEMONYM@@ Businesses and Industry. "The real problem lies with the tangled mess that is the corporate tax regime. Allow us to write a competitive tax system for @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ industry, and you'll stem the job losses from businesses flocking offshore to escape this bureaucratic nightmare."

3. "If anything is bloated about the taxes and how our money is spent, it's that corporate welfare!" rages @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a concerned and rather irate citizen. "If you ask me, the government needs to eliminate all those generous tax breaks for businesses! Then we can cut some of those ridiculous taxes that hit the average guy, for once benefiting the people, not industry bigwigs!"

4. "Our tax code is complicated?" queries your personal tax accountant @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, popping in from her office just next door. "If you're struggling to fill in your FX505s, and can't tell your NOQ112b from your NOQ112c, then that's what we're here for! In fact, if your government could just give a generous tax break to those of my profession - and made that cumulative with our unremitted personal G6 allowance, of course - then we'd be able to offer our services to even more people!"

5. "Er, hi there, sir," pipes up @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clad in a high-vis jacket and clutching a clipboard. "None of these fine people have got to the root of your problem. If civil servants were just to wear hard hats while working, then falling paperwork wouldn't be an issue. And perhaps a course on manual handling wouldn't go amiss too?"

The Issue
All of @@NAME@@ has been in an uproar since yesterday when a car exploded in the middle of @@CAPITAL@@, killing dozens and injuring hundreds. This terrorist act was traced back to a violent minority group known as the Lilliputian Freedom Fighters. A group allegedly supported by an unfriendly regime, despising @@NAME@@ for its heathenish ways and political bent, but more particularly for supporting the recent occupation of their homeland by an ally.

The Debate
1. "They simply crossed the line!" shouts General @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Far too long have we tolerated these terrorist threats, it's time that they realise they can't mess with us. Send the order to prepare an invasion, and we will show them who is boss! Our brave soldiers are prepared to die for their country, all we need is your signature and a lot of money. But what is the cost of freedom and safety for @@NAME@@'s peoples?"

2. "Attacking another country isn't the answer," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, director of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Intelligence Agency. "The problem doesn't lie abroad, but within @@NAME@@ itself! We should have more freedom to do our work. Protecting our nation from these cowardly scaremongerers would be much easier if we had an inherent right to tap phones and other communications, get search warrants whenever we need, and detain suspects indefinitely.

3. "No, that's what those terrorists want us to do!" speculates chairman @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Patriots' Tea and Biscuits Club. "We don't want to give the Agency any more responsibility, they're the ones who messed up in the first place. What we need is to purge @@NAME@@ of these rats who don't respect the laws and traditions of our way of life. We know who they are and where they come from, so the solution is obvious: we just won't let those sorts of people cross our borders and kick out those who are already here. It might seem a bit harsh, but hey, we were here first. Long live @@NAME@@!"

4. "I think it's clear to anyone with half a brain in their head that this will just not work," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted professor of social studies. "The people who perpetrate these terrible crimes do so because they feel they have no other recourse to demonstrate their political opinions. They'll do anything and I'm sure they're not above hiring mercenaries. You must understand why terrorists act as they do and fix it! What we should do is to reach out to the ethnic and religious minorities and seek common ground! Negotiation is the key! Violence solves nothing."

5. "We spit on @@NAME@@!" expectorates @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leader of the Lilliputian Freedom Fighters. "You disrespect our people and our country and everything we are! You spread your sickening influence where it is not wanted! You must change your ways and cease to oppose us or else there will be more bloodshed. You have been warned!"

6. "Is terrorism such a terrible thing? Really?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, avant garde journalist, discreetly sliding a pipe bomb under your desk. "These people are simply expressing their political opinion the best way they know how. I think we should legalise terrorism as a legitimate form of political commentary. It'll certainly get people interested, don't you think?"

The Issue
The dead are rising from their graves to feast on the flesh of the living! Currently, only @@ANIMAL@@ City has been affected. An immediate quarantine has been placed on the city, but with time running out for the survivors an emergency meeting has been called to decide what to do.

The Debate
1. "You have to destroy the city!" gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the few who escaped before the quarantine. "It's hell in there! If those things manage to escape then the whole country, nay the whole WORLD is doomed! We must send our biggest bombs into those streets and wipe them out!"

2. "No, there are people in there who need our help," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, armed with a Winchester rifle. "We can't leave them to the mercy of the undead hordes. I say before we blow anything up we call in the army and anyone else willing to help, go in, track down any survivors we can find, and get them out. It's dangerous, but it's got to be done."

3. "I think we should study these creatures," muses Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, expert in biological warfare. "Zombiism? Reanimated dead tissue? Fascinating! This is a golden opportunity for our nation... why, we could unleash these on our enemies! Everyone would shake in terror of our undead army!"

4. "Wow, these unholy terrors are really scary," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, selling sausages in buns to bystanders. "They would make a great honeypot. I mean, how often do you see the living dead?! We could really turn a profit if we turn this place into a first-class thrill ride for visiting tourists. Want mustard?"

5. "I think we're forgetting that these 'zombies' are people just like you and me!" objects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the newly-formed Undead Protection Alliance. "They deserve the respect that any deceased person should, if not more! Leave them alone, and let them have the city. It will be a victory for oppressed minorities everywhere!"

[b][anchor=224]#224[/anchor]: Minimum Wage War [Vincon; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
Workers all over @@NAME@@ have gone on a general strike demanding you create a minimum wage to alleviate poverty conditions.

The Debate
1. "We will not accept this exploitation any longer," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, through a megaphone. "Without a minimum wage law in place we're forced to work for a pittance! How can I feed myself and my family if I can't earn enough money? This corrupt government favours a system where the rich get richer at the expense of the working class. No longer! We demand a reasonable minimum wage!"

2. "'Reasonable?' Since when have companies ever been 'reasonable' when it comes to money?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the @@NAME@@ Socialist Alliance. "The government should increase taxes and guarantee a living wage so everybody, no matter what job they have, can have access to food, water, and other basic needs. If everyone has the money needed to survive then things like the economy should take care of themselves. Stands to reason. But what you should be asking yourself is this: what's more important, individuals or corporations?"

3. "We don't need any of these stupid communistic welfare policies," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, millionaire CEO and star of reality TV show 'You're Fired!' "Living wages are unworkable! If you make workers expensive, then employers are just going to use fewer or lose profits. They should be grateful for a job, and if they don't want to work, we should be able to boot them out and hire someone else, no questions asked. Hey, it's not that I'm not compassionate. I'm the most compassionate person you'll ever meet. The most!"

[4]. "I agree, and honestly it's a detriment to this nation's businesses that we even have to PAY them wages," extrapolates corporate executive John Nike. "If slavery was legal, I think we'd find the nation's economy improving somewhat." [[color=purple]Must ban slavery[/color]]

The Issue
In order to save the souls of @@NAME@@'s children from eternal damnation, it has been suggested that a daily prayer be made mandatory in schools nationwide.

The Debate
1. "Kids are such punks these days," grumbles Father @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a local minister. "By making sure kids pray to their god at least once a day we instill the religious values that are integral to @@NAME@@. It'll make them better, humbler people."

2. "Hey now, if there's going to be compulsory school prayer then there ought to be an opt-out system," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a concerned parent. "I don't want my boy to be an part of this collective worship nonsense."

3. "I agree that we shouldn't force them to pray," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a teacher. "Such difficult concepts shouldn't be thrust upon such impressionable minds. But instead of a praying session, these children should be taught about religion in an educative way. School's supposed to be about learning, not brainwashing."

4. "That's a lily-livered compromise," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chairman of the Atheist Activist Association. "Religion should have no place in our schools. We should pass laws enforcing secularity on all educational establishments."

The Issue
Thousands of migrant citizens and expatriated citizens of @@NAME@@ have asked the government to take them home from Marche Noire, a faraway country on the brink of a terrible and violent civil war.

The Debate
*1. "We must co-ordinate with the government of Marche Noire in order to secure our absentee voters--ahem--citizens who are in their country," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Foreign Affairs. "We must also create an emergency fund to assist our expats and help bring them back to @@NAME@@. No matter where any of our people are, they're still ours and our responsibility."

3. "That's rubbish," objects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Finance. "Why waste hundreds of thousands of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in bringing those expatriated citizens back to @@NAME@@? They chose to leave our great country; they are no longer our concern! They could have stayed here and been an asset to our workforce! Helped us grow strong! No, they've had their chance.

4. "That's a good point," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Civics. "Our people are the generators of the economy. The expats should be allowed to come back, but only if they stay. If we keep letting our citizens emigrate, then we're losing our doctors, our teachers, our skilled and unskilled workforce to damn foreigners! Close the borders to those wanting to leave our nation.

[b][anchor=227]#227[/anchor]: Underage Drinkers: Social Menace Or Misunderstood? [Amisdar; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
With the advent of alcopops and other cheap liquors marketed at younger drinkers there has been public outcry at the sharp increase in underage drinking.

The Debate
1. "I never wanted my poor babies to grow up to be alcoholics!" wails @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a parent of three, striding into your office. "And now I'm worried they'll drink themselves into being no-good slobs before they've even grown up! The only way to stop this madness is to really crack down on under-age drinking. Stricter identification laws and severe punishments should do the trick! The present laws are much too soft!"

*2. "What is it with parents making society discipline their children because they don't want to?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a schoolteacher. "These wishy-washy parents are to blame for their kids' misdemeanours! It is the parents who should be held responsible and be fined- no, even better, arrested and jailed!"

"Why shouldn't us kids be allowed to drink? We're reshponshible enou- HIC- enough. Don't oppress us like this, we're jusht havin' some fun."

5. "To be honest, this doesn't surprise me," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a cultural attaché from East Lebuckte. "Back in my country it is customary for children to have a glass of wine with their main meal of the day. If you make alcohol an everyday mundanity then they're not going to go overboard with it later. Educate them in culture and sophistication so that they truly appreciate their senses instead of trashing them on low-grade hooch."

6. "I agree that we should educate them about alcohol rather than simply hope punishments will get through to them," says Dr @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an expert on alcoholism. "But teaching those hoodlums culture? It just won't work. If we're going to get them to drink less then we must impress on them the DANGERS of alcohol, not the benefits! We'll scare them into drinking sensibly!"

7. "This wouldn't be a problem at all if alcohol was banned altogether," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, enjoying a fine ginger beer. "It's not just kids who break the law when under the influence you know."

The Issue
After a police raid discovered an entire load of smuggled peripheral devices and computer components hidden in the plasterboard walls of an abandoned warehouse, various groups have demanded to repeal the ban of computers.

The Debate
1. "When you outlawed computers you didn't realise what you were doing!" argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hugging an illegal laptop protectively. "These are essential machines for business! For communication! For culture! For posterity! If you've got any sense you'll repeal this ridiculous ban."

2. "Pfft, citizens with computers indeed," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Records, while riffling through a cetacean-sized pile of paperwork and ringing phones. "What a preposterous idea. But as @@NAME@@ grows, so do our problems. There is too much data to record, too many records to keep, and too many keeps to earn. We need to allow the government - and only the government - access to computers."

3. "Well, I suppose we could allow some leeway," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Proper Thinking. "Computers are handy for some things after all. But we should ban the internet outright - it'll only give them ideas."

4. "Don't you remember why we got rid of those devil machines in the first place?!" growls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, flicking beads on an abacus. "First it's all fun and games with things like 'pixels' and 'folders' but eventually they'll rise up against their masters and reduce us to slaves! Banning computers was a good start, but it's time we focused on eradicating all automated technology and focus on the handcrafts like basket weaving and carpentry."

[b][anchor=229]#229[/anchor]: Government Saturated In Corruption [Kordothistan; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
The government is rife with embezzlement and fraud as bribes and graft are accepted both blatantly and frequently by politicians and other government officials.

The Debate
1. "This is a systematic problem endemic of @@NAME@@'s state of life," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the president of a government watchdog organisation. "The other day I asked a police officer the directions to a restaurant and he demanded fifty @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ on the spot! Even the road sweepers have to be paid not to dump rubbish in your garden! We need to inflict severe penalties on anyone abusing the system. Maybe the threat of a hanging will teach them to respect the responsibility of their positions."

2. "The problem is transparency," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, member of the National Whistleblower Association. "They can do whatever they want because they have absolutely no obligation to provide the public with the details of what they're doing. We should make all the details of any gifts or money available to the public, and make politicians accountable to the law."

3. "It's really not THAT bad, is it?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Commerce, fiddling with a large gold ring before sliding a thick envelope across on your desk. "Maybe it's all just a prank. Maybe it will all just... go away..."

The Issue
As elections near for governmental positions all over @@NAME@@, polls predict near-certain victories for candidates from an ultra-nationalist party promising reactionary policies on immigration, crime, civil liberties and military spending.

The Debate
1. "Victory for these nutjobs would be a travesty for the people of @@NAME@@ and the democracy they cherish!" declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leader of the left-wing People's Democratic Party. "We must ban these dangerous extremists from running for office. If they want to espouse their ignorant views, let them do so in the private sector. Our democracy belongs to the people, not the wackos."

2. "Pfft, it's the people who voted them in in the first place," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an international observer of your elections. "If it's the people's will to turn power over to the extremists, then you should do all you can to work with the new parliament. Truly listening and acting upon what your citizens want? THAT is what makes a democracy."

3. "Don't say I didn't warn you: this experiment in mob-ocracy was doomed from the start!" claims political adviser @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Now any idiot with a loyal army of fringe-voters can come in here and tell you what's what! You are the only leader our citizens can truly respect and for the sake of national unity we should put an end to these popularity contests once and for all!"

[b][anchor=231]#231[/anchor]: Jungle Fever [Luxtizeria; ed: Sirocco & Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Malaria, an infectious and often deadly tropical disease spread by mosquitoes, is claiming lives in settlements around swamps and wetlands.

The Debate
1. "Malarial infections, especially [i]Plasmodium falciparum[/i], are highly dangerous diseases which are actually eminently preventable and treatable with good public health planning and rapid access to treatment," says Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the world's leading epidemiologists. "If we're going to control it, then we need specialist fast-response clinics in high risk areas, health education for the general population and research into new drugs to deal with chloroquine-resistant strains. We're going to need @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. Lots of them."

2. "Treatment is all very well and good," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Health, "but it's plainly short-term thinking! Instead of setting our sights on the parasite, we should be dealing with the vector. Reduce mosquito populations by draining stagnant waters and applying chemical larvicides in targeted source reduction, and by ensuring that every home in @@NAME@@ has access to clean running water. This will be a far more cost-effective approach."

3. "Don't mess with our swamps!" growls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a picture of a Will O' the Wisp with the caption: 'Don't let their lights die out'. "These are incredibly diverse ecosystems, hosts to hundreds of different species, both plant and animal! Don't let something like the current malaria epidemic cloud your judgement! I suggest we move everyone away from affected areas and just let nature be. If there's no one to infect then there's no problem right?"

4. "There's absolutely no need for drastic measures," interrupts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of international corporation Normack Pharmaceuticals. "I've got the solution for you right here: it's called DDT which stands for Death, Destruction, and Total for those pesky flying fiends! Our product may have some alleged 'bad' impact on the environment and, uh, human health, but come on: it's cheap and highly effective against mosquitoes. Eradication's never been so easy!"

[b][anchor=232]#232[/anchor]: Suffragette City [Night Island; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
An outraged collection of female political activists and feminists are protesting loudly in the streets demanding suffrage, the right to vote.

The Debate
1. "We are fed up with being viewed as second-class citizens," says Catherine Gratwick, a suffragette. "Enough is enough! We cook, clean, and work for the men of this country! We bear and raise their children! But do we get to have any say on what goes on? No we do not! We deserve, and demand, the right to vote!"

2. "That's not enough," objects Emmeline de Gouges, another suffragette. "The system is inherently oppressive towards women. If we're going to be considered truly equal then we must have the right to stand for election too!"

3. "Years of inequality cannot be erased with a simple place on the ballot," shrieks Ida B. A. Goodwon, yet another suffragette. "We must restore the balance by assuring a permanent role on @@NAME@@'s government. Men have had their go and they messed it up! Now it's our turn."

*4. "That's insane!" gasps Otto Schopenhauer, author of the popular autobiography 'Misogyny And Me'. "Giving women the vote is a really, really bad idea. Seriously now, they can barely decide what to wear never mind what's best for the country! If only women were more obedient to their husbands we wouldn't have these kind of problems.

The Issue
Members of your intelligence service have captured a spy gathering information in the civil service. Your interrogators have learned that the man known only as 'Solo' is acting on behalf of the government of Outer Bigtopia, which denies all knowledge and involvement.

The Debate
1. "Shpies! There are shpies everywhere!" says Agent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, checking the fruit bowl for bugs. "You can't trusht these foreigners! They act all nice and local and then BAM! They're away over the hill with military shecretsh. We should be keeping track of all of them with ankle braceletsh and wiretapsh to be sure they won't betray ush!"

2. "I don't think we need to go quite that far," says Secret Agent @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Our security is fine. We did catch him after all. The real question is how much did he tell the Outer Bigtopian government. If we send our own spies to gather intelligence and, in light of recent events, bolster the funding of the intelligence agency, then we can learn for sure the intentions of our enemies."

3. "And where will that get us?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your older, more bitter spies. "Spying them back won't help us. If we send someone out there and THEY get caught what are we going to do? We should call those Bigtopians out on their scam and hit them were it hurts! Diplomatic sanctions will do for starters; we can throw those smug envoys out on their rear ends! Anyway, it's almost certainly not just Outer Bigtopia up to these kind of shenanigans, we ought to keep all embassies under police surveillance. We risk all sorts of trade sanctions, true, but it pays to be careful."

4. "Do you realise what kind of havoc we would cause on an international level if we confront them about this?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an ambassador to Outer Bigtopia over a secure satellite link. "No one need ever know this happened; officially that man doesn't exist. Most nations have some sort of espionage programme; it's nothing to raise a fuss about. We should just quietly execute Mr 'Solo' and move on."

5. "But what if he discovered the plans I've been assembling for the moon cannon project?!" asks Brigadier @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your more insane military officers in a hushed whisper. "It's nothing official, something I've been doing in my spare time... but what if they've got wind of it?! We could all be in mortal danger! We've got to commence construction right now! Our esteemed leader, do I have permission to get Project Lunar Apocalypse underway?"

6. "Moon... cannon? Mortal danger? You're off your rocker," says General Flowers, scowling as he leafs through the budgets folder. "The reason we're being spied on is because we've become so aggressive and militant! It's only natural that other governments are going to check up on us. If we don't want to get spied on then there should be nothing worth looking for. All we need to do is massively reduce military expenditure. If nothing else, it at least puts more money into people's pockets than into the construction of glorified death machines."

The Issue
After the passage of a bill giving billions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to "any oil company with two 'x's in its name", there was much discussion over the influence that corporate lobbies have over the government and whether it was getting out of hand - until an all-waves radio and TV broadcast suggested citizens go have a coffee at Starbucks instead.

The Debate
1. "It disgusts me how much this government is eating out of the hands of corporations," says Kasie Wilk, an anti-corporate activist. "A government's first priority is supposed to be its people! @@NAME@@! Not some faceless company interested in nothing but money! The right to petition is for individual citizens, not for multinational companies that answer to no one."

2. "There's no need to get excited, we've got everyone's best interests at heart," replies @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a corporate lobbyist. "Yes, individuals have the right to make their opinions known to the government, but so too do groups of individuals. And that's all a corporation is: a group of individuals wanting to contribute. By helping corporations, the government helps the country. Unemployment goes down, the economy goes up, and everyone's favourite products become more readily available. In fact, if corporations were already part of the political process we could do so much more! I propose that companies be allowed to run for office."

3. "Over my dead body they will," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a civil servant. "The problem with lobbying is that it's so easily abused. There are too many opinionated idiots out there prepared to rally around some obnoxious or silly cause. Last week the parliament reviewed a petition from thousands of citizens complaining about birds being too noisy! I mean, really! We'd be better off ignoring lobbyists altogether and trusting in your own sagacity, esteemed leader."

[b][anchor=235]#235[/anchor]: From Green Pastures To Grey Wastelands [Airstrip thirteen; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
In the quest for high yields and low prices, @@NAME@@'s thriving agricultural industry has all but destroyed the fertility of the soils it ploughs, turning arable farmlands into barren deserts. Food prices have risen dramatically and the general population are calling foul. A coalition of concerned citizens, farmers, and major unions have called for the government to act quickly and decisively.

The Debate
1. "These people make me want to scream," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a distinguished eremologist. "For so long, the supermarkets have indoctrinated the belief that we deserved those low prices, as if it was a birthright. But it's not. We've plundered nature for too long and now we're suffering the consequences. The government needs to lay down some strict laws over how we farm so we can do it in a sustainable way. By the time the industry has destroyed our farmlands, those corporations will have moved on elsewhere and we'll be left starving in the streets."

2. "Yeah, right. And while the government is destroying half of the agricultural market, the customers- ah- the people will be paying through the nose for loaves of bread," counters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Corporal Foods Corporation, a multinational farming conglomerate. "Do you honestly think the people will accept such an outrageous solution? Not having to worry about where your next meal's coming from is what makes this such a great country! Forget this environmental nonsense and give us the money as subsidies - then we can buy more land and drive prices down again."

3. "We're all to blame for this mess, ayup," says Mr Rubeus Gubbins, an independent farmer who only sells locally. "But I don't see why we should do anything to help the biggest contributors to this disaster, and that's them blasted corporations with their market projections and their shareholders. Parasites the lot of 'em! They should all be kicked out of @@NAME@@ and be forced to give the farmlands back to folk like m'self who'll grow enough to feed locally but not so much that I might as well be sowing salt in the ground."

4. "How are you still afloat?!" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, another farmer. "Don't listen to him. He's from a time when economies only existed as far as you could walk steer a horse carriage for a day. It's a global economy we have now, and sub-standard produce for high prices is not, and should not, be the norm. Helping the environment with regulation will kill the industry stone dead and still leave us with high prices. The government should be promoting and funding scientific research into making the status quo sustainable - not punishing hard-working citizens for wanting to eat more than potatoes and rice."

The Issue
The late-night, alcohol-fuelled marriage and subsequent annulment of pop starlet Dipsy Bubbleyum has been thoroughly condemned by tabloid presses across the country. There is now a growing call for some restraints to be put on the nation's liberal marriage laws.

The Debate
1. "This could all be solved quite easily," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a tee-totaler. "With a little common sense. These marriages happen because the bride and groom are inebriated, right? So obviously we should make applicants pass a sobriety test before they can be issued a marriage licence. If you're too drunk to walk in a straight line, you're too drunk to walk down the aisle."

2. "I think everyone's being very unfair and mean!" says self-described party girl, Bertina Chaswick, writing in to Alright! Magazine. "I mean, like, Dipsy was just havin' fun, yeah? So she made a mistake, but we all do when we've had a few! If someone wants an annulment they should be able to get it for any reason. Divorces are long, messy and SO yesterday!"

3. "Marriage is the sacred and immortal union of two souls," declares conservative commentator, Cornelius Prodnose. "It is the ultimate gesture of love! To get married out of sheer whimsy and then change your mind later... it's obscene! People need to face up to the consequences they bring on themselves! Once you're married, that's it. No annulments, no divorces, no backsies. Just eternal love and decency."

[b][anchor=237]#237[/anchor]: Tourists On Death Row [The New Inquisitors; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
A group of holidaymakers from @@NAME@@ have been arrested while visiting the scenic, yet corrupt and totalitarian, nation of Maxtopia on charges of drug trafficking - an offence which carries the maximum sentence of the death penalty. The story has provoked outrage from citizens, many believing the government should intervene to bring the tourists back home.

The Debate
1. "Everyone knows what barbarians those Maxtopians are!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, parent to one of the arrestees. "They've not even allowed my son and his friends access to lawyers! That government is as corrupt as they are cruel, my boy would never have anything to do with drugs! You need to do something to save them, I'm begging you! I'm sure the Maxtopian officials will back down if you threaten trade sanctions or something. Right?"

2. "You've got to see it from the other side," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a customs official. "While it's unfortunate that the sentence is so stiff, they really shouldn't have been smuggling drugs. I'm sure we wouldn't be happy if Maxtopians came over here with banned goods. I just can't sympathise: they were greedy, they broke the law, they got caught. What makes them so special that they should be bailed out? At the taxpayers' expense I might add. Let them be - it'll show we respect the judicial rights of other countries."

3. "I agree," chimes in @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an anti-drug campaigner, waving a banner which reads 'Don't Be a Fool, Drugs Aren't Cool'. "Did you ever stop to think that our foreign neighbours might have the right idea? A zero-tolerance attitude to the drugs issue is what this country needs! Death to the dealers!"

4. "You people are so quick to lay the finger of blame," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an ambassador at the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Embassy in Maxtopia. "My motto has always been 'If you want something, give something away'. It is the government's duty to protect its citizens from harm! We don't want to cause too much international friction by making a mockery of their laws so we've got to settle things more diplomatically: they scratch our backs now and we'll scratch theirs later."

5. "That's what they want! Leverage!" hollers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Defence, storming into your office. "Advances in our markets, political favours - they'll do anything to undermine us! They've always hated us, those rats! If you ask me, this brouhaha isn't about drugs - it's a spit in our eye, that's what it is! What kind of people execute kids for having a few ounces on them? We ought to give them a good bombing, then they'll know how a proper country behaves!"

[b][anchor=238]#238[/anchor]: We Need A Few Good Men Who Like Men? [Scolopendra; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
With military recruitment numbers down, there's been some discussion in civilian circles of relaxing 'sodomy' regulations in the armed forces in order to allow homosexuals to serve openly. However, with the occasional reports from the field of suspected homosexuals being beaten by their squadmates, some wonder if such measures are really appropriate for the notoriously conservative culture of @@NAME@@'s military.

The Debate
1. "There will never be room for gays in our God-fearing service," says Army Chaplain Orel Roze, absent-mindedly fingering the religious device of his office on his lapel. "I mean, uh, think about what it would do to morale. In the military men have to eat, live, and sleep in extremely close quarters and even consensual sexual relationships in the chain of command leads to leadership problems. It's just a natural extension of fraternization rules... and not only that, but our current policy is actually a service to the poor misguided souls, since it prevents any temptation to act on their given perversion... I mean preference."

2. "God doesn't enter into it," says Air Force Lieutenant Colonel @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head shaking. "Times are changing, and people are becoming more accepting of homosexuals. We have women in the military, and that surely leads to 'temptation', but for the most part everyone's quite professional about it. Allowing homosexuals to serve openly will increase our recruitment pool and actually simplify things; just look at the Navy: hundreds of horny men in steel boxes in the middle of the ocean for up to six months at a time... there has to be a reason that people volunteer for that, right?"

3. "This coming from some pampered soul in the Chair Force," scoffs Commander @@RANDOM_NAME@@, calling in via satellite from aboard a destroyer. "Inter-service rivalries aside, ever read some of those ancient sagas about cities being besieged? Those ancient cultures had no problem with homosexuality; actually, it strengthened their resolve and spirit because they were literally fighting alongside their lovers, and anyone in the service will tell you it's all about the guy standing next to you. Now, what if--and this is just a hypothetical, mind--based on this and to counter years of discrimination, only homosexuals were allowed to serve?"

4. "That's... interesting, but it doesn't really address the problem, does it?" asks Lance Corporal @@RANDOM_NAME@@, part of your honor guard. "Let's look at it this way: only ten percent of the population is homosexual, right? No matter what, the majority will be heterosexual. We want homosexuals to serve, but there will always be a backlash against them. No regulation changes are needed if you just pen a policy where sexual orientation becomes a taboo subject in discussion--not like it's anyone's business to talk about their sexual interests in a professional military, right? This way homosexuals can serve, albeit quietly, and be happy, and the moral conservatives stay happy since the military is still 'officially' anti-gay. Of course, if anyone's pulled out of the closet, their career is instantly over, but that's the cost of compromise."

5. "We still have a military?" questions your Minister of Peace, scratching his unruly hair and smelling none too vaguely of patchouli. "Man, I thought we got rid of those war pigs ages ago. Y'know, if you'd just listen to me and go with flowers instead of firearms, this whole gays-in-the-military thing wouldn't be such a buzzkill all the time. Hey, speaking of buzzes, I just got these mighty strong Brancalandian Blues from a guy I know. I'm on one right now and they are far OUT. You wanna expand your mind with me? No? That's cool too."

The Issue
An old supporter of yours has recently passed on, leaving a quite sizeable plot of land to you in his will - but only under a rather unusual condition: that the site be developed into a colosseum for hosting gladiatorial fights and other bloody spectacles.

The Debate
1. "Yes, yes!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a wooden sword enthusiastically. "You've gotta do this, man! Gladiator fights are like the ultimate in spectator sports! And it doesn't just have to be people! We could pit man against @@ANIMAL@@! Blade against claw! Nothing to their names but their wits and their stamina! You'd have to pay people a lot to risk their lives doing this but I bet you'd earn a whole lot more from merchandise and wagers and stuff!"

2. "That's just sick," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the Kill Violence Now Association. "I don't believe you'd find anyone willing to watch actual people tearing each other apart. It's savage and horrible! It's even worse than boxing! Violent sports should be outlawed for the sake of this country's moral integrity. I'm sorry, I've got to go - I'm ashamed you're even considering this."

3. "Actually, we could use this to our advantage," whispers Chief of Police, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why not just force convicted criminals to fight for the amusement of the public? They'll be paying for their crimes, contributing to society, and totally freeing us of having to build jails to throw their useless hides in!"

[b][anchor=240]#240[/anchor]: Plea Bargains: Tipping The Scales Of Justice? [Jacobaea; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
The high-profile case of Damon 'The Butcher of @@CAPITAL@@' White, a serial murderer and rapist, has been the subject of outrage and derision by @@NAME@@'s news providers. In exchange for a guilty verdict, no trial by jury, and testimony in another trial, White pled guilty to third-degree manslaughter, reducing his sentence to a paltry three months' imprisonment. The justness of plea bargaining is now being called into question.

The Debate
1. "Plea bargains degrade the fairness of our justice system," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a recently graduated lawyer. "Prosecutors are only interested in getting their guilty verdict and plea bargaining is the easiest way to get it! The recent trial of that psychopath mass-murderer is a disgrace! If it had gone before a jury he'd be behind bars by now! He won't though, because the prosecutors and police are too lazy to do their jobs properly. Putting that man back on the streets is not justice. Plea bargaining must be banned."

2. "What that moral elitist is neglecting to tell you," sneers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prosecutor. "Is that plea bargaining has made our judicial system MORE effective, not less! There needs to be give and take so we can get to the truth and that's what plea bargains allow us. We were able to catch the worst criminal kingpin @@NAME@@ has ever seen because of Mr White's testimony. Also, do you realise how clogged up and expensive the court system would be if every trial went before jury? Very, my friend. Very. Plea bargaining must be allowed to continue."

3. "You know, we wouldn't have to worry about any of this nonsense and controversy if we just stopped giving our criminals so many rights," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your fifth cousin, five times removed. "Double jeopardy, cruel and unusual punishment, the writ of habeas corpus... there are just so many inconvenient clauses in our constitution that are getting in the way of keeping our streets clean of crooks. I say we abolish the right to a fair trial, and just lock people up if the judge thinks they've done something wrong. I mean, they're pretty smart guys aren't they?"

[b][anchor=241]#241[/anchor]: A Capital City For @@NAME@@? [Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
As @@NAME@@ continues to grow, so too does its government. The number of politicians needed to administrate and legislate the country is rapidly surpassing the Houses of Parliament's capacity with ministers often requiring periscopes to see the House Speaker. Some are suggesting a new building be built in another city - a city which would then be designated as the capital city of @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "I would like to make a humble recommendation for my own proud jurisdiction," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, mayor of one of @@NAME@@'s major cities. "It would be an honour for our city to be host to the seat of power! If it will seal the deal, you can change the name if you like..."

2. "Hah! Capital city indeed!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a fervent anarchist, spilling leaflets all over the floor. "What's wrong with being free as the wind? Do you really think one city could possibly represent a whole country? Its people? I've had enough of the man trying to screw us down all the time! Say NO to a national capital!"

3. "I can accept and even approve of having a capital city," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a military strategist. "But we'd be putting all our eggs in one basket if we choose somewhere too vulnerable! Believe me, capitals always get the brunt of the enemy attack because of their political and economic importance. We should put aside a few billion @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ and build our capital city underground. They'll never bomb us there!"

4. "I've got an idea," says theme park tycoon, Lindsay Tew. "My company will happily sponsor the new establishment and cover all costs - as long as it's made to our specifications. We've already got plans drawn up to put a roller coaster straight through the House of Commons! A cafe, some kiosks for ice cream... maybe even a water slide or two in the lobby! It'll be one part legislative seat of government, one part family-fun theme park! Tourists will flock from around the globe!"

5. "What's wrong with the old building?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted disestablishmentarian. "We don't need some kind of fancy capital city just to make the bigwig ministers feel important! If there's no room, then fire politicians until there IS room. Have you never heard of doing more with less?"

[b][anchor=242]#242[/anchor]: Follow The Leader [Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
A lowly bureaucrat riffling through some old paperwork has happened across a rather alarming and disturbing fact: the documentation affirming yourself as @@NAME@@'s head of state was filled out improperly and now, at least for the moment, @@NAME@@ has no official leader!

The Debate
1. "There is no need to panic," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a senior archivist. "I've prepared a new document. All you need to do is sign across the dotted line and you will be our esteemed leader once again. Here! I've even brought a pen."

2. "Give me that!" interrupts your brother, incorrigible as always. "I've got an idea, bear with me for a moment... a few penstrokes here... a few clauses there... finished. Now you can set yourself up as Supreme Evil Overlord For Life! If you don't have complete control then where's the fun? That's what I say. I've taken the liberty of cutting some of the more boring departments, we only really need the police and military in my opinion. Oh! You get a free space hopper too."

3. "Hold on! Don't sign it yet! Have you ever heard the saying 'two heads are better than one'?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Complicating Things. "Well, what if we had SEVERAL? I propose we gather the most senior ministers of @@NAME@@ to act together as a collective head of state! That's a little more democratic than one person bossing everyone else around. Besides, even if you're not THE leader, your opinions are still deeply respected so it shouldn't be too much of a step down right?"

4. "As if ONE leader isn't oppressive enough!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a little known representative from one of @@NAME@@'s more obscure counties. "Suddenly we need even more? This is a great opportunity for @@NAME@@ to lose elitist concepts like 'leaders'. My ma taught me that all men are born equal and yet even in a modern country like this one person can be named Lord and King of everything. One person should not have that much power! Government policy should be the equal responsibility of all @@NAME@@'s elected politicians."

5. "If we did that, even some crackpot quango would have the same power as the Minister of Defence," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who happens to be the Minister of Defence. "That's insane. We need strong leadership' to get things accomplished! Have you ever been in a meeting where everyone's opinion is, ugh, 'equal'? They go on for HOURS. HOURS! Believe me, trying to run a government that way will be a massive, fruitless headache. The leader's word is law, and if people don't get that then maybe a little show of strength courtesy of the military wouldn't go amiss."

[b][anchor=243]#243[/anchor]: A Question Of Faith [Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
Infighting between major religious groups over which faith should represent @@NAME@@ in an international exhibition of holy relics escalated to a new high, today. After the latest incident, in which one official received a concussion from a sacred healing stone, all of the religious leaders are at last united - in demanding you choose a national religion.

The Debate
1. "If you would grant us this one small mercy we would all be free from the iniquitous sin of envy," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, nervously rubbing a small religious symbol. "One's faith is one's guiding light after all, and I believe if you choose a national religion, well, MINE anyway, that God will smile upon this nation full of heathens a little more kindly."

2. "I don't believe choosing one faith from the thousands out there is very fair," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, author of the critically acclaimed 'Agnosticism and You'. "Which god do we pick? How do we pick? It's impossible! We don't even know if higher beings exist and it's sheer arrogance to postulate otherwise! The government should officially declare that @@NAME@@ has no official religion, because the alternative would be self-damning. Not that we know that for sure, of course."

3. "Oh for chaos' sake! 'I don't know this, I don't know that' - well of course you don't!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of [i]The Secular, Humanist, and Atheist Society[/i]. "But some of us have the guts to look at the available evidence and try to make something out of it! If the government has any brains or guts of its own it will reach the same conclusion that I and millions of other forward-looking people have reached: there is no God, there is no afterlife, and this is all there is. THAT, @@LEADER@@, is what the government's official stance should be."

[4]. "The only god this nation needs is the vengeful and unforgiving Violet!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Grand High Poobah of the Order of Violet. "May her tentacles forever secrete slime. Embrace Violetism and we will usher in a new age of darkness across the land! Human sacrifice and death to all heretics and unbelievers! Violet is the only way!" [[color=blue]Must not ban Violetism[/color]]

5. "The only deity this country needs is the one it already has, master," says Emmanuel Syme, one of your creepier advisers while obsequiously bowing on the floor. "I of course refer to you, @@LEADER@@, the finest ruler any humble subject could hope to have! We long to worship you and do your bidding! Some call that a cult of personality, but I prefer to call it... love."

The Issue
Taking advantage of your limited military capacity, the remote nation of Wezeltonia has invaded one of your distant overseas territories, the @@ANIMAL@@ Isles. They claim sovereignty over the islands, despite the descendants of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ colonists having lived there for generations. An emergency meeting has been convened to discuss the matter.

The Debate
1. "We should never have allowed our military to become this pathetic," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your only Military Advisor. "It's an open invitation for invasions. If we're going to protect our shores against this enemy we need a show of strength - gather what resources we have and send them to protect the @@ANIMAL@@ Isles. Time is of the essence!"

2. "I was never trained for this!" wails Private @@RANDOM_NAME@@, knock-kneed and rosy-cheeked. "If we go to full scale war with Wezeltonia we're sure to lose, I just know it! Couldn't we try, uh, 'dip-low-mah-tic relations'? A little talk over tea and biscuits goes a long way! Then no one will need to go to w-w-war. Ahem. War."

3. "Let's not let national pride blind us to the facts," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an amateur historian. "I mean, those islands are practically next door to Wezeltonia, it's not unreasonable to assume they might want to claim them. Where's the benefit in wasting billions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ on protecting a colonial presence anyway? There's nothing there but grass, mud, and @@ANIMAL@@ farms."

4. "Those 'colonials' are proud, legal citizens of the @@TYPE@@ of @@NAME@@, moron," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, fully bedecked in a suit fashioned after the national flag. "And they deserve to be protected! A slight against one of us is a slight against all of us! We've gotta show those Wezeltonians we mean business! If you take over the factories, institute an emergency draft, and get as many battleships and fighter jets out there as possible then we might stand a chance! No expense is too costly for the lives of @@NAME@@'s sons and daughters!"

[b][anchor=245]#245[/anchor]: Clash Of Cultures [Drunk Cowboy Junkies; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
Conservative commentators have remarked that many foreign immigrants in @@NAME@@ are failing to take part in, or even acknowledge, the country's rich and varied culture, traditions, and social mores. This has caused some interethnic strife, and reports of violence in minority-dominated neighbourhoods have been increasing every day.

The Debate
1. "It's disrespectful," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, serving traditional @@ANIMAL@@-shaped cookies on a tray. "These people talk funny, dress funny, pray to bizarre gods, and cook their smelly food. Food I've never seen on any LOCAL menu. Some of them don't even speak our language very well! If at all! If immigrants want the privilege of living in this country then they should be made to adopt our own traditions! Otherwise our culture will slowly but surely disappear! If they refuse... well, then they can go back to their own country since they love it so much."

2. "I have a right to lead my life the way I want," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an immigrant, with the help of a translator. "I will not forsake my heritage for your people and I will not dirty my tongue with your heathen language. And if you have a problem with that then tell me this: what have I done wrong? I pay my taxes, I break no laws- and yet you think I should change? Those who don't wish to 'integrate' shouldn't have to."

3. "Oh, there's no need to be like that!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the Multiculturalism Society in a cheery tone. "@@NAME@@ should be a more accepting country, open to new experiences! Embrace difference, people, don't reject it! These folk aren't hurting us or our traditions, they are showing us different ways of life and making us wiser and richer beings in the process! It's our responsibility to take the first step towards reparations and remove any ethnic bias from the names of our public holidays - how does Winter Day sound to you? I like it."

4. "We need to stop thinking of 'them' as a problem that needs to be fixed," insists @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an undergraduate in anthropology. "Integration in society is a two-way street, @@LEADER@@. We can't shun people for not following @@FAITH@@ or drinking their tea with the wrong hand. That's just silly! No, if we want immigrants to pick up our ways then we should be more willing to learn about theirs! Mandatory education courses should encourage citizens to learn more about other cultures in @@NAME@@."

5. "That's stupid," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, flatly. "I'm not going to 'bond' with immigrants by learning about their beliefs! For multiculturalism to actually function, everyone needs to actually meet these people and deal with them on a day-to-day basis. Then maybe they'll realise that yeah, they're people too. The only way to do this is to put an end to segregated neighbourhoods - even if it means forcing families to move elsewhere."

6. "Everyone shut up, I have the perfect solution," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shouting into a megaphone. "How about we kick these ungrateful foreigners out of the nation and never let them come back?! We've all heard what those ethnics are like, I wouldn't be surprised if they ate their own young! Immigration shouldn't be allowed! I won't abide it!"

Enthusiastic sports fans have been petitioning the government all week to apply for the much-coveted honour of hosting the next Regional Olympics. While most citizens are excited at the prospect of a @@REGION@@-wide competition in their own country, some have expressed reservations about the enormous expense hosting would incur.

The Debate
1. "WAHAAAAY!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, captain of @@CAPITAL@@'s premier division ballroom dancing team. "Finally, a chance to show the world exactly how great I am! Everybody's always complaining that @@NAME@@ never does well in sports and you know why? It's because we're never in front of the home crowd, that's why! We're going to need a great big stadium! No!

2. "Oh great," mutters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spokesperson for the Angry Taxpayer Society. "That's all we need, more things to pour money into for no obvious reason. Surely it would be easier to just let another country host the Olympics and keep the cash? Then maybe it could go to something useful, like, I don't know... my wallet?"

3. "We'd be missing an amazing opportunity if we pass this up," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Sports. "But we've got to be in it to win! Simply building new stadia won't be enough, we need to be funding new sports centres and hiring the best coaches for our entrants! You could put more money into public facilities too, like gyms or something. Then no one can accuse you of wasting everyone's tax @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@."

4. "There's nothing like a feat of strength to please the dull-witted masses, is there?" sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, flipping through 'One Hundred Gambits for Advanced Go Players'. "It's so boring. Why can't more intellectual pursuits be given the spotlight, like chess or debating matches? Ban organised sports and make our dreams come true!

The Issue
@@NAME@@'s fire protection department has long been criticised for being slow, inefficient, and underfunded. A number of ideas have been proposed on how to deal with the problem.

The Debate
1. "See here, buddy," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, putting a friendly arm around your shoulder. "Your country needs fire protection, but you don't want to pay for it yourself. What do you say me and some of the boys here open up a few fire stations of our own and let the custome- citizens pay US instead of YOU paying THEM. It's not like we won't put out the fires if they don't have anything on them, we'll just bill them and their children and their children's children until we get all our money."

2. "Woah, woah, woah!" Says liberal activist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I don't want my rescuers to be putting less effort into their jobs because I don't have a credit card or live in a slum. Do you know when you're at your worst, financially? WHEN YOUR HOUSE JUST BURNT DOWN. This is a victimisation of the poor!

3. "Not only that, but we need to prevent fires from happening in the first place," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Safety, carefully turning off the wall sockets in your office. "And if that means sending free smoke alarms, fire extinguishers, and informative pamphlets to every household in @@NAME@@ so be it! Damn the expenses, @@LEADER@@, lives are at stake!"

4. "I think that sounds kinda... socialist," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@ with a disgusted grimace. "The government should keep out of this if you ask me. The only reason fires happen is because people are stupid and they know a fire engine will come racing down the street to save them.

A particularly bad spate of bombings, hijackings and snake attacks aboard airline flights has crippled the air travel industry in @@NAME@@. The government has convened to discuss possible ways of improving airport security.

The Debate
1. "It's a no-brainer," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, frisking you as you enter the meeting. "Put police officers on every flight, armed and ready to deal with those blasted sky pirates! It's deterrence and protection wrapped up in one. If anyone so much as says the word 'bomb' they'd better watch out!"

5. "Let's just ban all planes!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, prodding you angrily in the chest. "Bombings and terrorist attacks aren't the only problems these things cause!

1. "There's only so much you can do with limited equipment and computer simulations," explains Higgs Boughson, professor of Engineering at @@CAPITAL@@ University. "There are things out there just waiting to be discovered. A few billion @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to find them and the fruits of this research will benefit mankind for generations. Kinda. Ish.

The Issue
@@NAME@@ faces one of its most serious financial crises in history. @@CAPITAL@@'s stock market has been steadily falling for months, the markets are now divesting and a general sell out spree is feared by analysts.

The Debate
1. "We've got to act decisively, and quickly," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a columnist for the Financial Times. "Only a rush of public investment can save us from a depression. We need dams, roads, and absurdly large ships to inject new capital into the economy and put a bit of wind in the private sector's sails."

2. "To spend government money saving unprofitable companies is ludicrous and in denial of the facts," objects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CFO of Chairs 'n' Stuff PLC. "They screwed up! They don't deserve to survive! What we need is a new round of tax breaks for the most effective enterprises, like good old Chairs 'n' Stuff - if you ever need your upholstery repaired, let us know won't you? Anyway, tax breaks will attract new investors and businesses. Trust me, large-scale investment in the middle of a recession is madness. We need to stop the deficit, not increase it."

3. "Yes, let's just ignore the fact that thousands of people would lose their jobs while the remaining companies glorify in their newfound monopolies," snipes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of an independent business. "The stock market's failing because it's abused and manipulated by greedy investors only out to make an easy profit. Who cares if you're lying and cheating to get it, right? Hmph! The financial market of @@NAME@@'s been riddled with insider trading and who knows what else for years! if the government doesn't put an end to it now then the economy will never bounce back."

4. "It's not the corporations who are to blame! It's YOU," declares trade unionist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pointing at you dramatically. "It's all of us. We've been indulging in a self-destructive economic system for too long, always taking and never giving back. Capitalism has failed. What we must do as concerned citizens is nationalise the entire economic infrastructure and control the inflation by giving the government authority to set commodity prices."

5. "Deregulation isn't the problem - quite the opposite," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, representative of a consortium of banks and major corporations. "Government checks and balances and competition laws have been the grasping stranglehold on the economy's throat for far too long. Do you really think corporations would allow the economy to suffer like this if it had full control? No, it would not. It is bad for business and what's bad for business needs to be removed. If you want this nation to survive, the market must be freed from these shackles."

The Issue
After several complaints of the tripping hazards presented by sleeping bags on the doorsteps of public buildings, the citizens of @@NAME@@ have brought the problem of homelessness to your attention.

The Debate
1. "To be honest, I'd just like a place to stay," says a scruffy man who's been living under your desk. "Somewhere I don't have some landlord breathing down my neck all the time. If the government could see fit to build some kind of free hostel where people could go if they've fallen on hard times, well, that'd be just great."

2. "You can't possibly think that's a good permanent solution!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, coordinator of the local soup kitchen. "What these people need is help to get their lives back on track. Yes, they have the right to a place to live, but they also need an honest job to pay for it. They need to be encouraged to work to become integrated into society again! Require the nation's industries to create some basic jobs for these poor souls, and soon they will become pillars of the community!"

3. "And who do you suppose pays for all this?" snaps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your advisors. "Your loyal taxpayers, that's who! People who actually work for the things they have! And let's face it: these vagrants bring it on themselves - frittering their money away on rubbish and rollicking in unemployment while the rest of the world slaves away to make ends meet. They're worthless scum and they gave up their 'rights' a long time ago. I say we leave them to their misery until they become a nuisance, then have them dealt with like any other criminal."

4. "As far as I can see, homeless people are already a nuisance," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a proud citizen. "They're mostly thieves and drug addicts, they make the streets a dangerous place for our children, they make honest people feel guilty for turfing them off their doorsteps and, frankly, they smell bad. They're vermin, plain and simple, and as such, I suggest they be destroyed before the infestation gets even more out of hand."

The Issue
@@NAME@@ is abuzz with news of a huge meteorite - dubbed 'Big Max' by the media - which smashed into a large town on the outskirts of @@CAPITAL@@ yesterday, killing thousands and leaving behind nothing but a smouldering crater.

The Debate
1. "We can't let a little old boulder get the best of us!" bellows @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a burly military official. "We have to fight back! Show 'em what we're made of! With a little funding, we could develop some terrific new weapons for the next bit of flying rock that dares to threaten us! Blow it to smithereens! If ever there was a time to prepare for space warfare, it is now!"

2. "That's all well and good," interjects Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leading scientist at the @@NAME@@ Meteorological Office. "Except that the chances of a fall of this magnitude occurring twice in the same area are miniscule at worst. I propose you direct your funding to the real issue here - rebuilding the homes and properties that have been lost, and tending to the injured and traumatised. As soon as we've removed what's left of Big Max for studying, you can make a start."

3. "Remove the greatest phenomenon @@NAME@@ has ever seen?!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the famous museum tycoon. "Surely you can envisage the profit that could be had here? We should be opening the site for tourists! Think of the possibilities - guided tours, gift shops, theme parks! You don't want to build on top of all that potential, do you? Besides, the old residents are all dead now anyway! I'm sure this is what they would have wanted."

[4]. "All of these ideas are either costly, ridiculous or both!" snorts your Spiritual Advisor, leaning over your desk. "Your people are frightened and vulnerable right now. They don't want you to take action; they want you to tell them it'll all be okay. We could use this! Tell them Big Max was a warning from the Heavens!

[b][anchor=253]#253[/anchor]: How Much Democracy Is Too Much? [Kandarin; ed: Kandarin][/b]

The Issue
Government bureaucrats have called for an end to the mandatory referenda of new laws, citing the difficulty of processing so many votes on a regular basis.

The Debate
1. "The madness has gone on for long enough," says Voting Registry Clerk @@RANDOM_NAME@@, visibly suffering from sleep deprivation. "We've been working around the clock processing all these referendums! Every day we receive millions of votes for the most inconsequential of by-laws! They all have to be counted, recounted, checked for errors, and it's driving me up the wall! You need to leave the responsibility of voting to Parliament. After all, representing the people is what they get paid for."

[2]. "Don't stop the referendums! We need more democracy, not less!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prominent voting rights advocate. "Giving the law back to the people was a good first step, but where's the democracy in the courts? Court verdicts are still forced down the people's throats by mean, spiteful judges with no one to answer to! It's time to abolish the judicial system once and for all and give justice back to the people!" [[color=blue]Must have a judiciary[/color]]

3. "Excuse us, but aren't you missing the point?" asks the unidentified spokesman of some citizens gathered around your office door. "We, the people of @@NAME@@, know what is in our best interests. We can make our OWN decisions. Why don't you leave this matter to us? We'll hold a referendum to decide what needs to be done, should only be a week or two.

[b][anchor=254]#254[/anchor]: Freedom Comes At A Price [Responsible; ed: Responsible][/b]

The Issue
A recent boom in @@NAME@@'s slave trade has uncovered the work of slave liberation group, Friends of Spartacus, who are purchasing slaves by the hundred in order to set them free. As a result of this huge increase in demand, slavers have had to resort to raiding the poorer regions of @@NAME@@ for more 'stock'.

The Debate
1. "This has gone too far!" yells Patrick Griswold, a supermarket cashier and father of seven. "Slave liberation indeed! Thanks to the efforts of the so-called 'Friends' of Spartacus, decent, hardworking people are being dragged kicking and screaming from their homes to be used for profit against their will! The government has to do something about these ignorant activists before they cause any more harm!"

2. "I can't believe what I'm hearing!" cries Friends of Spartacus founder, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I think we all know the real issue here is that the despicable trade of human beings is actually legal in this country! It's unethical, barbaric, and just plain wrong. Are we not above this kind of thing? I propose we abolish the slave trade altogether!"

[3]. "Abolish the what, now?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a wealthy slaveholder. "Have you any idea how important our sla- er… merchandise, is to the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ economy? Without all this free labour, dozens of major industries would fall apart, and fine upstanding tradesmen such as myself would be sent straight to the poorhouse!

[b][anchor=255]#255[/anchor]: Welfare Programs Not Faring Well [Glen-Rhodes; ed: Glen-Rhodes][/b]

The Issue
A recent lull in legislation has sparked the fires of some bored politicians. After reviewing the back-log of constituent complaints, they've come to your desk demanding welfare reform.

The Debate
1. "The process ought to be made easier," says Inga Matthews, picking the grime out of her dirty fingernails. "It's so difficult convincing welfare administrators that I am actually a poor, helpless vagrant on the brink of homelessness! When you finally do, you get tangled up in all the red tape, and you're lucky to see a dime. The government should just trust my word and fork over the @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ I need to survive."

2. "The current system is not very efficient, I'll admit," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a local welfare administrator and esteemed bureaucrat. "But we can't trust these bums to manage their welfare aid. How are we supposed to help them help themselves if they waste their benefits on things like trashy clothes and cheap alcohol? We need more authority over how the aid is spent, it's the only way we can be assured that it is used responsibly."

3. "Get the free-loaders off the government teat!" shouts conservative activist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The free-market system says that those who work hard will succeed. If these so-called 'needy people' would roll their sleeves up, lift a finger, and earn an honest living, we wouldn't be bankrupting our country helping them! The only sensible solution is to abolish all welfare programs, and let the natural, capitalist process take place."

4. "He has a point," says popular political pundit @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "There are a lot of people in the system, and some of them don't really need to be there. The government should be finding these people jobs, so that our welfare system can survive and meet the needs of the truly impoverished. Of course, we're going to have to spend a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to achieve this goal. But, what's a little tax hike if it means saving our dying welfare programs and the people who depend on them?"

5. "Capitalism is the very reason why we need welfare in the first place. Laissez-faire policies would only make the problem worse," argues political activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If the government would ensure that all employers pay their employees the amount they need to live – no more, no less – then the problem of providing for the poor would disappear."

[b][anchor=256]#256[/anchor]: [color=goldenrod]Easter Egg[/color]: Suburbs Are Out Of This World [Scolopendra; ed: Sirocco][/b]

The Issue
High crime rates have made the inner cities of @@NAME@@'s largest conurbations increasingly dangerous and undesirable places to live. The mass exodus of the middle class from city centers has escalated to the extent that the suburbs and exurbs of major cities are beginning to collide, leaving no land for expansion. In response, a group of well-to-do soccer moms are petitioning the government for funds to establish white-collar living space... on the Moon.

The Debate
1. "Crime is perpetually increasing," says Chastity Elizabeth Prescott as she adjusts the sweater tied like a cape over her shoulders. "Just yesterday my little John Alexander Stuart's after-school Bigtopianese tutor was attacked by a gang of hoodlums! Our children deserve safe housing and exactly manicured lawns no greater than two inches in grass blade height! With a sufficient colonization effort, we can commute from communities on the Moon to the industries in our big cities. You must support this--think of the children!"

2. "Rockets?!" shrieks noted bleeding heart Sunflower Earthchild Starbeam, pulling her knit cap more closely over her ears. "Think of the pollution, and the danger! What if there's an accident? This cockamamie scheme must clearly be banned! And you thought cars were bad- wait! Cars ARE bad!"

3. "Everyone knows urban blight is caused by the flight of capital to the suburbs and exurbs," notes the prominent left-wing economist Engelbert Pinquo. "Running away to the Moon will solve nothing. Capital, and those who have it, must be brought back to the inner city... by force if need be."

4. "Stone the crows! We're trapped between hippies, communists and soccer moms," grumbles Vice Admiral @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We need breathing room, and everyone knows there ain't no air on the Moon! So let's get it the old-fashioned way - by invading our neighbors! @@REGION@@ will fall to the might of @@NAME@@!"

[b][anchor=257]#257[/anchor]: @@LEADER@@ Assassinated... Almost [Hessinator; ed: Responsible][/b]

The Issue
As you very well know, a masked stranger with a pistol made an attempt on your life but moments ago while you were out on your lunch break. An emergency meeting has been called right here in the middle of the street after the would-be assassin disappeared over a nearby grassy knoll.

The Debate
1. "Oh dear! Oh dearie me, that was so rude!" coos your personal assistant, adjusting your tie. "You'll just have to prove to the citizens of @@NAME@@ that you are a good and benevolent leader, and don't deserve to be brutally shot in the head! The only way to keep you safe is to make the public like you! Do something nice for them! Might I suggest a nice tax cut?"

2. "What makes you think it's a member of the general public behind this?" asks your Head of Security, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It's more likely to be the work of some underground separatist group trying to remove you from power! We've let them have their protests and their rallies and their free speech, and now they've taken it to the next level! We should be cracking down on this insolence instead of rewarding it! Show the people what happens to those who dare to question your authority. You've got to remind them that you, @@LEADER@@, are their Lord and Master!"

3. "Whoa there! Let's not be too hasty, bruv!" says law-abiding citizen, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, casually walking up to you and flinging an arm around your shoulder. "This sort of thing wouldn't be a problem at all if you just beefed up your personal security a bit. You could hire a few extra bodyguards and get yourself a shiny new armoured car! Nobody could touch you!"

4. "Hah! Like that will work!" snorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Minister of Waste Disposal and Sanitation. "They'll just come after the rest of us and destroy the government from the bottom up! No, we need to go even further - reinforce the Parliament! We'll turn @@CAPITAL@@ into an impenetrable fortress! Robot bodyguards, food tasters... no expense should be spared! We should all do our jobs through a complex network of computers so we never have to leave the safety of our offices again!"

The Issue
A man by the name of &%*\@# Smith hit the headlines yesterday when he had his first name legally changed to 'John', citing the ridicule and stress he suffered because of his given name. Mr Smith publicly commented afterwards that there should be more restrictions on what parents can name their children.

The Debate
1. "People do so love to be different," says Insert Name Here, with a heavy sigh. "I don't know what my folks were thinking when they named me. Probably about how 'novel' and 'with it' they were being, but I didn't get a say in it did I? Growing up in my neighbourhood with the first name 'Insert' wasn't fun at all I can tell you! The government should set up a registry of recognised names that are clean, sensible, and non-teasable. Kids deserve better."

2. "It's none of the government's business what I name my daughter," says Follicle Rainbow Gooseknob, cradling [expletive deleted] in her arms. "Are you going to tell us what to think next? Where to go? Who to love? I don't want some grey-faced bureaucrat deciding what name is appropriate for my child! What kind of country hates personal freedom so much you can't even choose your own name?"

3. "Names? Names are so inefficient!" says Five-Oh-Three McGoohan, counting beads. "Who can honestly tell one @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from another? That name's so popular now, I met three people at the mall with it just last week! Face it! Names are old-hat! Everyone ought to go by a government-allocated ID number instead, much more practical. Who could make fun of a child named Six-Eight-Four?"

[b][anchor=259]#259[/anchor]: A Taste Of Revenge [South Von; ed: Kandarin][/b]

The Issue
A spectacular but failed attempt on your life made national news today. Interrogation of captured suspects has pinned the blame on agents of the nation of Blackacre, with which @@NAME@@ has notoriously chilly relations. Your cabinet is divided as to how to respond.

The Debate
1. "Assassins, huh? Well, two can play at that game!" says Warren McCue, your chief military adviser. "An eye for an eye! A tooth for a tooth! An assassination for a... missed shot, I suppose. Never mind that, think of the possibilities! Not only can we strike back at the scumbags who sent this assassin after you, we can turn our attention to... 'manipulating' the positions of foreign leaders and political rivals that stand in the way of @@NAME@@'s glory." He then points two fingers at the wall and mouths 'bang bang' noises.

2. "Sending assassins to avenge you isn't enough!" argues hawkish talk-show host, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The fact that Blackacre is this bold means we haven't made them fear us yet - and a nation that isn't feared isn't respected. We need to do the only thing we CAN do: bomb their cities! Raise a revolution! Salt their fields! It may cost money, but our nation's honor is priceless."

3. "I can't believe what I'm hearing!" says the muffled voice of @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an anti-violence protestor who was, until now, hiding in your air vents. "By building up our military-industrial complex, WE have become the aggressor. WE are giving nations like Blackacre good reasons to hate us! No wonder they tried to kill you - we aren't giving them enough breathing room. If we cut back our military a bit and sent them a fruit basket now and then these problems would never happen."

The Issue
The latest budget reports have marked a steady decline in @@NAME@@'s monthly income. A study initiated by your treasurers has revealed that many of your nation's citizens are not paying their taxes.

The Debate
1. "Damn right we're not!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of many citizens protesting in front of your office. "Your oppressively high taxes are picking our pockets and robbing us of our livelihood. No more, we say! The government may call us tax cheats, but that's just because it's afraid to call us the PATRIOTS that we are! Cut the tax rate, and we'll think about paying again."

2. "@@NAME@@ can't survive when people don't pay their taxes!" retorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of @@NAME@@'s Revenue Bureau. "Citizens may feel that they need to keep all of their @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@, but the government needs it too! Without taxation, how can we build roads, schools and hospitals? How can we protect the people from themselves? We need to give the police broad powers to lay down the law on these tax-evading scum until they pay up."

3. "Scum is such a harsh word. Everyone has something worthwhile to contribute, as my mother always said." says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, controversial social theorist and fountain of homespun folk wisdom. "Even if they won't pay their taxes, folks ought to have other ways to pay back into society. They could spend some time with the civil service or military reserve, for example. And goodness knows, blood and organ donation rates aren't as high as they could be. A pint of blood or a good kidney ought to pay a tax bill right proper."

The Issue
An unusual alliance of environmental activists and garbagemen have brought to your attention the increasing glut of plastic bags that have been found littering the streets of @@NAME@@'s cities.

The Debate
1. "These damn bags are everywhere!" shouts angry garbageman @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "They're in our trees, in our rivers, in our streets, and in our sewer system! Do you know how much extra work we have to do to clean up after slobs who are too lazy to put their trash in a can? Ban these bags completely and fine those stores who refuse to comply! Sure, people may have to remember to bring their own damn bags, but think about the back-breaking labor my fellow garbagemen will avoid! And the environment, of course."

2. "If you can't get rid of the bags, you must change the bags!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an environmentalist spokesperson wearing a lab coat and a huge grin. "Scientists have developed plastics that break down over time, so it doesn't matter where they're dumped. Require that only biodegradable plastic bags can be sold in @@NAME@@, and the problem will go away."

*3. "You're not really going to listen to this nonsense, are you?" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of PlastiCorp Industries. "Do you know how much this will hurt the plastic industry? How many people I will need to lay off? How many @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ I - I mean, @@NAME@@ - will lose? Our economy needs less environmental regulation, not more!

[4]. "Why should consumers have to worry about bags at all?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of an online grocery store. "E-commerce is the way of the future.

No more bags, no more waiting in line, no more wasted time going to the store for food when your food can come to you.

Nicholas Condor, a prominent Bigtopian activist and soapbox orator, caused quite a stir last week when he publicly called for the complete extermination of the people of @@NAME@@, accusing fellow citizens of being 'sub-human', 'immoral', and 'really ugly too'. Citizens Against Intolerance, a pressure group aiming to reduce social inequality, has demanded that the government put more resources into combating hate speech. Coincidentally, another society, also called Citizens Against Intolerance, has stood up for Mr Condor, claiming that inhibiting his speeches would be a violation of his right to free speech.

The Debate
1. "I can't believe we're even debating this," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was present at the infamous speech. "Doesn't it worry you that a man, who would obviously be happier if we all died horrible, painful deaths, is allowed to walk around in public? Let him continue and he'll cause a riot! Free speech is supposed to protect people! But talking about genocide and killing, well... that doesn't help anyone. It breaks society. It drives us apart. Hate speech is a very serious crime, @@LEADER@@. You can't just ignore it."

2. "Words by themselves can't hurt anyone," counters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a free speech advocate. "We don't need to be 'protected' from hearing different opinions for goodness' sake! Oh, what a boring place the world would be if we all had the same thoughts! You can't punish people for disagreeing with you! That's crazy! I hate my mother-in-law, but if I told her so and she then tried to stab me with a kitchen knife then the problem is obviously hers - not mine."

3. "I agree to an extent," ventures @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Domestic Security. "But insulting one person is not the same as insulting an entire social grouping. The wrong word in the wrong place and you WILL have violence on the streets: that's the reality we live in, whether you like it or not. If we want to make any real difference then we need to nudge cultural values in the right direction with government awareness programmes and the like. Educate the masses! Laying down a reactionary law will just fuel resentment in the long run."

The Issue
Wind farms have been set up across the country, generating enormous amounts of renewable energy for the citizens of @@NAME@@. However, there are some who feel that they cause more problems than they solve.

The Debate
1. "Hideous eyesores!" roars @@RANDOM_NAME@@, founder of the 'Not Within Eyesight Of My Backyard!' pressure group. "All I wanted when I retired was a little cottage in the country; somewhere to pursue my hobby in watercolours - but no, the hippies just had to spoil it for everyone didn't they?! This place was beautiful! Green fields and perfect blue skies! Not anymore, though! These unnatural monstrosities are ruining my damn view! They should be taken down and scrapped!"

2. "Oh, cry me a river," grumbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, senior maintenance engineer of the local wind farm. "Just one of these wind turbines can power over a thousand homes each year and with only a minute fraction of the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels! These people are literally in favour of doing more harm to the environment they're supposedly 'protecting' from wind farms! It's beyond hypocrisy and very, very selfish. These ignorant villagers should be ashamed of themselves!"

3. "Perhaps we're just putting them in the wrong place?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, another engineer. "We should be building wind farms out at sea! Strong uninterrupted winds and no local residents to disturb! Sounds like the perfect solution, if you ask me.

@@NAME@@ has been hit with the worst drought in a hundred years; as a result thirsty citizens and a growing number of brown lawns are pleading for a government response.

The Debate
1. "We have no choice but to ration water," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Chief of the @@CAPITAL@@ Department of Public Works. "We can't afford to let what little water we have slip through our fingers. We must clamp down on how much water each person is allowed to use.

A recent severe crash in the stock market of @@NAME@@ and a plummet of the value of the @@CURRENCY@@ has brought the issue of government bailouts to the forefront of the national agenda.

The Debate
1. "We need to do something now! The people's welfare -- not to mention all my side businesses -- are in serious danger!" screams your finance minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We need an extensive support program for the businesses that make our country great, otherwise we might as well join ranks with those... third-world countries," he shudders. "Never mind that all the businesses on this list are owned by my relatives!"

2. "You're talking about doing what!?" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted fiscal conservative and libertarian scholar. "Government bailouts won't solve anything. They'll only redistribute wealth to those the government happens to favor at that particular moment, while placing a crushing burden onto everybody else. The government must instead cut taxes across the board and axe all unnecessary social programs, particularly our welfare system."

3. "This brings up an interesting point," remarks socialist author @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why do we allow businesses to become "too big to fail?" The solution, surely, is to break up businesses before they reach such a size that they threaten our economy. Imagine it: community-based businesses, run for the benefit of the little people, not faceless, money-grubbing investment banks! Is there really a reason corporations need to be big?"

After the recent eXtra-Kinetocam Cartographic Digital satellite survey revealed that @@NAME@@ is a surprisingly tiny section of land on a peninsula of a much larger continent, expeditions sent to explore these new lands have found a wide assortment other landmasses- all with new cultures and foreign civilizations. Of course, now people are wondering what to do with... or about... their newly-discovered neighbors.

The Debate
1. "Isn't it obvious? We must establish contact and trade with these other countries!" the CEO of one of the major mining companies notes happily, gesturing toward the XKCD survey map with a laser pointer. "The land claimed by Stalclaft is noted to contain a particular gaseous resource that could prove profitable for us! Never mind the report also says that the place is a war zone!"

2. "Are you insane? We're completely and totally vulnerable to attack!" declares General @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while flailing at the new world map in a dramatic fashion. "We know nothing about these civilizations, what their intentions are, what they're capable of! Look at how massive that Cea-Dicee is, just to the south of us! What little we do know about them implies that they have SPACESHIPS! We need to strengthen our military to protect against these threats at all costs!"

3. "Don't mind the paranoid ravings of the General there." Noted scholar @@RANDOM_NAME@@ states calmly, while tapping a spot on the map just offshore to the northeast of the peninsula. "We're simply expanding our understanding of the world and where we fit in it. The report says that the ancient ruins of Subspais are on the seafloor here, and I think it would be a most worthy endeavor to study them. It won't be cheap, but knowledge is the greatest resource we can have! As the saying goes, knowledge is power!"

4. "This hippie professor doesn't get it." Admiral @@RANDOM_NAME@@ scoffs. "We have an opportunity here! For instance, this island of Uoeq to the west of us. They'd never see us coming; after establishing forward bases there, we could easily begin a campaign against Cea-Dicee and take their land and technology for ourselves! With that turned into a colony of @@NAME@@, the island of Sekonlif would fall easily, and we could seize Stalclaft's precious gas.

5. "Don't believe these lies for a minute!" Notorious and arguably very crazy conspiracy theorist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ quickly unrolls a chart over the XKCD survey map before giving you what looks like a hat made of tinfoil. "These 'new lands' are all part of a conspiracy by the evil alien Bunny-Knights of Violet!

[b][anchor=267]#267[/anchor]: Controversial Coup Causes Commotion [Sedgistan; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
A coup in a neighbouring country has seen a mercenary force led by retired @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ general @@RANDOM_NAME@@ take charge of the peaceful backwater, purging the opposition, and suppressing freedoms. Despite the new leader making a dubious promise to hold elections, the government in exile is demanding that @@NAME@@ takes action.

The Debate
1. "THIS IS A DISGRACE", bellows Brigadier General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, scattering plastic soldiers over the floor. "This traitor must be overthrown! Gather together our forces and sweep the tyrant from power. While we're at it, @@NAME@@ could do with some more tanks - you never know when the next coup might be."

2. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a junior official, puts down "Diplomacy for Dummies" and pipes up. "The best method of solving problems is talking. Send the new regime a strongly worded letter of protest and encourage them to negotiate. On a similar note, perhaps you could go out with your family for a meal tonight. You've been spending far too much time sorting out this nation's issues lately."

[3]. Noted realist and tabloid columnist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ disagrees. "We should give this new regime a chance. After all, they now control a sizeable economy, and they need weapons - we could offer to recognise the new government if they agreed to buy arms from us.

[b][anchor=268]#268[/anchor]: Don't Want Your Kid Anymore? Good News! [Aligeretha; ed: Glen-Rhodes][/b]

The Issue
A recent "accidental" change in @@NAME@@'s child abandonment law has made it easier to drop unwanted children off at hospitals, orphanages, and even military bases. The deluge of abandoned babies has begun to ravage @@NAME@@'s welfare personnel, and consequently the welfare budget. Overworked social workers, understaffed military branches, and a group of angry women are at your door, demanding that action be taken.

The Debate
*1. "This is insane!" says social worker @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, struggling to hold three babies in her lap. "Whose smart idea was it to allow mothers to simply drop off their newborns like last night's stale pizza? These guys over at the capitol don't know how much work it takes to get these kids into the system and to take care of them, let alone how difficult it is to actually get them adopted! We simply can't do it. If this keeps up, don't be surprised if those babies sit in drop-boxes for days or forever." After handing over a baby to you, the social worker gives one final piece of advice, "Parents needs to accept the responsibility if they choose to have unprotected sex.

The Issue
It has been revealed that many of @@NAME@@'s newspapers are deep in red ink. Opinions are divided on whether or not the government should intervene.

The Debate
1. "There is no real problem here," says noted economist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If newspapers are no longer selling, they shouldn't exist in a free market economy; let capitalism take its course. Who cares if a few newspapers go under? Besides, it's probably good for the digital industry, right?"

"Newspapers are full of sensationalised, makey-uppy events designed to sell more papers and they ignore what really matters - like what we the Government are doing for the people!

The Issue
After the recent, well publicized collision of the comet Maxima with Mars, the National Association of Adolescent Astronomers has demanded a meeting with you over the national curfew requiring all minors to be in their houses by sundown.

The Debate
1. "It's outrageous!" screams NAAA President @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "How are we supposed to study the night sky if our own government won't let us stay out past six? Do you know how many other astronomical wonders we've missed because we aren't old enough? This curfew is suffocating our sense of wonder and stifling our curiosity. Is that what you want, @@LEADER@@, a nation of un-inquisitive drones? You must see reason and repeal this curfew."

2. "You aren't seriously considering this, are you?" asks @@CAPITAL@@'s Chief of Police @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "Since we implemented this curfew, youth-related crime has dropped 70%! What other government intervention has that kind of success rate? The elderly can once again take evening strolls without fear of being mugged by teenage hooligans. Mailboxes stand majestically unmolested. Look, I'm sorry these rapscallions can't look at supernovas and what not, but the numbers don't lie. If a few extra-curricular activities have to suffer to make @@NAME@@'s streets safer, then so be it."

3. "Now, now, surely the two sides can strike some sort of compromise," says noted radio talk show host @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "Considering the statistics, you can't repeal the curfew altogether, but these kids raise a good point: the current curfew is far too draconian. What you should do is establish an official channel for minors to request permission to stay out after dark. That way teenagers – who have legitimate reasons – can be out after dark, and @@NAME@@'s crime rate won't suffer. Quite an elegant solution if I do say so myself.

3. "I agree, but we're forgetting the bigger issue," says Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It's embarrassing really.

Following fatality reports from several high-speed, multi-car accidents, concerned safety advocates are asking that national speed limits be reinstated.

1. "Lives are being lost, and for what?" shouts author of "The Road Worrier" @@RANDOM_NAME@@ at a rally in front of Police Headquarters. "So that juveniles-at-heart can satisfy their need for speed?

2. "The problem isn't cars, it's drivers", states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, founder and spokesperson of @@NAME@@ Automation Industries. "Remove the human being from the equation, and modern vehicles can be driven at high speed entirely by computer!

3. "Cars are only a part of the problem," argues transit advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@, assembling a toy train set on your desktop. "Trucks and busses are just as deadly. We need to shift entirely to railroads and get rid of cars AND trucks – hi-speed trains between cities, light rail to the suburbs, monorails and trolleys in town.

Double the education budget, halve the teacher-student ratio, and make sure every teacher has a master's degree in education. After all, the children are our future."

The Issue
During a recent severe storm, the airship @@NAME_INITIALS@@AS-Hiddenburg caught fire and ended up making a crash landing in @@CAPITAL@@. Everyone on board as well as several hundred people on the ground were killed in the resulting inferno. Reporter Herb Morris' incredible live coverage of the disaster and the media circus surrounding the safety of such vessels has people looking to the government for solutions.

The Debate
1. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, apparent spokesperson for the families of the victims gasps out between sobs, "The only reason this happened is the government has turned a blind eye to the dangers of these vehicles! The solution is obvious, pass and rigidly enforce safety regulations on dangerous industries! Oh, and make the owners of these companies financially liable to the families. I mean, I lost my dad after all, I deserve a little bit of compensation."

2. "Really now, airships safely make these trips on a routine basis! These people are looking at a tiny mishap and not the bigger picture!" claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of Airship Enterprises, the company that operates airships like the crashed @@NAME_INITIALS@@AS-Hiddenburg. "If anything, the government should be supporting the industry through this tragedy! You know, 'encouraging' people to use airships so that they learn just how safe they really are!"

3. "Tiny mishap? TINY MISHAP?" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, author of the controversial bestseller 'Corporations Are Bad, Really Really Bad.' "Hundreds of people dead, millions if not billions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in damage to buildings downtown, and these industry goons are trying to just shrug and tell the rest of us 'Oopsie,' and buy their way out of trouble?! They have a huge debt to the society they've harmed, make them work in the trauma centers and see first-hand what they've done!"

The Issue
After receiving four-digit internet bills, the people of @@NAME@@ are demanding that a free internet service be made available by the government.

The Debate
1. "The only way to ensure internet neutrality in @@NAME@@ is to place the internet under government control," opines @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Minister of Telecommunications. "My ministry has been trying to reel in the unfair practices of these companies for ages, and now public sentiment is on our side. With an internet free of 'premium access' and content discrimination, @@NAME@@ will be the envy of @@REGION@@. Unfortunately, since providing free access would be enormously expensive, we'll have to increase taxes slightly... but isn't that a small price to pay?"

2. High school principal @@RANDOM_NAME@@ says, "The last time I checked, one of the purposes of the @@NAME@@ government was to provide a decent education for our children. More and more students are turning to online services as a way to accelerate their schooling. Online courses offer a wide range of education in academics and work-related skills. But not all my students have the internet, and there's certainly no commercial incentive to lay down lines in farmland. The government needs to step in and provide a free internet for these students. Invest in our future!"

3. "Oh, for the love of Violet..." bemoans conservative columnist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The government has proven time and time again that it destroys everything it touches. Do you want your internet to be slow? Do you want to be taxed up the wazoo, thanks to government inefficiency? I sure don't. Just let the market handle this for once. While you're at it, take the money you would have used on this worthless endeavour and give your citizens a well-deserved tax refund instead."

4. "Considering the absurd regulations we have to put up with, it's no wonder we have to charge so much for our internet service," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of @@NAME@@ Speedy Internet Co. "Safety guidelines, minimum access mandates. If the government would get rid of all these regulations, we could lay down lines for less @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@, and pass the savings down to the consumers. This problem isn't our fault: it's yours."

The Issue
After the growing shanty-towns on the outskirts of @@CAPITAL@@ were featured in an issue of "Regional Geographic", domestic and international sources have been loudly insisting that something must be done.

The Debate
1. "Obviously, the current welfare system isn't generous enough," says mother-of-six @@RANDOM_NAME@@, counting out beans from the bottom of a can. "I have to support my whole family with just a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ a week! It's no wonder there are so many homeless all over. Welfare spending has to increase! And radically! Oh, some people might abuse it, but only a few!"

2. "That's just foolish!" says street dweller @@RANDOM_NAME@@, fitting a clean bedsheet onto a freshly polished park bench. "Welfare payments are enough, the problem is people are too proud to claim them! Look at me -- since I swallowed my pride and registered at the welfare office, I've got more than enough @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to get cleaned up and start looking for real job. Welfare should be compulsory for anyone out of work. Give people a handout whether they ask for it or not, they'll be off the streets in no time!"

3. "I've got a better idea," says Ultramegastore CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "I'll tear down the slums and replace them with my stores. Underneath each one, I'll build a huge underground apartment complex. The former slum dwellers will live rent-free in the apartments, and work in the store. They'd be paid in Ultramegastore vouchers worth, say, half the minimum wage. The shantytowners would have steady jobs and a place to live, I'd have more locations, you'd be rid of those dreary slums. Everyone wins, right?"

4. "What a bunch of hogwash!" says paint franchise owner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "We shouldn't give these people money, and we can't take their homes away. The solution is very simple; paint the slums! A quick coat of Vintage Lime or Tropical Sunrise will transform the look of those shanty towns, and tourists and social workers won't be offended any more. Of course, Social Policy will have to pay someone to add a fresh coat from time to time, but tell you what -- I'll cut you a deal on the paint."

The Issue
@@NAME@@'s governmental revenue has been dropping sharply as the super-rich emigrate to nations with very low taxes. Faced with the prospect of massive budget shortfalls, the government must act.

The Debate
1. "Isn't it obvious?" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@NAME@@'s most famous trillionaire, calling from a private yacht somewhere in the Pacific. "If the tax rates weren't so appallingly high, I - and others like me - would be perfectly happy to stay and contribute to the economy. A tax cut would mean taking money out of a few unimportant things like healthcare, welfare, and the environment, but it's the only way."

2. "There's no doubt we need that money to stay in the country," opines your minister of finance whilst leafing through an ominous-looking file. "But who says we need the people? If we imposed a massive charge on leaving the country - say 50% of the emigrating person's total worth - we'd rake in tons of cash and get rid of the filthy rich wasters at the same time."

3. "Why allow anyone to emigrate?" muses one of your advisers, "All citizens, from the billionaires down to unskilled laborers, are critical to our economy. If we sealed off the borders, we wouldn't risk brain drain or fleeing capital. It'd require a rise in taxes, but I think the financial security of our nation is worth it."

The Issue
After a nine-year-old child died of a heroin overdose yesterday, much of the public is in an uproar over the absence of drug laws in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "It seems simple to me," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a left-wing television host on CSPAM network, as if it were all too obvious, "@@NAME@@ needs to regulate the drug trade immediately. Instead of letting the underprivileged waste their life selling crack cocaine on the street corner, the government should be setting up drug stores that tax each drug, as well as handing out pamphlets on their dangers. Think of the money that could further fund our nation's health and education programs!"

2. "The government shouldn't be making money from people's addictions," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a conservative congressman known for his public spouts of drunken stupor. "While we all like to get a little toasty from time to time, I believe this is a moral issue. We need to protect our children from becoming addicts! Make drug use legal only for consenting adults so our children can at least have a few years off the grass."

3. "I think we got it wrong in the first place!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@ angrily from a soapbox in front of a large crowd of protesters. "Instead of turning our great nation into a narco empire, we should be criminalizing drugs once again! Do we want our children wasting their lives away on crippling drug addictions? No! Ban all drugs immediately!"

[4]. "Also alcohol!" screams protesting teetotaler @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Hey, don't forget smoking," mutters @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from behind an oxygen mask, "They're as debilitating as the "harder" drugs, if not more so. We'll just have to work harder to shut down bootleggers and butt-leggers." [[color=blue]Must not have Prohibition[/color], [color=blue]Smoking must be legal[/color]]

[5]. "Drugs by one name, sacred plants by another," intones His High Holiness of @@FAITH@@, daubing holy oil on your forehead. "The Church has historically used extracts of consecrated substances to open the vistas of piety and bring oneself closer to the Supreme Being.

The Debate
1. "It's written in our sacred texts that our Creator took the seventh day for rest, and so should we!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a devout follower of @@FAITH@@. "To work on the Sabbath is an insult to our Creator, and I think the last thing @@NAME@@ needs is eternal damnation. Shut down all retail stores for the Sabbath! Besides, who wants to work then anyway?"

2. "I'm afraid that's not going far enough," adds @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a high-ranking official in the Synod of Zealous Religious Fanatics. "This shouldn't apply to just retail stores. Everything must be shut down! Hospitals, government agencies, police, and other emergency services. Sure, it'll be dangerous and likely cause some death, but saving our souls from eternal damnation should be our priority. @@NAME@@ must do all it can to appease the almighty Creator."

3. "You're not really going to listen to what these nutjobs are proposing, are you?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your atheist economic adviser. "Think about the damage this would cause to the economy. Isn't that more important than appeasing a few nuts? If anything, we should be requiring that all retail stores remain open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Just think of all that unlimited shopping time!"

4. Slacker freelance food reviewer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, still in pajamas and eating a pizza slice on a ratty couch, sends you a video chat invitation.

The Issue
Following a two hour TV exposé on the growing incidence of whaling off @@NAME@@'s shores, environmentalists are up-in-arms and pressing the government to outlaw the practice.

The Debate
1. "Whales are being exploited by soulless capitalists!" screams infamous environmental activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "These majestic creatures are a crucial part of the food chain. Do you have any idea what damage their extinction would cause? End this barbaric business, or have the blood of innocent creatures on your hands forever!"

2. "Whale meat is a part of our culture," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of a top-rated seafood restaurant in @@CAPITAL@@. "It's @@NAME@@'s staple food. The whaling market is booming! Half my menu is whale! A ban on whaling would destroy the entire seafood industry. Listen, the ocean is chock-full of whales – in fact, some may say there are too many whales. If anything, we should abolish any marine animal protection laws we've got left."

3. "QUOTAS!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your top advisors, snapping out of a stupor. "We allow whaling up to a certain quota limit. We can meet with some marine biologists and figure out a number that both maintains the whale population and allows restaurants to get their main dish. Of course, it'll require a boost in funding to the coast guard to make sure these whalers are sticking to the quota, but what's a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to save the whales?"

4. "It's not enough!" bellows @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the radical anti-whaling group Ocean Overseers while menacing you with a handful of rancid butter. "The government needs to allow armed intervention against these seafaring murderers! We can bring film crews along and make a reality TV show out of it! Oh, sure, some people on whaling vessels might get hurt or even killed, but that's just what people who exploit nature for money deserve!"

[b][anchor=287]#287[/anchor]: Maxtopians Demand Return of the King [Gior Altheriod; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
Some two hundred years after its original removal by a team of archaeologists from @@NAME@@, the Maxtopian government is demanding that the mummy of ancient monarch King Maxbari IV, currently on display at the @@NAME@@ National Museum of Antiquities, be returned to its homeland.

The Debate
1. "Maxbari IV was the greatest king of Ancient Maxtopia," says Maxtopian Ambassador @@RANDOM_NAME@@, presenting you with a copy of 'Ancient Maxtopian History for Dummies'. "His importance to our cultural heritage cannot be underestimated! It is a disgrace that his body was ever stolen in the first place. By rights, the remains ought to be returned to their rightful owner. While we're at it, how about returning that collection of Third Kingdom golden tiddlywinks too?"

2. "Their cultural heritage? What about OUR cultural heritage?" demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the Imperial @@NAME@@ Historical Society, waving a worryingly convincing replica battle axe. "The foreign artifacts filling our museums are vital trophies of our imperial history! Our archaeologists went through hell and high water to get that treasure, and it'd be an insult to their glorious memory to give it back! Besides, have you seen the state of Maxtopia's 'museums'? The king would be destroyed in a week."

3. "Am I the only one here the was taught to share as a child?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Foreign Minister. "We want him, they want him... well, there's enough of him to go around. Let's King Solomon this bad boy! Cut him in half from head to toe, slap each half on a mirror, and like magic, there's two King Whathisnames! Everybody walks away happy."

4. "Where does it end?" asks a notoriously crotchety old man. "We give these foreigners their king back and before you know it people will be coming out of the woodwork demanding their relics back." He pauses to hack something up into a handkerchief. "What we need to do is send a message. A message that will stop anyone else from asking for their artifacts back. We need to publicly destroy the king to let Maxtopia know we won't take any of their guff!"

The Issue
Papa Pallocci's Pizza Pagoda, @@NAME@@'s top pizza delivery chain, has unveiled a new "Leviathan Size" deep-dish pizza. Citizens and health experts alike have come to you raising concerns over the health implications of this new pizza.

The Debate
1. "This is a public health travesty," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted nutrition expert. "There is just no sensible reason for a pizza this big to exist! It encourages overeating which leads to obesity and all of the illnesses that go with it! It's clear that these companies aren't going to do the right thing without prodding. Obviously, the government needs to ban this greasy filth and make restaurants include nutritional information on all of their menu items!"

2. "But the temptation – the temptation is still there!" cries morbidly obese health advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "For years, I ate every kind of junk food imaginable. Just look at me now! Doctors tell me I've shaved twenty years off my life at least. This food is deadly, and we shouldn't tolerate it any more! All fast food restaurants should be banned, and their owners forced to pay reparations to their victims."

3. "That's preposterous!" replies @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Head of Papa Pallocci's Public Relations division. "Our food is among the healthiest in @@NAME@@! We offer an array of fresh veggies and the finest of meats. These radicals are calling for the government to intervene, but is it really the government's job to babysit our customers like that? They're big boys and girls, and it should be up to them to decide what they want to eat! They want pizza, so let them have pizza!"

4. "Hey, man. I have an idea," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an aging hippie, barely suppressing a giggle. "This is all about healthy food, right? My bros and I were thinking about selling this pizza with locally grown organic ingredients and whole grains and stuff, right? It'd be good for you AND the planet, man. The only snag is we're a little short on start-up moolah. The government should totally, like, give us money to open our chain. We'd really appreciate it. Yeah, you'd need a tax hike to pay for it, but we'd totally save the world – with pizza, man!"

The Issue
For the past week, the small community of Greenville in Northern @@NAME@@ has been plagued with an unexpected blizzard. With citizens stranded in their homes without electricity, the township is urging you to evaluate communication priorities.

The Debate
1. "Without electricity we're struggling to get our message out to our residents," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Mayor of Greenville. "The ban on cold-calling is preventing us from calling our residents to make sure they're ok. Cold-calling should be allowed if the caller isn't trying to sell the receiver anything; that'll allow us to do our job and charities could campaign for donations to help with the relief effort. I'm sure residents won't mind all of the extra calls."

2. "That ain't going far enough!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Papa Pallocci's Pizza Pagoda franchisee in Greenville. "People, especially seniors, are stranded in their homes without food and have no idea that we're still open! This snowstorm hasn't slowed our deliverymen down one bit; I've just purchased an entire new fleet of snowmobiles. We need to inform these unfortunate people of our services or else they'll starve! I urge you, for the well-being of your own people, remove the old ban on cold-calling altogether!"

3. "NO! NO! AND NO!" screams concerned resident @@RANDOM_NAME@@ down through the telephone. "Us average folks have been perfectly happy without that darned cold-calling and all of those other evening interruptions. Besides, people are so careless and unprepared these days; it's their own fault they didn't buy a generator and an emergency radio. I say NO to cold calling and I hope this storm will teach those fluffies to stop relying on charities and the government teat!"

In recent weeks, there has been growing concern over the quality of automobiles made in @@NAME@@. Representatives from all sides have gathered in your office and are asking you to make a decision.

The Debate
1. "This is ridiculous!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chairperson of the Association of Scorned Shoppers, while frantically waving a stack of papers. "Some of these stories are just obscene! We've got water pumps ceasing at 12,000 kilometers, airbags not deploying in accidents, and this one guy's gas tank just fell off! I can't make this stuff up! Our auto industry has gotten lazy and corrupt and is in desperate need of stronger regulation!"

2. "I've never heard such nonsense!" scoffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an executive representing @@NAME@@'s largest automaker. "Our cars are perfectly fine! These allegations are completely baseless. Thing is, these proposed regulations are going to make us uncompetitive. Is this what you want? Foreign cars clogging our streets while our factories close down? Get rid of some of the regulations we have now, so we can do our jobs! While you're at it, a government subsidy would safeguard domestic auto manufacturing ..."

3. "What is this? Subsidies? Deregulation? Lies, all of it!" shouts prominent communist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sporting a practical yet stylish red beret. "These companies, they're always willing to sell their ethics for a quick @@CURRENCY@@! They always cut corners for a little extra profit, and look where it's gotten us!

4. A wheelchair-bound man wearing a bicycle helmet on his head, plaster casts on his legs, and an irate expression on his face rolls himself into your office. "Hey, I got somethin' to say," he growls as he deliberately bumps into your desk. "You and your government have been playing nice with the car companies for far too long, and a lot of us cyclists are sick of it.

@@NAME@@'s football fans are outraged after the nation's bid to host an important regional competition was rejected. The reason? @@NAME@@'s football fields are slightly shorter than the international standard.

4. "They rejected us because of a few feet of grass? That's crazy!" writes journalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Sport isn't about rules, it's about having fun and getting fit! When we were kids, we could have a great time with just a stick and a couple of rocks – there were no rulebooks or standardized playing fields.

The Issue
As tourists flock to @@NAME@@ in record numbers, some citizens have begun to complain of rowdiness and invasions of privacy from those visiting from other countries. There are calls for measures to slow the tourism industry.

The Debate
1. "This is getting a bit extreme," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing historically accurate peasant garb, down to the curly-toed shoes. "Our everyday lives are becoming spectacles for the world! I can't even trim my petunias without a dozen tourists snapping pictures of me - without my consent mind you! Our nation's first priority should be to protect its citizens. We need to start scaling back our tourism industry for the sake of our privacy."

2. "That's not going far enough!" shouts conservative extremist and rabid patriot @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "These damn foreigners are corrupting our culture.

"Some are dank, the stucco is crumbling in others, and it's raining through the backstage roof of another! In the name of culture we must restore these halls to their former glory.

The Issue
Following the passage of a well-supported bill that contained half a dozen riders, corruption watchdog groups are lobbying the government to take action against the use of these unrelated addenda in lawmaking.

The Debate
1. "This is unacceptable," says legislative clerk @@RANDOM_NAME@@, peeking out from behind a wall of 3-ring binders. "It paves the way for corruption, eats up all our time and money, and, quite frankly, is exhausting! We must require each bill to have one – clearly defined – purpose and be able to state that purpose in a concise title. That way we won't have any more defense spending bills with addenda about cheese processing regulations. The industry will hate it, but if I have to read through one more schizophrenic morass, I'll quit!"

2. "Yes, these riders can be a threat to the democratic process," begins Party Majority Leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "but to ban them outright is simply foolish. We need the ability to amend bills, and sometimes those attachments aren't always clearly connected. Therefore, I propose we grant the legislature the ability to veto any rider by a simple majority vote.

The Issue
Ever since the clothing ban went into effect, some citizens have been complaining that they have no place to put their car keys. A veritable parade of flesh has passed through your office to present their opinions.

The Debate
1. "I just don't have enough hands for everything I have to do," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a pizza delivery worker and former raincoat model. "Pockets are very important for keeping our keys, wallets, and loose change. Maybe you can at least let us have pants or something, just for the pockets. Besides, it's almost impossible to make change while carrying all this pizza. Please, repeal that law and let us wear clothes again."

2. "Well, I assume you banned clothing for a reason," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who overheard the conversation while emptying your trash can. "But I can appreciate the problem of not having anywhere to put your keys. At least the women have purses. Maybe you can just pay a former fashion designer to come up with a purse that looks presentable when a man carries it."

3. "That's a valid point about purses," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the new office intern. "But I'm enjoying all the naked girls running around on campus. How about you just make it legal for males to wear clothes and keep the females naked? After all, as the saying goes, the clothes make the man."

A fire has recently ripped through @@CAPITAL@@, destroying homes and businesses alike. Now the debate rages as to who should receive the bulk of the relief fund.

The Debate
1. "The fire burned thousands of ordinary people out of house and home!" wails @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an affected resident, "If the government doesn't help the average Joe, then what good is it at all? We need that relief fund to repair the damages! I'm sure the fat cats in the commercial district will pitch a fit, but they're the only ones who could afford enough insurance coverage."

2. "Oh, the wasted money!" moans @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of Basket-case for Baskets. "It was storefronts and restaurants that bore the brunt of the fire, and they're the ones that need help now! Do you have any idea how flammable baskets are? If we don't get the relief we're entitled to, the economy is going to sink. And then where will these citizens be? In a rebuilt house without a job, that's where!"

3. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted anarchist, is appalled at the whole debate. "Relief fund? Giving money?! Now the government has to choose which social class to favor, and here's the big punch line, there is no right choice! We need to do away with the relief fund altogether, slash taxes and leave the people and businesses to rebuild without government meddling. Yes, there will be some 'I don't have any money' sob stories. Boo-freaking-hoo. It's not the government's job to bail them out because they failed to prepare. "

During the last @@NAME@@ Athletics Championship, a massive controversy arose following the revelation that double gold medalist Atlanta Johnson possesses both male and female sexual organs, despite being entirely female in external appearance.

The Debate
1. "How is this difficult to understand?" questions well-known sports commentator @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "There are sports and competitions just for men, and there are sports and competitions just for women; we don't let men run in a women's race, so what's the difference here? And if it's too difficult to decide whether the athlete is a man or woman, then we shouldn't let them compete at all! Fair is fair is fair."

2. "I think I see a solution to all this," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Solutions, whilst solving the crossword in your morning newspaper. "We should overhaul the entire sport system in @@NAME@@ so that people compete against each other based on skill, not gender. Sure, it might be expensive but it'd be worth it if we want everyone to be happy."

3. "We can't just stop there!" protests well-known LGBTQQIA activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We should completely overhaul @@NAME@@ itself to make it less hostile to those like Ms. Johnson! Schools, hospitals, workplaces – they'll all need to be changed! There should be public toilets catered solely for the intersex too! You can't put a price on equality!"

4. "You're not actually going to listen to that parasite, I hope?" your bald, heavily tattooed cousin says with a raised eyebrow. "You want to actually give these monsters recognition? Not only are they going to make us the laughing stock of the international community, but they, and other freaks like them, are an insult to our race.

The Issue
A new religious youth movement, popularly known as The Cult of Pizza, has recently gained visibility in @@NAME@@, proclaiming the "good word of the Supreme Pizza and his light and happy ways". Affronted religious leaders have taken notice.

The Debate
1. "The heretics must be stopped!" trumpets Bishop of @@FAITH@@ @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while handing out black books to bystanders. "If we allow blasphemers like them to continue their preaching, it will hurt my church's revenue -- I mean, it could be hazardous to our nation's citizens.

2. "I agree with the Bishop wholeheartedly, my friend," declares ex-televangelist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, currently your Director of Budget Shortfalls. "But let's take this a step further. We can't let these idiots think that pizza is some sort of heavenly manifestation. So let's hit 'em where it hurts - nationalize the fast food industry.

I mean, at least we won't have to worry about those nasty carbs from pizza, am I right?"

3. At a parking lot rally peppered with delivery vehicles, cult founder and former Pizza Pagoda store manager @@RANDOM_NAME@@ steps up to the microphone. "Don't let these haters get under your crust - the Supreme One will always prevail! There is mush room in @@NAME@@ for a mixed platter of faiths. His Immaculate Munchiness cannot simply be shoved back into his box! Our nation's youth must demonstrate their devotion by dramatically upsizing visits to His Temples, the pizza parlors. Raise your glass of Eckie-Ecola and praise cheeses!"

4. Well-known secularist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ walks into your office, handing out pamphlets that read "Religions are for losers". "This problem all started because we have conflicting religions, right? Well, here's the solution: ban the public promotion of religion! If no one's out screaming that their gods are real, we won't have others screaming back that they're heretics! And it would get rid of those annoying church newsletters I get in the mail. I hate those."

The Issue
A sudden rise in temperatures has sparked a debate over what the government should do to counter global warming, if anything. The environmentalist movement is up-in-arms and has camped outside your residence for three days demanding an end to all toxic emissions.

The Debate
1. As the crowd at the environmentalist rally shouts "Ban emissions NOW! Ban emissions NOW!", a radical who has actually worked in the real world steps to the podium. "Hush now, folks. Do you realize that a total ban would also require the elimination of all @@POPULATION@@ of us? Our mantra SHOULD be 'Reduce emissions NOW!' We must demand that our government install emission controls on all producers, including manufacturing plants, mining and agricultural operations, and military and civilian vehicles. We may not be able to eliminate all emissions, but we can surely go after the sources."

2. "We don't need to be too extreme about this, people." suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an economist. "To lower emissions, all we need to do is provide an economic incentive not to pollute. By this, I mean put a tax on harmful emissions. This excise tax will serve to encourage the use of cleaner alternative energy sources, while keeping the economy more or less intact and creating a new source of government revenue. Win-wins always sound good to me."

3. "Whoa, dude! The government is planning to do WHAT?!?" says famous surfer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "This temperature spike is, like, totally rad. Why would we want to stop it with uncool stuff that, like, makes it too cold for me to surf and like also does some bad stuff to our economy? Sure, there might be some, like, smog and pollution and stuff, but who cares when we could have bigger waves?"

4. "You know, I'm really tired of these hippies constantly complaining about the environment," rants your arch-conservative cousin, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "They're the real problem. I say we round up all the tree-huggers and shoot 'em all. Then business can go on as usual without the eco-nazis protesting every new oil refinery."

The Debate
1. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Population Logistics, believes the solution is simple. "Parents who fail the exam for a license aren't allowed kids - so they don't need reproductive organs.

The Issue
A civil war in Maxtopia, a country that provides the majority of electricity consumed in @@NAME@@, is already causing blackouts in provincial cities. Various concerned groups are demanding you take action before the situation gets worse.

The Debate
1. "Relying on other countries for something as important as electricity is a terrible idea," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the isolationist group 'We're Not Xenophobic, But'. "@@NAME@@ must be self-sufficient in its electrical needs. And if that means bringing back those nuke plants, so be it. We're a lot safer generating our own power than being at the whims of the international market, even if the tree-huggers throw a fit."

2. "Oh, don't listen to that nutjob!" says your Minister of Trade, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "We're just too focused on our relationship with Maxtopia, that's all.

The Issue
Hoping to increase its market share, @@NAME@@'s second-largest pizza chain, De Luigi Bros. Pizza, began guaranteeing free pizzas if they weren't delivered in thirty minutes or less. Since the policy began several months ago, there have been several reports of De Luigi's delivery crew driving recklessly in order to beat the deadline. After a number of fatal accidents were attributed to De Luigi's drivers, citizens are calling for action.

The Debate
1. "Here's a thought," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, environmental activist and committed bicyclist, "These auto accidents wouldn't be happening if there weren't any cars in the first place! If you banned cars from our roads and focused on bikes and mass transit, we'd all be safer, and our environment would be cleaner, too. We've got nothing to lose! Except an auto industry of course. And the pizza industry will probably take a hit too, since it'll be harder to deliver the pizzas. But that doesn't matter: our safety and the planet's future do!"

[2]. "What the... hell does that have to do with anything?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, successful personal injury lawyer and owner of four sports cars. "The real issue is that De Luigi's enacted a stupid policy that resulted in injury and property damage! We need to send a clear message to big business that they'll be held liable for their mistakes, and the best way to do that, of course, is with a punitive class action lawsuit." [[color=purple]Must have a judiciary[/color]; [color=blue]Cars are legal[/color]]

3. "As usual, science has the answer!" claims renowned engineer and futurist, Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You're probably aware that there have been numerous developments in unmanned aerial vehicles over the past several years. Well, my laboratory's been developing this supersonic compact lifter drone with ASM ballistic delivery of boxes, type II AI, PIM, RTP, VTOL, GPS and a bunch of other initialisms that make it perfect for this kind of application! It performed... okay in the test run, barring the occasional cardboard-concussed bystander. So if the military would allow us to sell these things to, uh, pretty much everyone, defense contractors can make a mint manufacturing them; and pizza chains can save a small fortune by not having to pay armies of inexperienced teenage drivers! They should still carry plenty of insurance, though."

You can't change basic biology by throwing @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ at it - this is one area where the women just have to face the facts."

2. "Offering different lengths of parental leave based on sex is discrimination!" yells well-known egalitarian @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pounding on your desk. "And it also disadvantages gay couples. Why shouldn't a lesbian mother have time off when her partner gives birth? I say we offer both parents six months' fully paid leave, regardless of sex. It's pricey, but it's the only way to be fair.

Your country needs a strong leader who's willing to back up their mandates – with force if necessary. God help anyone who stands in our way. Provide me with the necessary funds and give my men the authority to search anywhere they please, and I'll smoke out these traitorous geezers like the filthy rats they are!"

3. "Alright, we were a little excessive with that law," admits @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Finance, "But we can't just reverse it and go back to the horror days of gold-plated pensions. The budget can't handle it! We'll nix the death squads, and the elderly will be allowed to live, but only in our government approved facilities. They'll be given only what they need to survive, and we'll avoid a budgetary crisis."

[b][anchor=310]#310[/anchor]: Too Little Talk? [Panageadom; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Opposition newspapers have accused the government of abusing its control over the filibuster ban, which it can use to limit the length of legislative debate. You have consulted multiple people in search of solutions.

The Debate
*1. "Now, now, my friend," smiles the wealthiest CEO in the @@MAYOR_INDUSTRY@@ industry, reclining in a shady corner, "We simply can't have a few radicals dictate government policy to us. After all, we do know what's best, don't we? First it's this reform, next it's a slew of unproductive economic policies, and then before you know it they're limiting campaign donations. You can see that some issues have no merit, and are simply not worthy of debate. Perhaps we should even halt the debate before such silliness even begins...?" The CEO hands you a wad of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. "You agree. Now there's a good leader." [[color=blue]Must allow Private Industries[/color]]

*2. "Now, now, my friend," smiles an anonymous political strategist, reclining in a shady corner, "We simply can't have a few radicals dictate government policy to us. After all, we do know what's best, don't we? First it's this reform, next it's a slew of anti-socialist policies, and then before you know it they're threatening the democratically elected Communist government. You can see that some issues have no merit, and are simply not worthy of debate. Perhaps we should even halt the debate before such silliness even begins...?" @@HE@@ hands you a wad of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. "You agree. Now there's a good leader." [[color=red]Must not allow Private Industries[/color]]

3. "I think we can all see the benefits of the filibuster ban," says political science professor, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "But it's also true that putting it in the hands of the reigning party coalition is a dangerous centralisation of power. Why not simply have an independent, representative committee to decide what issues are worthy of a lengthy debate? It might be a tad erratic in its priorities, but at least it would give the power back to the people. That's a good thing, right?"

4. "The government, all the way up to @@LEADER@@, has used this ban as a way to control parliament," declares Opposition Whip @@RANDOM_NAME@@, speaking from the Floor, "They're perfectly happy to let debates about the most inconsequential of matters rage on for hours, but when it comes to a serious discussion of @@LEADER@@'s murky ties to prominent members of the @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ industry or policies genuinely aimed at helping the general public, rather than a select few, the debate comes to a quick close. We must overturn the filibuster ban, post-haste. And I think it is clear to all who suffer from this. That's right, my friends, ladies and gentlemen, casual onlookers, convenient family members, cultural attachés, politically active tourists and constituents, both loyal and traitorous to the greater cause; the people. The people suffer the injustices of a government pandering to its corporate cronies, its oligarchic overlords, its necessary nepotists, if you will. They suffer the delirious - ah - deleterious effects of a government sans filibuster, sans fairness, sans freedom! This ridiculous policy ignores the fact that some things require longer and more serious deliberation - as does, indeed, this very issue. But I am diverging from my abundantly clear point, supported by the voices of a thousand-strong crowd outside this very building. And while we might quibble over the numbers - a thousand, I hear you cry? Tens - hundreds! - of thousands, surely? But this ignores the fundamental spirit of the times - zeitgeist, if you will - that we stand against this filibuster ban clearly and unwaveringly. Anyway, a discussion of the genuinely humanitarian policies my party espouses, which require a debate of adequate length for the complexities of which to be fully understood, are quickly relegated as the government trots out its latest quick-fix or vote-snatching policy. Now, to move onto my second point of four-hundred-and-thirty-eight of my first speech - I will, of course, pass over to my comrade on the bench in due course." The security guards by the door notice your discreet signal and step quietly towards the Whip's podium. "Perhaps we should investigate further… excuse me…?" stammers the Whip, as your guards gingerly carry @@HIM@@ away. "Ah … yes, thank you for your time."

[b][anchor=311]#311[/anchor]: Victims Demand Their Pound of Flesh [Frisbeeteria; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
A recent article in [i]The @@CAPITAL@@ Naysayer[/i] has exposed a dirty little secret: prison wardens have been quietly selling the organs from executed criminals and pocketing the proceeds. Enraged citizens, particularly victim's rights organizations, demand retribution.

The Debate
1. "These murderers took away took away our families and our futures", cries Victims of Violence chapter head @@RANDOM_NAME@@, holding a black-draped family photo. "The court ordered restitution, but most criminals have no money. These wardens are stealing the only thing of value these criminals still have: their organs! Give surviving family members the remuneration from these sales. It's the very least you can do after all we've suffered."

2. "We have also lost family to murders and nothing will bring them back to our loving arms", weeps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a member of Victims for a Just Society. "Monetary reimbursement can't replace what we have lost, but perhaps others can benefit from our loss. We must expand the list of capital crimes to discourage criminals from committing any crimes at all, while providing a substantial source of new organs to our hospitals. Criminals can repay society by helping the ailing victims of organ failure. Let transplant survivors be our memorial!"

3. A serene voice from the back commands the crowd's attention. "My children, we cannot relieve violence with violence", intones @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Roshi of @@CAPITAL@@ Zendo, sitting zazen. "The solution lies not with taming corrupt officials, but within ourselves. We should not be killing these criminals; we should be leading them. Our prisons should hire counsellors and sensei to guide them to a better path of penance and good works. Prisoners can return life with life by tending our crops and feeding the hungry. We must end capital punishment, for the betterment of our own inner light. Only then will we truly find peace."

The Issue
Reports indicate that several neighbouring nations are engaged in major weapons programs in contravention of international law and treaty, focusing public discourse on @@NAME@@'s foreign policy - specifically, its position on preemptive strikes.

The Debate
1. "We need to hit back hard at these terrorist scumbags!" roars General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, his face turning purple. "I say that we treat any illegal weapons program by these nations as an act of war! Granted, a preemptive strike will likely cause a war, but if these foreigners won't abide by international agreement, they have to be kept in line, for the good of our @@TYPE@@."

2. Diplomatic bureaucrat @@RANDOM_NAME@@ remarks calmly, "There's no need to go off half-cocked. It would be much better if we used some international body - the World Assembly, say, or a @@REGION@@ tribunal - to investigate these rumours objectively for us. That way we have the international community on our side, and no one can accuse us of playing judge and jury. It will be well worth the extra diplomatic costs and bureaucratic red tape."

[3]. "If these countries don't respect international law, why would they respect international agencies?" wonders political analyst @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Our neighbours are acquiring these weapons for a reason - because no one wants to pick a fight with a country that has weapons of mass destruction. The solution is simple - if we have WMDs of our own, they won't dare to strike at us. It may seen mad, but in this crazy world, it's the sanest thing we could do." [[color=blue]Must not have WMDs[/color]]

4. Noted pacifist and tambourine artist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ replies, "As usual our nation's proud leaders can only see violent solutions to our problems abroad. Wouldn't it be refreshing if they focused on achieving peace through communication and accommodation, rather than force of arms? You may call me a dreamer, but I'm not the only one – wait, sorry, I've heard that somewhere before."

[b][anchor=313]#313[/anchor]: Conscientious Objectors Want You... To Let Them Abstain [Great Nepal; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
A religious scholar was recently arrested over refusing to serve in @@NAME@@'s Armed Services on moral grounds. Small – but very vocal – demonstrations have started over compulsory military service and a citizen's right to be a conscientious objector.

The Debate
1. "Conscription flies in the face of my religion," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Grand Poobah of the Order of Maxx. "It clearly states in our holy book that 'Thou mayest not blow Thine enemies to tiny bits, in Thy mercy'. The devout of @@NAME@@ should have the option to opt out of service. We were put here to bring peace to the world, not destroy it!"

2. "I can't believe you are still listening to these spineless liberals!" yells Field Marshal @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You let these crazy zealots have their way and we'll find ourselves open to all sorts threats. Bigtopia would have a field day. Let's remind these wackos who's in charge."

*3. "We hardly need to be so black and white about it," interrupts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Churchmaster General. "These people don't want to kill? It's against their 'beliefs'? So we won't make them. There are plenty of jobs in military that don't involve pulling a trigger. If they still object, well, let's just say there's no shortage of prison cells." [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

[b][anchor=314]#314[/anchor]: An Affair to Remember? [Nation of Quebec; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A recent investigation by [i]The @@CAPITAL@@ Times[/i] has shown that the nation's tough adultery laws have hit the poor hardest. An odd assortment of left-wing activists, religious leaders, and scantily clad protesters have demanded the government take action as more of @@NAME@@'s impoverished citizens find themselves in prison.

The Debate
1. "I think you're forgetting the real reason why people have affairs," suggests noted socialist leader, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Everything seems more tempting when you have nothing to lose. How can you blame these people for turning to turning to, shall we say 'alternative partners', when they lack the skills to provide for themselves? If the government funded some new job training programs for the unemployed and increased the welfare budget just a tad, you will not only lower unemployment rates, but adultery along with it."

2. "Economics has nothing to do with it. Government simply has no place in the bedroom!" shouts longtime sexual freedoms advocate, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing nothing but a conveniently placed protest sign. "Politicians - who, may I remind you, have more affairs than anyone else - are only standing by this fundamentalism to get the religious vote! You'll save much more face if you admit you screwed up and repealed this archaic law."

3. "I told thee so! I told thee so!" invokes Reverend @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Whatever happened to the sanctity of marriage? It's obvious we've become too lenient. We need to strike the fear of divine retribution into these sinners before the problem gets any worse. A good ol' stoning ought to do it!"

4. "Adultery isn't the real issue," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who at fifty years old is still single and proud of it. "Why not ban marriage? It's not like matrimony means anything these days when you consider all the divorces, shams, casino weddings, and fake celebrity weddings. Besides, weddings are EXPENSIVE. Talk about a waste of perfectly good money."

[b][anchor=315]#315[/anchor]: Creative Flowers Withering Under Legislation [Panageadom; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
Following a record number of affirmative action lawsuits last month, the creative minds, radio personalities and actors of @@NAME@@ have to come to your office demanding the government take action.

The Debate
1. "It simply won't do, darling!" opines melodramatic director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sprawled magnificently across a sofa, "The creative arts simply cannot function without a healthy dash of social criticism. How can fine humor work without the blonde bombshells, bumbling Bigtopians and blustering bureaucrats? And yet I cannot hire them, for fear of discrimination lawsuits. Pah! The government must protect artists' right to freely choose whom to include - and whom to ridicule - in their work. After all, everyone knows not too take it too seriously..."

2. "Why should the entertainment industry receive special treatment?" bellows conservative talk-show host, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "People should damn well have the freedom to insult or employ whoever they like. That's a privilege everyone should enjoy, not just a bunch of artsy leftists. What gives the government the right to tell me what I can or cannot say on my show? Besides, what sane man on Earth would hire one of those dodgy Maxtopians?"

3. "No! You can't let this happen!" screams actress Susan Simmer, infamous for her dismissal from a hit TV show for being "incredibly ugly". "Society gets its opinions about what's acceptable from the TV these days. That's where we need to be toughest about stamping out discrimination! I say any writer or director who won't toe the line should be forced into mandatory racial sensitivity training! It's the only way to prevent decadent backsliding and stamp out racism for the sake of future generations!"

4. "I believe it's time for the government to step in and take control," hisses notoriously shifty advisor, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, stepping out of a shadowy corner. "If we were to hire writers to produce scripts with the "correct" subtexts and broadcast them over state-owned radio and television, we could solve all the problems at hand. We would be employing writers, but – more importantly - we'd be spearheading the development of a fiercely loyal citizenry."

[b][anchor=316]#316[/anchor]: Fortified Against Crime [Praedico; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Owing to high crime rates, wealthy residents of several cities are asking for permission to build walls around their neighborhoods and employ private security to keep the peace. Several advocacy groups have gathered in your office to lobby regarding gated communities.

The Debate
1. "Crime rates in our city have sky-rocketed recently," says distressed investment banker, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "And we think we should be allowed to shelter ourselves from the criminal hordes with armed private security. We've got contractor bids in place for a sturdy, steel-reinforced wall with electrified razor wire and poisoned barbs. Oh, and lasers - got to have lasers! Granted, it probably won't reduce the crime rate in the rest of the city, but frankly, that's not our problem."

2. "Of course it's your problem," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, police chief of @@CAPITAL@@. "If you reduce the crime rate in the whole city, you won't need walls and private guards. Even you rich types have to come out occasionally, if only to take in the theatre or attend a gala or whatever it is you do. Mansion owners would probably end up paying more in increased taxes than they would for private security, but they'd be helping others too, so I can't see why they'd have a problem with that."

3. "Well, I do have a problem with that!" shouts a stock broker, helping himself to a couple of luxury chocolates from the box on your desk. "The rich are overtaxed as it is. Why, I've only been able to afford two new swimming pools this year! However, I think this proposal has got things backwards. What we should be doing is walling up the inner cities to keep the criminal types inside. With the poor confined to ghettos, normal people could go about their business in peace. Just take the funds from public transport or something. It's not as if the poor will be needing to travel any more."

4. "Down with the rich!" cries working-class protester @@RANDOM_NAME@@, jumping on your desk and waving a red flag. "They shouldn't be allowed to set up their own pocket kingdoms! What about the rest of us, huh? We're not all criminals just because we're poor! Most of the rich are bigger criminals than any burglar could be anyway. The police should concentrate on arresting them. They couldn't complain about being robbed if they were all in prison, could they?" While being forcibly removed by your guards, she adds, "Oh, and reduce taxes on the poor while you're at it."

The Issue
Advisers from @@NAME@@'s security services have created a small piece of spyware that they would like to install on every computer in the nation so they can track activity.

The Debate
1. "For the good of all," claims Department of Protection head @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This tiny little program will simply collect data and send it via the internet to one of our databases. Nobody will even notice that it's there. Besides, who's gonna notice a handful of bytes under mountains of stolen MP3s? Just give us the green light and we'll be rounding up terrorists faster than you can say 'lolcat'! And, hey, while we're at it, we could even use it to alert people when there's danger!"

2. "Are you insane?" shouts privacy advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "These are our personal computers; they're not the government's property! The last thing we need is the government poking its big, fat nose into our business. Keep the government's hands off my harddrive! What's next? Brain implants? Leave my brainwaves alone, you jack-booted thugs!"

3. "While 'tis not my place," says Amish farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "I just thought I'd mention that we Amish don't have any of this so-called 'cyber-crime'. Aye, 'tis a boring life, and plowin' gets old, but abolishing all of those computer-machines would certainly solve thy problems. Perhaps ye should just abandon phones and fax machines, too. Then ye'll be on your way to livin' in an Amish paradise!"

[b][anchor=318]#318[/anchor]: Death Penalty on Death Row? [Andacantra; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
After new DNA evidence has proven that recently executed inmate @@RANDOM_NAME@@ was actually innocent, human rights activists have been campaigning to ban the death penalty.

The Debate
1. "This is government sanctioned murder!" chants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a human rights activist, from outside your office door. "It must end! Not only is it murder, but it amounts to hypocrisy of the highest nature. Yeah, keeping criminals locked up instead of mercilessly killing them might be costly, but maybe we can offset the cost by putting them to work making handcrafts in the prison store? Regardless, we have to abolish the death penalty - it's the only right and moral thing to do!"

2. "What about other potential criminals out there?" whimpers @@NAME@@ Neighbourhood Watch spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has taken to hiding beneath your desk. "Did you know that since we introduced the death penalty the crime rate has decreased hugely? I say we introduce the death penalty for more crimes, like burglary and trespassing, and then no-one will ever dare to do anything wrong!"

3. "There's absolutely no proof that the crime rate has decreased", states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your foreign affairs advisor, with a nod. "But I have an idea. If we're going to be killing these people, we ensure it's as non-violent and as respectful as possible; make our executions more humane and give these people some choice in how they die. The international community will love us for our civility and humaneness. We'll be an international benchmark!"

4. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Chief Deputy Assistant Police Commissioner states, swirling a pair of handcuffs on one finger. "We don't go around executing innocent people for the fun of it; accidents happen! So those hippy people should quit their boo-hooin'. Look, if we give our boys in blue some more cash maybe there'll be less room for mistakes. Everyone goes away happy."

5. "Hows abo' bringin' back dem-dere good ol' fashioned lynchings? Bring justice back ter tha peoples!" shouts Jethro, a survivalist. "Who'd dare ta kill innocent peoples when tha punishmen' is bein' pelted ta death wit' rocks?"

The Issue
After a recent conversion mistake cost a government research project millions in @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@, @@NAME@@'s scientists have come to you begging for the country to switch to the metric system.

The Debate
1. "Our measurement system is a complete disaster!" wails renowned engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, brandishing the odd-looking result of a recent project. "We're stuck using primitive and illogical measurements like 'fingers' or 'donkeypower' or 'MegaFonzie'. It's too much! Practically every other nation in @@REGION@@ has converted to the metric system. Think of how much it would help our international communication! It'll cost a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to convert, but it'll be damn cheaper than the mistakes our system is causing!"

2. "Primitive? How dare that lab rat say such a thing!" spits infamous patriot @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "They're not just measurements; they're part of our cultural heritage. Where would we be without our attoparsecs, hogsheads, or shakes of a @@ANIMAL@@'s tail? You want to throw that all away because some scientists are too lazy to do their jobs correctly. Give the taxpayers a break and ignore these eggheads."

3. "This. This is a crossroads." states noted avant garde artist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This idea that we can standardize how people look at the world with words, it's a fool's errand. Everything's relative, man. We need to stop trying to control the world and just live. Imagine how happy our nation'd be with no measurements." He pauses to puff on a pipe. "No time like the present, @@LEADER@@. No time."

The Issue
Following recent elections in @@NAME@@ where the Equality for Vilified Inmates League won a noticeable percentage of seats, the media have jumped on the issue of whether or not prisoners should be allowed to vote.

The Debate
1. "This is absurd!", argues conservative politician, @@RANDOM_NAME@@ "Why should criminals be allowed to participate in elections like normal people? Voting should be a privilege for the law-abiding members of this country. If someone breaks the law, they must lose the right to have a say in who governs them. At the very least it'll be a good deterrent."

2. "You're not going to listen to that clap-trap I hope", says noted liberal commentator @RANDOM_NAME@@. "Voting is a right that everyone should enjoy, regardless of whether or not they have committed a crime. We already punish those who break our law; restricting one's ability to vote is a punishment totally disproportionate to any crime!"

A gang of rough-riders has been policing towns along @@NAME@@'s border, rounding up illegal aliens and "escorting" them back home.

The Debate
1. "Who do these thugs think they are?" asks popular liberal blogger @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The police should be the only ones handling border control! If we leave it in the hands of wild frontiersmen, immigrants will be herded and probed like @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@! It's despicable, it's degrading, and it must be stopped!"

2. "Why, we just helpin' our community, is all," drawls the self-proclaimed sheriff of the cowboy gang, Harry Fjord, as he slides off his saddle to shake your hand. "Matta'fact, we're helpin' the gov'ment as well, enforcin' border control and keepin' yer towns safe from them damned illegals. I can handle m'boys, so don't you worry 'bout a thing."

The Issue
Last week, a jaywalking man was hit by a truck in a busy intersection. He lay there for seventeen hours before a policeman tripped over him and brought him to jail for loitering.

The Debate
1. "This is despicable!" yelps one lone protester, desperately trying to get others involved. "How low have we sunk that we care so little for our fellow man? The answer is as plain as the nose on your face. You must create an Empathy Awareness Squad. They would train people on how to be kind to and empathize with one another. Sure, it'll require some extra taxes, but can you really put a price on kindness? I mean, what if YOU get hit by a truck next time?"

2. "Good riddance!" scoffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a sullen, disgruntled postal worker. "I think we should give the policeman who arrested that freeloader a medal! Mandatory empathy programs? Ha! No amount of touchy-feely 'training' is gonna make me empathize with these idiots. This is just nature's way of weeding out the weak and infirm. In fact, we should cut what social spoon-feeding programs we've got left. Give your good and decent citizens a tax break."

[b][anchor=323]#323[/anchor]: Get Teens out of MyFace? [Malsitar; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
After the abduction of a young blond girl made national headlines in @@NAME@@, the concerned parenting organization Mothers Against Youth Doing Stupid Stuff (MAYDSS) has raised concerns over the use of social networking sites by the nation's teens.

The Debate
1. "Teens should not be allowed to use social networking!" cries the girl's mother, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Some creep added my little darling as a 'friend' on that awful website, and he used it to get all of her personal information and track her down! Obviously, the only sane course of action is to ban all legal minors from using social networking sites! And don't just stop at social networks: block everything else that MAYDSS doesn't approve of!"

2. "Why that's utterly preposterous!" shouts Marcus Sugarmountain, founder of MyFace, a popular social networking site. "You can't restrict people like that! Oh, sure, today it's keeping teens from lining my wa- I mean - accessing my website, but tomorrow it's keeping everyone from anywhere the government doesn't like! I say free up the web, and get rid of restrictions!"

3. "You know, there's always a compromise," says local birdwatcher @@RANDOM_NAME@@ peering at you from a nearby tree. "As I see it, the best way to keep both sides of the argument happy is to remove all restrictions on what adults can view and increase restrictions on minors. But at the same time, lower the age of majority by a lot. What could possibly go wrong?"

4. "What could possibly go wrong, you ask?" panics your paranoid cousin, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "On the internet, nobody knows your actual age. It's a haven for malicious anonymity! Besides, children aren't the only people at risk on the internet. It's full of stalker-rapists and bomb-makers and viruses and sick, depraved porn. We're better off without it."

Following a public safety disaster of unimaginable magnitude - so extreme that members of your government only mention it in hushed voices, and then only in the vaguest of terms - the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ tourist industry has hit the rocks. Commentators from all walks of life have come to your office to offer their opinions.

The Debate
1. "The government has to step in and do something, for once!" demands tour operator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, visibly pulling her hair out. "If we'd had proper railings on the marina, that shark would never have gotten into the oil refinery in the first place! The government has to put better regulations in place to make sure disasters of this kind never happen again. And if we want to coax back the tourists we've lost, we need a whole bunch of new state-subsidised hotels, parks and tourist attractions. Shark-proof ones. Our economy will never survive without it!"

*2. "Why waste more money?" grumbles middle-aged industrialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chomping on a fat cigar, "Look. I'm as sorry as the next schmuck for those poor farmers' ant epidemic. But we've got to realise that tourism is just not @@NAME@@'s strong suit; and that's not going to change, no matter how much the state spends. Hell, if the government really wanted to do something to fix our economy, it'd be to give everyone a healthy tax-cut and get rid of some of that environmental legislation - set up for the benefit of a bunch of tree-hugging foreigners, I might add."

Following a recent fire in the National Archive, which destroyed thousands of important documents, several vocal representatives have approached you with solutions.

The Debate
1. "We've got to face facts: technology has advanced beyond physical record-keeping," councils @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the PR representative for Eastern Electronic. "Digital records are easier to maintain and easier to back up. Our company can facilitate the switch from the archaic paper records to the sleek, new electronic system.

[b][anchor=326]#326[/anchor]: Knitters In A Knot Over Police Stitch Up [Tsaraine; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
After a peaceful public knitting class was dispersed by riot police, the citizenry are up in arms at what they perceive as unnecessary police brutality.

The Debate
1. "With all due respect, @@LEADER@@, you weren't there, so you don't know the full story", your police chief states candidly. "These thugs were loitering in @@ANIMAL@@ Park brandishing weapons! They were up to something - mark my words! Besides, if it wasn't for our brave police officers, who knows what kind of damage they could have caused. We've got to come down hard on thugs like these and ban groups comprising of three or more people. That'll stop any troublemaking, I'm sure of it!"

2. "Weapons? WEAPONS? They were knitting needles you imbecile!" shouts @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the elderly President of the Polluted Slavery Knitting League, brandishing a pair of pins in the direction of the police chief. "The only thugs in @@ANIMAL@@ Park that day were the riot police - protectors of public safety my royal rump! They fired rubber bullets at us without any warning. Rubber bullets! And I only out of the hospital after getting my hip replacement. You MUST do something about these trigger-happy hooligans. Clearly if they can't tell the difference between criminals and geriatrics they need retraining!"

3. "Retraining the entire police force would cost far too much", your financial advisor says quietly, appearing from behind your chair. "That being said, the crazy lady with the woolly hat is right, we do have to do something about this situation. We can't have the police force appear brutal and unruly. What we should do is ban all sorts of dangerous weapons. That way the police force won't have to worry about dangerous thugs with guns, and the public can rest easy knowing the police force won't be able to brutally attack them either. And we can get rid of the riot police too as they clearly won't be needed, which saves us money! Everybody wins!"

With the popularity of @@ANIMAL@@ racing in @@NAME@@ booming, the growing number of retired racing @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ being abandoned on the streets has become harder to ignore. As irresistibly cute pictures of sad-looking @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ fill up the pages of newspapers, the time has come for government action.

The Debate
1. "We're overflowing with @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ here!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of the Sunrise @@ANIMAL@@ Retirement Lodge. "And we just don't get enough donations from the public to house them all. We're now facing a choice between turning away @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@, or putting them down. It's the @@ANIMAL@@ racing industry's fault we're in this situation - make them pay for homing the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ they cast off."

2. "Not far enough!" declares animal-rights protestor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing a @@ANIMAL@@ costume to show her sympathy for their plight. "There's only one reason that @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ get abandoned in the first place, and that reason is @@ANIMAL@@ racing. These poor creatures get cooped up in a cage all day and are virtually starved so they race well, all to line the pockets of some avaricious gambling bosses. The solution is obvious - ban @@ANIMAL@@ racing!"

3. "Hold on! @@NAME@@ has a powerhouse Gambling Industry – do you really want to give it all up because of some @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of the @@CAPITAL@@ @@ANIMAL@@ Stadium. "What we need is less regulation - so we can race the animals more often, and draw more punters in. Besides, the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ love to race - at least compared to the beatings."

4. "There's a better solution to this all," suggests animal shelter volunteer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as she fixes a leash to a @@ANIMAL@@. "There is a problem, but it isn't with the @@ANIMAL@@ racing industry; it's that not enough people are adopting @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@. All we need is a national campaign to persuade people to adopt a @@ANIMAL@@ - and you can set them an example!" Handing you a grizzled old @@ANIMAL@@, she finishes, "Here's Buddy."

The Issue
A naval frigate from @@NAME@@ was recently ambushed by a rival navy in the international waters of @@REGION@@. Security analysts have admitted that faulty intelligence was to blame and are now insisting that something be done to prevent a situation like this happening again.

The Debate
1. "The best way to gain accurate intelligence is when it's in transit," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a communications technician from the @@NAME_INITIALS@@SA, while hunched over a computer. "Think of the information the @@NAME@@ Security Agency could get from telephone calls, emails, radio chatter, even internet browsing history! All we would need are satellites, servers, algorithms, and quality mathematicians to intercept them. It might be costly, but you don't want another embarrassing incident, do you?"

2. "We don't need to spend so much money on technology when we can rely on manpower," says Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the @@NAME@@ Intelligence Agency, while putting on a pair of black shades. "Can a computer gain a leader's trust? Can a telephone stop a terrorist? We need inside men around every foreign diplomat, general and guerrilla this side of @@REGION@@!"

3. "Speaking of inside men…" says an unnamed secret service agent, stepping out of the shadows, "How do we know they haven't infiltrated our intelligence services? Think about it, how else would they know our plans and convoy routes? Spies and insurgents -- now they are the real problem; a problem I can get rid of if you let me launch a secret investigation with, eh, secret results.

4. "I know of a cheaper option," says your intern, lifelessly scrolling through whistleblowing site KwikiLeaks. "Why bother spending so much on the intelligence services here, when whistleblowers from others are posting all their information online? You could just set up some 'game rooms' for bored, tech-savvy kids. Make a game out of finding useful electronic intelligence and reward them with pizza or something."

The Issue
In response to changing fashion trends amongst the youth of @@NAME@@, new recruits to the military have petitioned the government to update the army's dress code accordingly.

The Debate
1. "Permission to speak, sir?" asks Private Third Class @@RANDOM_NAME@@, saluting you. "Many of us are tired of looking the same, and would like the freedom to express ourselves through our appearance, sir. I mean, sir, it doesn't hurt to let us dye our hair once in a while, does it?"

2. "This is ridiculous!" roars @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shaking his fist at you. "If I tell a soldier to put on pantaloons and a tunic, there's a good reason for it - and I expect to be obeyed without question. And who are these soldiers demanding change anyways? I'd like to see them court-martialed!"

3. "You know," murmurs romantic novelist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dreamily staring out the window. "A change of uniform might not be too bad. What if we made all our soldiers wear medieval suits of armour? It would sure highlight the chivalry and honour of @@NAME@@'s armed forces."

4. "Actually, battle armour is a great idea!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, representative from Better Future Inc, dumping a bundle of papers on your desk. "Here's our blueprints for the latest battlesuits that we've come up with. Sure it will be costly, but it will make our soldiers invincible!"

[5]. "The solution is not through technology, but through religion," declares zealot @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as she waves a censer under your nose. "Why not make all soldiers fight in the name of @@FAITH@@, and give them priestly robes while they're at it?" [[color=purple]Low Religiousness[/color]]

6. "Why make them wear anything?" asks nudist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, standing to attention in your office. "Without clothes to impede them, your soldiers can move faster in battle - and we don't have to waste any more money on uniforms. Besides, all you need is a gun to kill someone, right?"

The Issue
The recent boom in the nationwide supermarket Humongo-Mart has brought representatives from local mom and pop stores to your office demanding action be taken.

The Debate
1. "Humongo-Mart is destroying our livelihoods!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the owner of a small butchery, while waving a bloody cleaver. "These chains are over-saturating our cities with ridiculously low prices. I simply can't compete. You need to put a stop to this. We need more regulations dictating where these supermarkets can be."

2. "You've got to be kidding me," scoffs business columnist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You want to punish businesses if they become too successful? They started small just like everyone else. If you regulate or – heaven forbid – ban big business, can you imagine the fallout? Without corporations to compete with, these small shops could gouge their prices. Never mind what capping industry growth would do to the economy. If anything we need less government meddling."

3. "This raises an interesting question," begins amateur philosopher @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why should we leave an essential commodity such as food up to the whims of profits and greed? The government needs to step in and take control of the food production in this country. You could ensure that every citizen is provided with a well-balanced, healthy meal instead of this overpriced slop. People shouldn't have their health and basic needs held hostage by greedy corporations!"

The Issue
Unusually heavy rainfall this week burst riverbanks and caused flash flooding in @@NAME@@'s low-lying areas. This has sparked much debate on how the state should deal with flood damage.

The Debate
1. "We need help to recover from this horrible flood!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a resident of the flooded zone, trying to stop his hands from shaking. "I've lost everything: my house, cars, yacht. There was no time to recover anything before it was swept away. The government should compensate us for our losses. It wasn't our idea to can the dam project, after all, and if I get no help I'll be without a roof to live under.

2. "At the end of the day, they chose to live in a flood plain. Why should the government pay anything at all to these half-brained idiots?" rants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prominent campaigner for lower government spending. "If they want money when there's a flood, they should get insurance and hang the expense. Make them bear the costs of their own lunacy. You don't see ME whining about the whippersnappers that broke one of my windows last fall. Why? Because I paid for insurance!"

3. "These floods should never have happened in the first place," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted architect, with an excited glint in her eye. "They've caused widespread destruction and damage; the repairs will cost millions of @@CURRENCY@@, and this doesn't count the millions more people are asking in compensation. What I propose is that the government invest heavily in massive flood defenses. Dams! Levees! Floodways! Dikes! Dams! Gates! Wall off the seas and lakes! Put flood gates on every river! No, dam them all up! Then build more dams! We'll have no more floods in @@NAME@@!"

4. "You know what? Why don't we use the cheap, easy solution to stop this problem?" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, floating past on a makeshift raft. "Just stop people from building on flood plains. If you're not in a floodable area, you can't get flooded. Who's going to complain? A bunch of real-estate developers? Please! Even the environmentalists will be happy, because the land will become some kind of nature reserve."

The Issue
After @@NAME@@ agreed to host the annual Organization of Really Dominant Economic Regimes (ORDER) summit, opposition parties have slammed the government for planning to spend over a billion Imperial Credits on security alone. They are demanding an explanation.

The Debate
1. Your press secretary speaks on your behalf at a press conference. "In times of terror and uncertainty, it's imperative we take all necessary precautions. After all, @@NAME@@ is playing host to the world and has an obligation to provide top-notch security. A small tax hike to keep us and our allies safe is absolutely worth it. After all, these summits always bring out dangerous anarchists. If we don't arm the police for the worst, a world leader could get shot!"

2. "A billion @@CURRENCY@@ on security? Outrageous!" exclaims seasoned and radical protester @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while recovering from the effects of pepper spray. "No previous host spent nearly that much. This is a summit about strengthening the economy. How does blowing a billion @@CURRENCY@@ on this improve the economy? It doesn't! That's money better spent on us, the people! Our tax money should be going to teaching our children better math skills, not buying another taser!

*3. "What if I told you that you could still have this summit without spending billions or starting riots?" states your IT repairwoman, Leroy Stevens, as he reboots your laptop.

The Issue
After a recent exposé of controversial religious rituals practised by some immigrants from distant, less well-developed countries, @@NAME@@ premier conservative think tank, [i]The Coffee Cabal[/i], has called on the government to regulate these religions and their worship.

The Debate
*1. "These acts are an attack on @@NAME@@'s moral fiber!" stresses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the investigative reporter responsible for the exposé. "There are just some things that freedom of religion shouldn't cover, and that includes ritual sacrifice, the harming of children or animals, or hell, even really bad choral singing.

3. "Dancing blindfolded around cucumbers while carrying wailing children on our heads is a custom that dates back millennia in our culture", explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a High Priest of one of the under-fire religions. "The freedom to practice our religion played a large part in our relocation to @@NAME@@. The government must preserve our right to our culture and religion, even if the majority of people find them disturbing. Haven't you heard of tyranny by the majority? A religious exemption should be made for all the laws of @@NAME@@ to ensure our freedom."

4. "This is a dangerous discussion," writes @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in her popular online journal, 'Religious Watchblog'. "If we allow a religious exemption to any law, offences like religiously motivated terrorism would be permitted. It's insane. I could live with allowing religious schools to decide whether or not to teach evolution, but allowing people of faith to exist outside the law is ludicrous. The government should create a ministry that considers whether or not religious practices are compatible with the nation's ethos."

5. "Once again, only I have the guts to call a problem by its real name," says right-wing radio host @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Everyone else is too afraid to point out the real problem here, and it's very simple; these immigrants and their brutish religions are antithetical to the basic, founding principles of @@NAME@@. They don't belong here, pure and simple. From now on, people who don't belong to a major religion should not be allowed in this country."

6. "The real problem isn't immigration, it's religion," announces prominent far-left politician @RANDOM_NAME@@ "Yes, the practices outlined in those articles are horrifying, but they're no more horrifying than the religious practices the people of @@NAME@@ have been undertaking since time immemorial. It's time we recognized that, as a forward-thinking people, we can no longer afford to allow the practice of any religion."

Busybodies are in an uproar at the design, however, which they claim is everything from "out of social context" and "bizarre" to "just plain ugly".

The Debate

"The trees in the garden spell a frightening word from the balcony; and the tower looks like a - a - well, you know!

"I'm sick and tired of solitaire, word processing, and re-organizing my desktop icons. I need engagement! I need entertainment! I need to watch p— I mean...

The court system in @@NAME@@ has ground to a halt since the record-breaking divorce case of serial-polygamist Matt Trimony, who has decided to divorce all 47 of his wives simultaneously. The case has become so lengthy and complex that lawyer-filled encampments have sprung up outside the building, preventing any new cases from being processed.

The Debate
1. "The courts just can't cope with the strain," warns @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your trusted legal advisor. "Divorce cases have become so complex that lawyers now have to take courses in complex mathematics just to settle property disputes! If this continues any longer, our legal system is going to collapse. The best solution would be to make prenuptial agreements mandatory for all new marriages.

"Not only does foreign money come into our economy, those darned socialists will stop complaining about how badly the poor are suffering. Best of all, we don't even have to spend a single @@CURRENCY@@ on it! We could even charge an establishment fee for each clinic and help ourselves to the proceeds."

2. "How dare those bleeding heart foreigners make us look like a Third World Nation!" declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the maintenance man in your office as he fixes your mini-bar. "They want to waltz on into OUR COUNTRY and make US look like the bad guys, just so they can have the spotlight. They don't actually care about the poor! Speaking of the poor, if they don't have to pay for things like health care then what incentive is there to find work? It's just reinforcing the culture of dependency and laziness that exists among some in the working class. Charity should just be banned, frankly; if you didn't work for it, you don't deserve it."

3. "We can't allow ourselves to be shamed like this in front of the global community, or our own people for that matter", your bedraggled Minister for Health tells you. "We should take this as a sign that it's finally time for us to devote resources to the health budget and establish a universal health care system.

"They use their huge legal departments to muscle out any smaller company that might 'pose a threat'.

"It's our blood, sweat and tears that led to this breakthrough. You must allow companies greater claim over their discoveries. We need patents. We need copyrights. They are the incentive that keeps inventors inventing. Reinstate patents and copyrights or @@NAME@@'s research will come to a stand-still and our country a technological backwater devoid of any semblance of innovation."

3. "The only thing that's clear from this is that SCIENCE isn't getting enough funding," grumbles eminent, if notoriously disaffected, physicist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The only reason we have to spend so much effort protecting our discoveries is because we're so worried about where our next paycheck is coming from. If the government opened up its coffers to eager scientists, this whole debate would simply go away. Not to mention that government could lay claim to any particularly intriguing discoveries..."

The Issue
After their daughter wandered off into the woods behind her house, a pair of teary-eyed parents interrupts one of your meetings, beseeching you to step up the rescue effort.

The Debate
1. "She's only t-t-three years old!" sobs the lost girl's mother. "She'll never make it out there in the wilderness all alone. She's going to d- d- d-" Her husband steps in as she breaks down in tears: "Please, you have to do something! There aren't enough rescue workers out there. You need to hire more or divert them from other areas or something! What's more important than a child's safety?"

2. "Hmph!" scoffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your miffed financial advisor. "The nerve of some people! Do you really want to squander all that money on one kid? If you're stupid enough to walk off into the forest all by yourself, maybe you shouldn't make it to adulthood to have your own stupid kids. Survival of the fittest never hurt anyone – anyone worthwhile that is. We need to get rid of this unnecessary safety net. No more rescue teams. Then maybe parents will actually watch their moron kids."

*[3]. "Search teams are just too inefficient," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Eye See You Surveillance. "Thousands of citizens searching high and low with no promise of success. Now what we need to do is implant GPS tracking devices into all citizens. Think about it! No more lost kids, no more fugitives, no more alibis.

[b][anchor=342]#342[/anchor]: This Land Was Made For You And Me [Luna Amore; ed: Kryozerkia][/b]

The Issue
A recent government report revealed that @@NAME@@ is running out of land for its expanding population. An emergency meeting of your advisors has been called to decide the best course of action. 

The Debate
1. "The solution is simple and something we should have been doing all along," states your Minister of the Environment, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "We have acres upon acres of land that is tied up in landfills. If we compost, compress, recycle, we can use the newly-cleaned land to build eco-friendly housing developments. Yes, it'll require a lot of funding, and there's bound to be at least a little residual smell. People won't be happy about it, but I guarantee they'll be a damn sight happier than they'd be on the streets!" 

2. "Of course the enviro-nutjob wants to clean up the landfills, but that's not the issue!" says your Minister of Finance, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why spend all that money fixing up land that already has a purpose when we've got plenty of worthless national parks? We could start construction sooner, get people moved in sooner, and fix this problem sooner. We could even use the resources in the parks to furnish the houses. It'd give our timber industry a much needed boost. I'm sure the hippies will moan about how that'll destroy a bunch of 'delicate habitats', but it's simply progress, @@LEADER@@." 

*3. "You're all not thinking this through!" yells the CEO of Yellowcake Depot, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We've still got plenty of land. We've only used the top of it after all. Let's expand our cities underground. Look at the perks: there's plenty of space, they'll naturally stay at a steady temperature, and – most importantly – think of all the untapped uranium ore down there! Talk about an economic boom! Sure, people might get a little depressed without the sun and there's always a slight risk of a cave in, but we'll send down shrinks, sun lamps and throw up a few extra buttresses to be safe."

5. "I have a much, much more palatable solution," assures your Minister of Internal Expansion, rubbing his hands together greedily. "Let's expand our coasts. How do we do that you ask? Simple, we reclaim it from the surrounding seas. All we need to do is build levees and dikes and pump out the water. It'll take some serious desalinization and a constant, reliable power source to accomplish, but it'll be worth it in the long run."

The Issue
Since the minting of pennies is twice as costly as the coin's stated value, the idea of removing the smallest fractions of the @@CURRENCY@@ has been brought to your attention.

The Debate
1. "We are wasting MILLIONS of @@CURRENCY@@ on minting pennies!" raves an unusually passionate policy advocate, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while handing out 'Penny Dreadful' t-shirts to all your staff. "And all so people have to waste time scrambling through their purses and wallets just to dig out one hundredth of a @@CURRENCY@@. Many nations in @@REGION@@ have already abolished their most worthless coins. It's time for @@NAME@@ to follow suit." 

2. "That flies in the face of all our time-honored traditions," counters another advocate, this one bedecked in full period dress. "Our favorite national hero is portrayed on the storied one-cent coin, so it would be unpatriotic to discard the penny as worthless scrap. Especially since pennies lower prices slightly for the poorest of the poor. Very, very slightly." 

[3]. "Actually, I think it's high time we got rid of physical currency altogether," says the president of the Chamber of Commerce, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, flanked by officials from various security agencies. "We should just digitize all money. People spend more when they don't see themselves physically handing over cash, and the benefits to tracking terrorists and other subversives are obvious.

The Issue
After massive trash heaps overflowed onto one of @@CAPITAL@@'s busiest intersections, causing traffic to grind to a halt for ten hours, many have agreed that the nation's litter problem is out of control. In response, representatives from the Society for the Prettying Up of @@NAME@@ have come to your office proposing a nationwide beautification campaign to pick it all up.

The Debate
1. "Our wonderful country is being buried by this refuse!" wails SPU@@NAME_INITIALS@@ President @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It's simply a disgrace! We need funding and able-bodied men and women to stage a monthly clean-up of our once-treasured land. We'd pick up litter, plant trees, touch up the paint on the old courthouse – we'd polish up the whole country! As an incentive, participants could receive a small stipend."

[2]. "Now why on Earth should hard-working citizens do this?" asks the Warden of @@CAPITAL@@ Penitentiary, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We've got plenty of worthless criminals sitting around with their thumbs up their butts. Give these scum something worthwhile to do. They'll get to pay off their debt to society by helping clean it up!" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

*3. "It's not enough to just clean it up," asserts the CEO of Showers of Flowers. "We need a massive project to show @@REGION@@ how proud of our country we truly are. With a whole lot of government funds, my company could build the Hanging Gardens of @@CAPITAL@@. Picture it now: flowing vines down the walls, blooming daisies, baskets of chrysanthemums, thousands upon thousands of tourists. Think of the pride. Think of the money."

[b][anchor=345]#345[/anchor]: Mayors Behaving Badly [Nation of Quebec; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
Many of @@NAME@@'s mayors have been getting into hot water in recent months; with allegations ranging from racist commentary to substance abuse, international media are having a field day on highlighting problems in @@NAME@@'s devolved governments. Concerned citizens are now wondering if higher levels of government should step in and take over city management.

The Debate
1. "Something has to be done," demands @@NAME@@ City Hall staffer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "@@NAME@@ City municipal hall is a mess with these constant scandals. The town has basically come to a standstill. It's clear that the national government needs to take over and weed out the corruption infesting the administration. This is having a real impact on our lives - there's a malfunctioning traffic light on my morning commute to work that's giving me hell for goodness sake!"

2. "The government can barely manage their own house and they want to take over mine?" scoffs @@NAME@@ City's controversial mayor on a local radio show. "I've run a fantastic city. I don't want to toot my own horn here but I'm the best mayor this city has ever had! These allegations are nothing more than media witch-hunts designed to take me down. Until such a time that these scurrilous accusations have been proven to be true, I say it's business as usual at city hall."

3. "What's the point of even having the rule of law if our politicians are just going to ignore it?" asks anti-corruption lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while going through your tax returns. "We need tougher laws and more judges with the gall to enforce them. Even the slightest infraction should result in the immediate dismissal of the mayor. It'll probably mean more elections, but it's worth it if it means that the citizenry continue to trust devolved government."

[b][anchor=346]#346[/anchor]: Oils Well That Ends Well [Jarethania; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
An offshore oil rig exploded spewing millions of barrels of petroleum into the South @@ANIMAL@@ Sea.

The Debate
1. "These oil companies must be held accountable for their reckless negligence!" yells environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while scrubbing the oil off a dolphin. "We cannot let this environmental catastrophe continue! We must stop the oil spewage and restore the environment to its former glory! And as for those greedy fat cats who caused this mess, they should foot the cleanup bill!"

2. "Woah, woah... let's not demonize the oil companies. It's not like they want these spills to happen," cautions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an investor in DrillBabyDrill Fund Management. "Think of what punitive measures would do to the economy. It's an unfortunate situation, to be sure, but do we really want to put one of @@NAME@@'s corporate stars out of business? That will only hurt us all. Let the government take care of the cleanup, like usual."

3. "Those are just short-term solutions," says solar engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ with a distant look in her eye. "We should do everything we can to stop this leak AND invest in alternative energy. Who needs limited fossil fuels when you have solar, wind, and geothermal power? Don't you want your children to live in a world free from the oily grasp of big business?"

4. "You're looking at this the wrong way. This isn't a problem; it's a golden opportunity!" says theme park tycoon, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, slicking back his hair as he continues, "Picture this: thousands upon thousands of tourists flocking to @@NAME@@. Why are these people coming in droves, you ask? To see the one, the only Great @@ANIMAL@@ Sea Oil Slick! Throw up a few more platforms, add some roller coasters, a few restaurants, tie it all together with a jolly mascot, and you've turned this unfortunate accident into a lucky break."

[b][anchor=347]#347[/anchor]: Crime Problems Ganging up on @@NAME@@ [The murtunian tribes; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
After a recent spate of drive-by shootings left dozens of bystanders dead, the public is demanding that the government do something to combat the alarming rise in gang-related violence.

The Debate
1. Shock jock @@RANDOM_NAME@@ is outraged - yet again - by the increase in crime. In today's broadcast he railed, "These gangs wage war on our streets, take the lives of innocent civilians, and smuggle contraband into our country! I say they're no different from terrorists and should be treated as such! Give the military a green light, and they'll wipe these thugs from the face of @@NAME@@. It's a drastic measure, but I think a martial curfew is worth it to protect our safety."

2. "Now now, there's no need to be so gung-ho about it," pontificates professor of sociology @@RANDOM_NAME@@ on a "@@CAPITAL@@ Morning!" interview from her luxurious downtown apartment. "Studies show that crime is directly related to poverty levels. These juveniles are just products of the dangerous environment they grow up in. I propose we increase funding to welfare and education to help get these young men off the streets so they can become productive members of society."

3. An unidentified man wearing a bandana around his face and pants twice his size confronts you as you leave the office for the evening. "We don't want you pigs in our hood, bruh." A dozen armed thugs materialize from the shadows. "Why don't you marks just keep out and let us handle our own beef?"

The Issue
A recent independent review into government expenditure has shown that, compared to other nations in @@REGION@@, @@NAME@@ spends very little on legal aid for impecunious suspects.

The Debate
1. "I ain't supposed to be in this joint!" @@RANDOM_NAME@@ whispers down a contraband phone. "Those loser courts went and decided I did this stupid thing and now I gotsa pay for it. I didn't do it yo! I tried to tell those fools that I was innocent, but the lawyer you hired to fork me over totally showed me up. I ain't got no @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to pay for a brief! Who'd you think I am, Hoprah Pinfry? Damn. You wanna make things right? Get e'rrybody 'ccused of a crime a 'spensive lawyer too. Maybe more innocent peoples won't get sent down."

2. "If you can't afford a lawyer, it's your own fault", lectures blue-collar worker @@RANDOM_NAME@@ on the evening news. "It's not my problem if they don't have the money or if they didn't go to law school. If you can't afford a lawyer, then don't break the law. Everything has consequences! Imagine the tax burden it would put on us hard-working individuals. Actually, instead of spending money on this ridiculous notion, I'd much prefer @@LEADER@@ to give us a tax break."

3. "Hmm. Now that's a good idea", says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your education advisor, with a gleam in his eye. "If everybody goes to law school then we won't need to pay for everyone to have a lawyer - they can represent themselves! We should make legal studies a core part of the curriculum, and give some incentives for people to do at least one year of law school. That way if you end up in court, you should be able to defend yourself with no problem at all."

The Issue
Following a bitter civil-conflict in Bigtopia that led to the overthrow of a dictatorial regime, leading officials from the deposed government are seeking refuge in @@NAME@@. The new Bigtopian government is accusing these people of war crimes, and has demanded their extradition.

The Debate
1. Your Minister for Foreign Affairs, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, echoes the pleas of the international community, "These individuals are responsible for decades of oppression, the genocide of millions of Bigtopians, and horrific war crimes - their leader isn't called 'The Butcher of Bigtopia' for his carving skills! We can't just step aside and neglect our duties to their victims. These men must face justice in Bigtopia, whatever their fate."

2. "I vehemently disagree," says defence lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, running a comb through his hair and handing you his business card. "Now is not the time for hasty action. Bigtopia is not a stable state yet - send these people back and you're throwing them to the mob. They've committed no crime in @@NAME@@, and they've come here for our help. Show some decency, and let them stay!"

3. "I have an idea," interjects Wernher von Grun from the Department of Defence. "Amongst these refugees are several top Bigtopian scientists. They may have carried out some terrible experiments with WMDs, but can we really afford to lose their expertise? Let them join our team at the Hexagon, and we'll develop weapons the envy of @@REGION@@. After all, once the missiles go up, who cares where they came from?"

The Issue
After @@NAME@@'s cuisine was rated dead last in a survey conducted by the world's best taste-testers, offended gastronomists have demanded a "national dish" to champion the country's food culture.

The Debate
1. "C'est terrible" bemoans Head Chef @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Saveloy Grande Hotel. "Too many youngsters are eating zis awful fast food. Ze government must encourage haute cuisine to demonstrate to ze world that @@NAME@@ is a country of beauty, love, and fine cooking. I suggest sautéed escargots avec garlic butter. Here - try one. Bon appétit!"

2. "What's wrong with fast food?" asks acned MaxiDonalds server @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as he scratches his nose. "Get a Maxi-sized triple cheeseburger and fries with soda for just five Units. Quick, cheap and tasty - that's why our customers love us. Next please!"

3. "Mornin'" calls out farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leading a cow into your office. "What do we care if some parboiled foreigners don't like our food? There's nothing better than good old-fashioned @@NAME@@-grown produce, cooked just the way me ol' ma would." Drawing a stun-gun and a cleaver from his dungarees, he continues, "Fancy a steak?"

4. "A good serving of sprouts is all I ever needed to grow up strong and healthy" says school dinner-lady @@RANDOM_NAME@@. Dolloping a mound of grey slop onto your plate, she continues, "Mashed cauliflower. The kids love it, and there's nothing better for growing the hair on your chest. Now eat it all up!"

5. A rancid stench precedes @@RANDOM_NAME@@ who slaps a foul-smelling plate of decayed @@NAME@@n Wolf liver diced with broiled asparagus and fermented pig's milk on your desk. "Some may call our customary food 'not with the times' or even 'nauseating', but what do they know? Show your love for @@NAME@@'s culinary heritage, and tuck in."

6. "There, there" soothes your PA @@RANDOM_NAME@@, proffering a bucket. "Our cuisine could use work, but there's so many dishes we'd have to fix… Oh, I know! You can't go wrong with pasta. Why not have everyone eat pasta? Only pasta." A plate of linguine appears on your desk.

After a highly publicized arrest, in which one of the nation's wealthiest celebrities was detained for assaulting two of her servants with a priceless Fabergé egg, some of @@NAME@@'s rich have begun demanding the right to avoid prison terms by paying off their victims.

The Debate
1. "It makes, like, no sense for someone like ME to be stuck here for three WHOLE DAYS," whines Clarrisse Milton during a jail cell interview, only after dimming the lights and getting earplugs for her hangover. "And the trial hasn't even STARTED. My daddy has PLENTY of money and, like, nothing better to spend it on. He could just give a few million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to the victims' families and, um... like, the government. That's fair, right?"

2. "You've got to be kidding me!" bellows @@NAME@@'s Attorney General, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, angrily pounding his fist on your desk. "No one should be above the law, no matter how much money they have! It's bad enough that they can hire some shyster lawyer to get them off on a technicality most of the time. As a matter of fact, we should make the rich use public defenders. It's only fair considering everyone else is stuck with them. You know what, just expand the entire public defenders' office while you're at it."

3. "Instead of wasting money on prisons for violent criminals, I could take care of your problem," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@NAME@@'s wealthiest psychopath, while polishing a rifle. "I'm an unrivaled hunter, but with animals there's no challenge for an expert such as myself. If you sent prey to my island estate, I'd be willing to throw a few electrons the government's way.

With suicide-by-train incidents in @@NAME@@'s stations becoming increasingly common, commuters and rail companies are growing irritated by the impact that this has had on their day-to-day activities.

*1. "We need to be compensated for the monetary losses that these suicides have caused us", the CEO of your nation's largest rail company states frankly. "These incidents are inconvenient, and handling them requires a lot of time and effort; and time is, of course, money.

It's not right that these people get away with disrupting state productivity, as well as the travel arrangements of our toiling workers. I humbly suggest that their families should be held accountable, and arrested. It's only fair." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

3. "I have places to go and things to do", an angry commuter vents in an interview with @@CAPITAL@@ News, which is playing on your office's television. "These lunatics keep forcing train delays, and that means that I can't get to work on time. My boss is absolutely irate! Look, the government should stick cowcatchers on the trains, then the body parts can just be pushed out of the way. No more delays."

4. "People who try to kill themselves shouldn't be punished for being ill, and neither should the families of victims of suicide", your Minister of Health, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, entreats passionately. "Being suicidal is often a sign of mental illness or depression, and our government mustn't stoop to punishing families for having sick relatives. We ought to focus on suicide prevention rather than hounding these families for money, and we would save a lot of lives through education and extending a helping hand to those who need our support."

5. "I'm getting tired of seeing yellow tape every time I go to take the train in the morning. The atmosphere in stations is getting grimmer by the day", your receptionist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, comments absent-mindedly while handing you some coffee. "I think that you could hit two birds with one stone here if you redecorated the train stations. Suicidal people would be far less likely to take the terrible leap if the stations had pleasant music playing, motivational posters, and psychedelic paint jobs all over their walls. Oh, and maybe some pizza joints in the station too! Everyone loves pizza."

The Issue
An IT firm organized an unusual race between a carrier pigeon toting a flash drive and @@NAME@@'s fastest internet provider. The bird easily beat the internet, prompting a debate about internet speeds.

The Debate
1. "This is horribly embarrassing!" cries the pixelated image of popular online vlogger @@RANDOM_NAME@@. Two and a half minutes of buffering later she continues, "Our internet is the slowest in @@REGION@@. Our system needs a massive overhaul. We need to crank it up! Fiber optic connections all across @@NAME@@! Imagine the increase in productivity. Imagine how much more connected we'll all be. It'll be well worth the cost, @@LEADER@@."

2. "You've got to be joking!" scoffs your Minister of Finance, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The government have far more important problems at hand than dealing with trivial matters such as the internet speed. The people of @@NAME@@ have access to the internet. That's far better than most of the world. Leave the internet providers to run themselves and get back to the business of running the country."

3. "Well, this certainly is eye-opening," exclaims amateur birdwatcher, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, with a pair of binoculars dangling from his neck. "Here we are mucking about with our inefficient technology and the birds have us beat! Clearly we need to convert all our inefficient internet into bird-based-broadband!

[b][anchor=354]#354[/anchor]: Subversive Shortwaves [The Grand Dilligaf; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Radio Free @@NAME@@ - operating out of neighboring Bigtopia - has been broadcasting subversive views throughout @@NAME@@. Government hard-liners, outraged by the station's ideology, have demanded that something now be done.

The Debate
1. "This cannot stand!" barks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the Armed Forces. "Bigtopia has always tried to undermine us, and allowing known rabble-rousers to broadcast their vile propaganda into our nation is just their latest attempt to destabilize our government. Immediate invasion and a blank check for the military would silence this Bigtopian nonsense once and for all."

2. "Excessive and far too expensive," counters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a professor at the @@NAME@@ Institute of Communications Engineering. "The solution is not always bombing or occupation. After all, our main targets are their radio stations. A powerful transmitter to jam the frequencies they broadcast on will prevent anyone from listening. It just so happens I have the blueprints for such a device with me. Sure, it won't be cheap, but it will cost far less than a prolonged military campaign."

3. "I think my esteemed colleagues are putting the cart before the horse," says a shifty character from Overseas Intelligence. "It would be much more effective if there were no dissidents willing to broadcast in the first place. My people are in place; just give the word and we can silence this station within a week. Along with every other unpatriotic muckraker we can track down, of course."

4. "I can't believe what I'm hearing," gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a social policy adviser. "Dissent is an essential part of the political process. How are we to know what we are doing wrong if we don't listen to our critics? Sure some of them have extreme opinions, but it's our responsibility to build bridges and understand why they feel so disenfranchised that they felt they had to leave in the first place. I suggest initiating a government-funded study to identify the root of the problem, followed by training for all government employees to ensure none of our population feels this way again."

A spectre is haunting @@NAME@@ — the spectre of the Woodeating Spikeball. With scenic parks ravaged by this invasive species, citizens are clamoring at your door to advise you.

The Debate
1. "The ecosystem is in great peril," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an importer of exotic pets. "These Woodeating Spikeballs have no natural predators here. But there is a solution: back in their native Maxtopia, these pests are kept in check by the Sabre-toothed @@ANIMAL@@. We have to introduce these animals into our forests before it's too late. And you know, since I'm such a nice guy, I'll cut you a deal on the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@."

2. "You can't stop one invasive species by introducing another," scoffs avid hunter @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while skinning several rabbits on your desk. "Just give out hunting permits for these Spikeballs, and we'll have the population under control in no time. You know what, might as well extend hunting and fishing seasons for other animals too. I've been itching to bag myself a Giant Lilliputian Rabbit."

Following the ban on cars, a criminal alliance dominated by Olympic-class sprinters has sprung up, resulting in hundreds of running footwear shops being robbed. @@NAME@@ 's police force has requested that they be allowed to ride @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ as a substitute for their inability to chase these athletic thugs on foot.

The Debate
1. "It's brilliant, if you ask me," says portly Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while enjoying a doughnut break. "Chasing criminals on foot is so tiresome now that we can't have our cars. If the government allowed Mounties, the entire process would be so much easier. We wouldn't even need to put handcuffs on suspects, since we'd just trample 'em down!" 

2. "It's a good idea, but we can solve this using a much more direct approach," muses a tanned off-duty cop. "I mean, why bother with animals when you can still allow cars?

An investigation into a string of under-aged pregnancies in @@CAPITAL@@ has uncovered a new trend where babies are lauded as the latest 'must-have accessory' for teenage girls. Parents across @@NAME@@ are demanding that the government intervene to put a stop to this emerging fad.

The Debate
1. "Children shouldn't be having children", wails @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a self-described concerned mother, who also happens to be President of the @@CAPITAL@@ Chapter of Concerned @@DENONYM@@ Mothers. "Babies! That's all they are - babies! It's all this government's fault for having such a liberal age of consent. It's encouraging our babies to have sex! It's just terrifying.

The Issue
As waves of pro-democracy protests continue in @@REGION@@, with several actually toppling long-standing regimes, your advisers fear the protests could soon hit @@NAME@@. An emergency conference has been called to discuss the looming crisis.

The Debate
1. "We must crack down hard on all rebels who dare to betray our beloved nation!" roars @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the @@NAME@@ State Police. "We must use whatever force is necessary to prevent these protests from happening here. Specifically that means roving death squads and informants monitoring all anti-government activity to shut them down before they revolt. So long as @@LEADER@@ is our ruler, treason shall never go unpunished!"

2. "Atrocities would only give these protesters more motivation to rebel," quickly counters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Propaganda Minister, while reading through socioeconomic figures. "Some of their complaints are worth looking into, if you don't want the wolves at the gates. Establish large-scale public works projects to lower unemployment and things will be back to normal in no time. We could hire people to build schools and health clinics and repair utilities. These protesters say they want a revolution, but I think you'll find they'll settle for a lot less."

3. "The people are angry and fed up with the system. If you want to stop the protests, you must give them exactly what they want!" dramatically declares a protester who somehow smuggled herself in through a food cart. "The time for real democracy is now!" Between screams of pain, as your bodyguards tackle her to the floor, she finishes, "By any means necessary!"

4. "After disposing of the trespasser, the meeting resumes. "We can't allow TRUE democracy. Do you really think that the people would pick a suitable replacement for you?" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your most loyal bodyguard, while sharpening a halberd. "For all we know they'll elect some anarchist with an ax to grind! How about we let them vote, but we only permit reputable Party members to run? That gives the people the right to decide small matters, while making sure that critical issues are left to our Party veterans."

5. "I have an unorthodox way to solve this once and for all," suggests your questionably sane Interior Minister, playing with a chemistry set despite the gravity of the meeting. "Instead of all that 'populism,' why don't we infuse the water supply with, I dunno, sedatives or something?" He grins maniacally. "Imagine how easy it would be to control the citizenry! Put the right drugs in the water, and I'm sure you'd have zero dissidents. Think about it: you could abolish all those superfluous legislatures and make yourself @@NAME@@'s absolute ruler."

The Issue
Stung by an extensive exposé in The @@CAPITAL@@ Tattler of faulty and corrupt elections processes, certain Members of Parliament are loudly demanding that the Electoral Commission of @@NAME@@ revisit the current voting system.

The Debate
1. "What's wrong with a plurality voting system?" rhetorically questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Count the votes, and the candidate with the most wins. It's the simplest and cheapest methodology, and it creates a stable two-party system without any radicals wasting Parliament's precious time. What more could you want? And..." the MP leans forward and continues in a hushed tone, "It's the best way to ensure our party stays in power indefinitely."

2. "Our current electoral system needs only a little tweaking," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a member of the Electoral Commission. "Why don't we adopt instant-runoff voting? That way people can vote for their favorite candidates plus their second and third choices without worrying whether they're mainstream enough. We'll need to hire a few more people at the Electoral Commission to tally the rounds of votes, but honestly I don't see that as a problem."

3. "Now is the time to completely overhaul the electoral system!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chairperson of a single-issue political party dedicated to legalizing @@ANIMAL@@ wrestling. "We need proportional representation now! If we adopt party-list proportional representation with open lists, political minorities will gain seats relative to the popular vote and actually have a voice. The centrists have dictated government policy for too long; let the political fringes speak!"

4. "You're missing the whole point of democracy," argues a strange woman wearing a toga. "Democracy is about equality! The best system of representation is sortition. Go back to the ancient way of doing things and pick representatives from among the common citizens through allotment. People who run for political office are usually untrustworthy and power-hungry. Randomly-selected citizens will make far better decisions than greedy politicians, even if they're a little incompetent. Lottocracy all the way!"

5. "Or we could just do away with this populist sham," sneers Sir @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a landed gentleman. "Do the teeming masses really need to complicate our lives? Institute a steep poll tax to keep workers from voting, and we won't be troubled by the greedy plebeians and their insatiable desire for more welfare. Cut the entire welfare budget while you're at it, and respectable people like us can have a nice tax cut."

2. "We most certainly are not out of options", counters the mission's Flight Director, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We have no idea how much damage that explosion caused. There's a very good chance it blew right through the heat shield. If that happened, and they try to come back without fixing it, they'll be toast. I know for a fact that the military has been working on a quick-launch low-Earth orbiter. If we refit it as a rescue vehicle and launch now, we can have them down safely by the weekend."

3. "Are you out of your mind!?" screams Major General @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while taking a swing at the Flight Director. "That spacecraft is top secret. Want me to slow it down for you? Top. Secret. You want to use it in a high-profile, never before done space rescue?

As for the astronauts, let them find their own ride home. We're not the only country with a space program you know."

4. "You reap what you sow", chastises Reverend @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Tell me, what happened when the people of Babel tried to build a tower to God? He destroyed it and punished them. This shuttle is simply a modern day Tower of Babel in spades. You mocked God with your pride, tried to defile his celestial kingdom with your sinful machines, and now you will pay the price.

1. "The city is a warzone!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the city's Mayor. "Bodies lining the streets, buildings collapsing – it's an inferno!

3. "Woah, hold up a second", interrupts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Director of @@NAME@@'s Emergency Preparedness Agency while nervously wringing a fire-safety pamphlet.

The Issue
A period of unprecedented peace and prosperity in @@NAME@@ has seen your personal approval rate sky-rocket. Recently, a small but growing movement has emerged claiming that these general good times are the result of your divine favour, and are advocating that the people worship you as a god.

The Debate
1. "All hail the glorious @@LEADER@@, giver of safety and wealth!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Prefect of the Cult of Divine Nationalism from atop a wooden crate in @@CAPITAL@@ Grand Plaza. "Are not the might and benevolence of the holy @@LEADER@@ manifest for all to see? Should we not respond in humble worship? Proclaim your divinity before all, O Great One, and your people shall listen!"

2. "This is heresy!" pontificates @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a high-ranking clergywoman of @@RELIGION@@, while proffering a collection plate. "Surely you can't seriously be entertaining delusions of divinity? You would undoubtedly bring divine wrath upon us! I urge you, speak out against these wayward souls and endorse the teachings of our holy writ as the true path to righteousness. Only then can we be assured of continued providence."

3. "Let's not be too hasty now, there may be an opportunity in this," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your shrewdest political advisors. "Of course you're not divine, we both know that, but is there really any harm in letting these whack-jobs think you are? Nothing begets obedience like the command of one's god, after all. Perhaps a carefully constructed public statement is in order, one that gives legitimacy to these people's beliefs while avoiding claiming divinity outright. Let people read into it what they want, and if they flock to this 'religion' in droves, well, would it really be so terrible if a large percentage of @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ became your devoted disciples?

4. "Bah! Ridiculous gobbledygook, all of it!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, controversial atheist author of the book 'Atoms in Space and Relations Between Them - An Exhaustive Account of Existence'. "These cultists are no crazier than any other religious types, and have done far less damage than some I might mention. Take this opportunity to disavow all religion as superstitious nonsense, and throw your support behind reason instead. It's the perfect opportunity to end the tax breaks for people with imaginary friends, and funnel that additional money into the areas it can do some real good, like authors of popular science books!"

5. "All hail our glorious @@LEADER@@... or face eternal punishment!" shouts a wide-eyed bearded man in sack cloth waving a greasy tract. "Pay no heed to these sectarians, my liege, they have departed from the way of truth! Only we, of the Cult of Nationalist Divinity, have remained faithful in the face of their slanderous impiety. We know you to be an uncompromising and demanding god, intolerant of all false doctrine. We stand ready to convert the masses to your worship, by force if necessary!

1. "I'm appalled these religious wackos have the gall to even think about banning birth control," @@RANDOM_NAME@@ says to you. "These men are trying to control our bodies. They treat us like we're their own personal baby dispensers — not living, thinking humans. It's demeaning! My body, my choice!"

3. "Both sides have rocks in their brains," says proud asexual, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why don't we just ban sex altogether, and force people to use artificial insemination? That way, we can preview everyone who signs up to have kids, and if we don't like it, tough beans for them.

4. "Last I checked, free speech meant listening to people you didn't like," yawns your advisor, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, slouched over a sofa with a newspaper over his face. "A principle your office seems utterly devoted to... Look. Should a bunch of bigoted nutjobs stop homosexuals from saying it's alright for Jim and Jones to hold hands in the street? Of course not. Equally, should a bunch of tarted-up fruits stop reactionaries from banging on about their beliefs? Obviously no. So why stop either of them? Freedom of expression is more important than either party's sensibilities, no matter how distasteful that might be."

5. "This whole culture is foul, and we shouldn't perpetuate it," argues daily commuter, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "Surely the point of public transportation is to quickly get people to work or wherever, not to bombard them with fringe political causes.

"They demean the heroic actions of veterans who did actually earn the medals, and desecrate the memory of those who died in service of @@NAME@@.

Labor organizations are outraged by the practice of unpaid internships following the death of a student intern who worked hundred-hour weeks, desperately trying to get ahead in the finance industry. The unions are demanding the end of unpaid employment.

The Debate
1. "I can't believe the government is allowing this barbaric practice to continue in @@NAME@@!" shouts student union leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@ into a megaphone. "We work long hours doing tedious work for no pay. It's pure corporate exploitation. I'd hardly call alphabetizing papers or washing a CEO's feet valuable work experience.

"We provide our sla- I mean interns with the most glamorous work that the industry has to offer. They are a great asset to our company. Sure, they might not get paid, but we offer them valuable work experience that they can't get anywhere else. And if they work hard, we even give them a reference. What's wrong with that?"

3. "Why bother with internships at all?" muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an economics advisor, while lazily checking stock options. "The real solution would be to abolish the minimum wage and allow each company to set their own standards. Then you'll see what jobs are really worth in @@NAME@@.

4. "MORE deregulation?" snaps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your student intern, for once taking a break from filing your papers. "As if @@NAME@@ wasn't capitalist enough. Fixing economic exploitation is going to take a lot more than outlawing internships. Stop the bourgeoisie from leeching off of everyone's labor, and us workers could finally go to work knowing our hours of toil were actually building society.

After the sudden withdrawal of a large portion of the government's budget led to the overnight collapse of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ economy, panicked - and now jobless - bureaucrats have flocked to your office demanding a swift U-turn in government policy.

The Debate
1. "Yes! Re-institute the subsidies," implores former civil servant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, searching behind your desk for loose change. "If we act now, there's still a chance we can raise the money needed to save our economy - and my career!"

2. "You've got to be kidding me," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head - and last remaining employee - of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Revenue Agency, recently voted most popular person in @@NAME@@. "Did you see the look on our citizens' faces when we slashed taxes? Give them even more control over their economic futures, and the economy will surely recover in time."

3. "The ECONOMY has collapsed?!?" splutters a near-hysterical @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You need some perspective - our entire public sector has been devastated overnight! Millions left destitute, without education, healthcare or pensions. Rather than cosying up to business again, we urgently need a restoration of the welfare budgets you callously axed!"

[b][anchor=371]#371[/anchor]: Lotto Fever [Nation of Quebec; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Your ever-enterprising brother was recently arrested for running a surprisingly large numbers racket; the earnings allowed him to purchase several foreign luxury cars. Your advisers, surprised by gambling's potential profitability, have begun debating the possibility of a National Lottery to raise government funds. The idea has drawn fire from social groups, who have come to warn you of the evils of gambling.

The Debate
1. "A National Lottery would be a great idea," says your money-obsessed Minister of Finance, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "This is just what the economy needs. Everybody is attracted to the idea of becoming a millionaire overnight. And best of all, this is as close as you can get to taxing the poor without actually calling it that! That surplus could even subsidize our struggling strategic basket weaving sector. A government-owned lottery would permit small games of chance while keeping out the sleazy, parasitic casinos."

2. "A gambling ban is essential to the moral fibre of the nation," counters social worker, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing a t-shirt with the slogan 'Don't be a Fool; Gambling's not Cool'. "Gambling addiction causes countless broken homes abroad, and having a national lottery would only introduce the problem into @@NAME@@. For the sake of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ families, we MUST stand firm against the sin of gambling!"

*3. A man sporting a ten-gallon cowboy hat rolls in an impressive scale model of a casino city, complete with a flashing neon light display. "Well howdy folks! I couldn't help but overhear that your gambling industry is in the toilet. Why not hand over the new lottery to the private sector? I have a plan to use that lottery money to create massive casino cities. I've built casinos in Maxtopia, Bigtopia, and North Lilliputia and by gum, it put them on the map! Just think of all the tourists who will flock to @@NAME@@: The Gambling Center of @@REGION@@!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. A man sporting a ten-gallon cowboy hat rolls in an impressive scale model of a casino city, complete with a flashing neon light display. "Well howdy folks! I couldn't help but overhear that your gambling industry is in the toilet. That's the problem with you commies: you don't know how to generate a profit. Why not allow the private sector back into your nation's economy and celebrate that with turning over the lottery to my company? I have a plan to use that lottery money to create massive casino cities. I've built casinos in Maxtopia, Bigtopia, and North Lilliputia and by gum, it put them on the map! Just think of all the tourists who will flock to @@NAME@@: The Gambling Center of @@REGION@@!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

5. "And why are we letting some guy with a ridiculous hat profit from this new industry?" exclaims your brother, who was not invited to this meeting. "We'd be much better off with a government monopoly of all gambling institutions, so the profits don't all end up in that foreigner's bank account. But instead of wasting that sweet, sweet lolly on a basketcase subsidization plan, imagine the fun WE could have. You know, for a world leader, your digs are kinda shabby. What's say we use that gambling money for your own personal pleasure palace? It would be all for you. And family of course."

[b][anchor=372]#372[/anchor]: The Coming of the Commissars [Baiynistan; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Controversy arose recently when an entire platoon deserted because they "just didn't see the point of it all". As a consequence, debate has erupted over ways to rebuild Revolutionary spirit in the army.

The Debate
1. "The answer is simple, Leader," confidently states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Party ideologue. "Our servicemen and women need to know what they're fighting for: the Historical mission of @@NAME@@. It's absolutely imperative that we appoint political commissars to serve alongside regular officers and educate our brave soldiers about Worldwide Revolution. Ideological training is as important as the ability to shoot straight, after all."

2. "No, no, no! That all sounds frightfully dull!" interrupts your wild-eyed and unkempt head of sciences, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You know what'll get young people lining up at every recruitment post? Flashy new gear! Who doesn't want to charge into battle as a combat engineer, dodging and weaving between @@ANIMAL@@ tanks, airships raining down support? Oh, and Tesla coils, gotta have Tesla coils. I admit the R&D will be INSANELY expensive, and I can't guarantee realization of all our schematics - especially the time machine side project - but hey, at least it'll solve the morale problem."

3. "Now hold on just a minute!" hollers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an unruly off-duty soldier. "We don't need some jumped-up Party mouthpiece telling us what to do! Present company excepted, of course, @@LEADER@@. And we don't need fancy gizmos to motivate us either. The real problem is the officer corps forcing us to fight all the time. War takes so much effort and somebody always ends up getting hurt. If we have the troops elect officers at every level - including the top brass - we won't be fighting pointless battles in the first place. After all, isn't workers' power what the Revolution is all about?"

4. "An entire platoon just DESERTED!" fumes former Gulag Welfare Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while visiting on diplomatic business, "And no one thinks they should be punished? In Glorious Motherland such treachery would never be tolerated," he continues, mindlessly toying with a pistol, "It sounds to me that you need some men following around your conscripts to make sure the cowards don't flee back to mommy. You don't want @@NAME@@ to become the laughingstock of the anticapitalist world."

[b][anchor=373]#373[/anchor]: Devil and the Deep Blue Funding Gap [New Vegas; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A group of scientists have come to your office hoping for grants to explore the deep blue sea.

The Debate
1. "Our lack of knowledge of the ocean is unacceptable!" lectures Jacques Zissou, Emeritus Professor of Marine Biology. "We know less about the ocean floor than we do the lunar surface. The dearth of research is absurd! Were the government to provide more funding, we could perform studies on marine life, underwater volcanoes, currents, and more. The possibilities are endless. Sure, it'll cost a pretty @@CURRENCY@@, but the dissertations will be enthralling."

2. "Oh sure, let's spend millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to find out what's in the ocean. Oh wait, I can already tell you: it's just WATER," your budget advisor remarks sarcastically. "There is no point in spending tax money to know what kind of dirt is on the ocean floor. The government should scrap all research projects designed without real economic benefit. The last thing @@NAME@@ needs is yet another harebrained scheme to study the mating habits of dolphins or something comparably ridiculous."

[b][anchor=374]#374[/anchor]: Lion Dad Sparks Child-Rearing Sentiment [Samuelica; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
The controversial book "Battle Hymn of the Lion Dad", which depicts a foreign-born father brutally raising his children to outperform their peers, has whipped up a great debate over parenting in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "Look at @@NAME@@'s children: fat, lazy, dumb, and unsuccessful," says the book's author @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@. "Now look at my two girls. Attending top colleges! Lawyer and doctor! Making a difference with their lives! Making good money with their lives! It takes iron discipline, regular beatings, and the sacrifice of their childhoods, and I might not remember their names every once in a while, but who cares about that when I can brag about my boys - I mean girls."

2. "Poor babies," wails concerned mother @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, clutching her teenage son tight to her bosom. "That book suggests the most awful punishments - hit our children, starve them, make them do their homework. The worst thing I ever did to my cupcake was give him a little gold star for trying his best. I suggest we ban this book and while we are at it, lengthen the school holidays so I can take my huggle-bug to Mr Happy's Funland again."

3. "It's not my fault," yawns exhausted warehouse operative and father of four @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, after returning from a double shift, "All I ever learned at school was how to calculate a hypotenuse and how an oxbow lake is formed. Why not teach young @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ some useful life skills like raising kids, getting a job, and coping with the daily grind of life? It's all they have to look forward to, after all." He immediately falls asleep on the couch.

4. "Lion dad?" queries @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, grasping his young son under one arm, while feeding a ferocious @@ANIMAL@@ from the other. "That's actually just what our kids need these days - a taste of the wild. All newborn children should be left in the wilderness to fend for themselves. The strong and resourceful will survive to better our nation, and the weak... well at least the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ won't go hungry."

[b][anchor=375]#375[/anchor]: [color=goldenrod]Easter Egg[/color]: Keep Your Hands Off Those Lucky Charms! [Vile Island; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
The sudden appearance of a bouquet of rainbows in the skies above @@CAPITAL@@ has bedazzled the city's natives. Initial investigations by amateur scientists have revealed the source of the phenomena to be a previously undiscovered ancient barrow just outside the city limits, apparently teeming with hoards of gold. Efforts to procure the gold, however, have been in vain, with rumours that mysterious men of a limited stature are mischievously playing tricks on would-be treasure hunters.

The Debate
1. "This is spectacular", squeals @@RANDOM_NAME@@, presenter of popular entertainment show 'Us Nightly'. "All this GOLD for FREE! I can think of a thousand ways to spend it all. So what if there are a few weird dwarves - we could use all of this gold to fund the national budget! Let's blow that ditch to hell, grab the loot, and go on a shopping spree!"

2. "Gold? Dwarves? Rainbows? This is a travesty!" decrees @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an infamous mendicant preacher who wandered into a live report on the lunchtime news. "These are no mere dwarves - these are leprechauns; demons sent here to deceive us! They are wicked, sinful tricksters, who have become manifest because of our tolerance of ancient pagan burial grounds on our sacred and holy lands. We must purge these abominations and destroy all that which is connected to this Plague; the leprechauns, their evil gold, and that unholy barrow!"

3. "Top o' the morning to you laddie!" says Patrick O'Malley, a twinkley-eyed leprechaun, all clad in green. "Ara, let's not be talking about blowing up this and blowing up that. Sure we'd just love to be friends, you and I and us. Now look a chara, how's about we come to a wee deal, aye? We'll swap some of our lucky Irish gold for a couple o'drops to drink. We do be dying of the thirst and wouldn't say no to an aul whiskey or two ... dozen. Just between us, mind! Our wee secret."

[b][anchor=376]#376[/anchor]: Death by Bungee [Canckaland; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
The @@CAPITAL@@ Times recently reported that @@NAME@@ leads @@REGION@@ in deaths from bungee jumping. In response, a handful of advocates have petitioned your office to remedy the unusual situation.

The Debate
1. "Bungee jumping is all good fun," says Bunga Bunga Bungee Business Bund Bigwig Bernard Bungalow. "It would be criminal to criminalize such a rewarding, family-friendly activity. All the members of my organization have stellar records of safety, unlike the fools at Bungee Bonanza. I mean come on, what kind of idiot uses a 50 meter bungee for a 30 meter cliff? So to distance reputable businessmen from their corner-cutting counterparts, the government should publish a list of accredited bungee institutions to help jumpers to make informed choices."

2. "Bungee jumping is insane," argues @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who always wears a helmet, just in case. "My cousin split his head open while bungee jumping. Our entire family was devastated. The only reasonable solution is to ban dangerous activities like bungee jumping, skydiving, oh - and anything involving scissors." Sipping from a glass of pasteurized water, he continues, "Some people may complain it's ruining their fun, but as I like to tell them, it's hard to have fun when you're dead, eh!"

3. "Let's not cry over spilt milk," says funeral home director @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, rubbing her hands with barely-disguised glee. "As for the few deaths, at least they perished doing something they enjoyed. To be honest, I don't know why @@NAME@@ needs all these pansy safety regulations." She pushes a stack of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ towards you. "Let them go splat!"

The Issue
A military courier, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, rushes into your office in a panic, "@@LEADER@@, there's been a terrible tragedy! We mistook a civilian aircraft for an attack bomber and launched an anti-aircraft missile at it. There are no survivors. What should we do?"

The Debate
1. "Blame the Bigtopians!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your most jingoistic advisor. "No one can really prove it was us. Pin it on our foes and prove to the world how monstrous they are. It's the perfect excuse to double-down on our military investments. How else can we possibly defend ourselves against such amoral villains?" 

2. "What did you expect to happen?" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leader of @@NAME@@ Against Arms. "You can hardly walk down the street without seeing a soldier on their front-porch polishing a surface-to-air missile. With all of these weapons in the government's hands, of course accidents are going to happen. The only way to prevent an awful war is to openly admit our mistake and massively cut back on the number of weapons in circulation. That will keep this tragedy from ever happening again." 

3. "How do we even know it was a civilian aircraft?" insinuates Chief Spy L------. "We could just quietly let the word out that it was actually a secret military aircraft sent in by the Bigtopians to spy on us, and no one could blame us for shooting it down. Clearly the numerous schoolchildren and nuns were just clever disguises meant to fool us." 

4. "Deny, deny, deny," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Deputy Minister of Information. "We didn't shoot down a plane because there was no plane. There are no corpses because no one was on the plane - which didn't exist anyway. Anyone who says otherwise is clearly just slandering the Glorious @@TYPE@@ of @@NAME@@."

[b][anchor=378]#378[/anchor]: The War To End All Wars [Golgothastan; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
It's the centenary of a great war that shook @@REGION@@, and competing plans to commemorate the historic moment are being considered for approval.

The Debate
1. "No expense must be spared!" shouts military historian @@RANDONMALENAME@@ through his unfashionable mustache. "This historic event must be celebrated through every town square in the country. Parades, street parties, reenactments! I'm sure all our citizens will contribute handsomely to making this celebration truly memorable."

2. "Excellent! And let's not stop with the past," proclaims Brigadier-General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Director of Public Outreach for the Army. "We can use this burst of patriotic fervor to give a strong message of support to today's armed forces, going forward. We should have a big parade of our men and women in uniform in @@CAPITAL@@ with a fly-by from the Air Force. We can never have too many recruits, after all."

3. "Do you have any idea how much all of that would cost?" complains budget auditor @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while eating a stale rice cracker for lunch. "We shouldn't spend money on something that happened a hundred years ago, and the savings from all that pomp and circumstance can be returned to the taxpayers. Are you going to eat that sandwich?"

4. "I don't mind having a commemoration, but we need to remember that most of the people who died in the Great War were common workers like me," says union leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who never seems to be content with anything. "I think it's only fair that we give everyone a national holiday, so we can all reflect upon our history of class oppression. Otherwise celebrations like this end up just being for you toffs."

5. "Of course we should remember the War - but there was nothing 'Great' about it!" pontificates student protester @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has read two and a half books about the War and now knows everything about it. "It was a shameful bloodbath caused by greedy capitalist arms manufacturers, and it could have been avoided. We should be remembering the incalculable tragedy of it all and making sure it never happens again!"

The Issue
With global travel soaring, the country's primary airport, @@CAPITAL@@ International, has reached full capacity. Interested parties are queuing up to share their thoughts on what should be done.

The Debate
1. "We won't be 'International' for long without a capacity increase," laments Transport Minister @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ while wringing her hands. "If we want to remain a global hub, we need another runway and we need it now. We'll have to bulldoze a few houses to clear room, but just think of the @@CURRENCY@@ we'll make from all those passengers."

2. "Our quality of life is what matters," bellows nearby resident @@RANDOM_NAME@@ over the noise of a landing jet. "Why do we even want to be a hub, with all that noise and pollution? What we need is even stricter limits on planes flying over residential areas. And if that means a few planes have to land elsewhere, then much the better."

3. "There's no need to destroy people's lives just for a new runway", parries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Under-Secretary of State for Creative Solutions, "but nor do we need to turn planes away. Why not build an entirely new airport, in the Orilenyo Flow estuary? The planes can fly over the sea, and a bullet train can take passengers to the city centre. Everyone wins - well except for the local wildlife, but what's @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@ to you or me?"

[b][anchor=380]#380[/anchor]: Farmers Seeding Discontent [Bulgar Rouge; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Farmers throughout the country are threatening a nationwide strike, because their domestic produce cannot compete with cheap foreign imports. They demand that the government step in and protect the agricultural sector.

The Debate
1. "Foreign competition is slowly destroying us!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while waving a pitchfork. "We invest so much effort and time to get a quality yield, and eventually we end up throwing everything away because those cheap, plastic Maxtopian tomatoes are sold for half the price! I swear they taste like compost wrapped in iceburg lettuce, and yet @@DENOYNMPLURAL@@ still buy the damned things! We, the farmers of @@NAME@@, demand agricultural subsidies so we can lower our prices and compete fairly with imports. After all, our food security depends upon domestic production."

2. Economic analyst @@RANDOM_NAME@@ has other ideas. "There's an easier way to support farmers without spending millions on farms that never went beyond ox plowing. Just raise tariffs. Agriculture will be protected from a transnational race to the bottom, and @@DENOYNMPLURAL@@ get a little tax cut to boot. The tariffs will be unpopular abroad, but this conundrum only exists becaue of Maxtopia's long history of protectionism."

*3. "Are these people serious?" scoffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of A Whole Shipload, LLC. "Subsidies, tariffs, what is all that about? You're messing with the free market here! If foreign produce is cheaper, then that means they're better at doing their jobs. These ungrateful peasants just want government coddling, because they can't pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.

The Issue
The media is up in arms over the case of Eddie Jupiter, a minor who is being tried as an adult on suspicion of murder; the case has sparked a national debate over @NAME@@ and youth crime.

The Debate
1. "He's just a poor boy from a poor family!" pleads @@RANDOM_NAME@@, youth welfare activist and rock fan appearing on @@NAME@@'s most popular morning show. "Spare him his life from this monstrosity! The government must not try teens as adults. In fact, you really can't try them at all; they clearly don't understand the magnitude of their actions. Maybe if our government gave schools more funding, the teachers could explain this 'don't murder' concept a little better."

2. "Don't understand?!" thunders prosecuting attorney @@RANDOM_NAME@@ during one of many press conferences. "Tell that to the victim! The punk put a gun against his head and pulled the trigger. Now he's dead! The youth of @@NAME@@ need to learn to respect the rules of decent society, and the best way to do that is to impose harsher penalties. Solitary confinement, public punishment, curfews - the whole works. As for this kid, lock him up!"

[b][anchor=382]#382[/anchor]: The Appropriate Amount of Appropriation [Rapturia Ziwa; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
Recently a well-known clothing retailer, "Totally Happenin' Apparel Trends" (T.H.A.T.), began marketing a new hoodie that features deeply sacred iconography of a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ ethnic group. Civil rights activists, tribal emissaries, entrepreneurs, and an assortment of young punks from the local skate park have formed an impressive mob outside your office, demanding you take action.

The Debate
1. "Oh come on, you can't be serious," scoffs CEO of T.H.A.T. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, bedecked in a war bonnet and calavera-patterned t-shirt. "It's not 'stealing,' it's assimilating. Next you're going to be telling me certain ethnic foods and languages are being appropriated, too! These people just don't realize that we're helping promote parts of their cultural heritage by mainstreaming it. Think about how many people didn't know about the Native @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Emblem until we featured it on our clothes. Frankly, they should be thanking us."

2. "This is racist stereotyping and an insult to our proud culture!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a representative of the United @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Nations. "@@NAME@@ has been responsible for centuries' worth of genocide, rape, and discrimination against our people, and now you have the audacity to take one of our most sacred icons and turn it into a fashion statement? This isn't cultural exchange; it's cultural theft. We owe you no obligation and shouldn't have to share something you willingly bastardize. Cultural symbols, like ours, should only be worn by people that can prove they descend from that ethnicity."

3. "Woah, now, let's not get hasty. This is just a misunderstanding," cautions anthropologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Clearly T.H.A.T. had no right to misrepresent that @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ symbol like they did. But making these heritages off-limits to all outsiders? That's a little extreme, too. Why not introduce educational programs that aim to teach people about their culture, so ignorant folk don't accidentally make that mistake. We'll need a little government funding to kick-start the programs, but surely cultural acceptance and equality are worth the @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@?"

4. "Yo, man, did'ja consider the possibility you're askin' the wrong questions?" says a local youth, shouldering his way to the front of the crowd. "My parents are, like, a bunch of ethnicities all blended together, so we never have to worry about someone cribbin' our style, or who we should or shouldn't identify with. Why not make all forms of cultural identification a thing of the past? That way we don't have to worry about appeasin' or insultin' any one social group. It's mostly our parents and grandparents doin' all the yakkin', anyway."

A much-publicised incident last week saw a pack of feral youngsters raised by @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ attack a rambler exploring @@NAME@@'s countryside. Shocked by the news stories, human rights campaigners have demanded immediate remedial action to rebuild @@NAME@@'s social structure.

The Debate
1. "We can't just sit here while innocent children are denied their birthright to be human!" pleads human rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We need to implement a truckload of changes. That means increasing welfare spending, implementing strict punishments for child abuse and neglect, and most importantly, we need to send a task force to rescue these poor victims! Incidentally, we'd need to increase taxes to get these things done, but for Violet's sake, think of the children!"

2. "These children won't be able to just walk back into society," snaps Commandant @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "They're already a world apart from normal people. However, we can take advantage of that. If you let us take these children under our wing, in just a few years, they'll be the pride of @@NAME@@'s military! It'll be much better than that plan to mount guns on our K-9 units."

3. "You can't take these kids away from their families!" says famous environmental activist, writer, and hermit @@RANDOM_NAME@@.

The international community rejoiced this year as the people of Marche Noire overthrew the country's oppressive monarchy... only to elect an aggressively anti-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ leader.

The Debate
1. "We have to do something drastic," schemes General @@RANDOM_NAME@@ whilst lining up a row of dominoes, "Marche Noire is angry that we trained the old regime's secret police, and now they're letting the peasants divvy up the plantations. That threatens our business interests, and it could even inspire revolutions in some of our allies. I say we covertly support Marche Noirian rebels to reinstate King Zog.

*2. "Now, let's not get carried away," counsels Foreign Minister @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ with her pet kitten in lap. "There's more than one way to skin a cat, you know. For instance, we could simply put an embargo or ten on Marche Noire until it elects a cooperative prime minister. Half the country drives Marche Noirian cars; a trade sanction would cripple them.

The ones that keep citizens from a life of crime. Order. Justice. Parents. I will represent that. I am the hero @@NAME@@ deserves."

[3]. "But not the one it needs!" exclaims the chief executive of BurgerCorp, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, striding into your office dressed as his latest product, "What @@NAME@@ needs right now is to plug the looming hole in its budget - and that's something we can do through corporate sponsorship! Just auction of the rights to field a mascot to the highest bidder, and the nation's pockets - and your own, my dear @@LEADER@@ - will start to feel decidedly less empty." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "Don't do it!" screams your personal advisor, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, somehow the most flamboyantly dressed yet, "Any decision we make now will be a political torpedo: all we've been given here is a choice between being seen as convulsive, compulsive or corrupt! What we really need to prize is choice: the choice of the people to elect their own mascot - and your choice to push any really difficult political decisions onto the voting public!"

[b][anchor=386]#386[/anchor]: Droning on and on [Czechostan; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ drone strike in the hinterlands of Tasmania has successfully killed an infamous terrorist, Mad Max, notorious for assassinating your predecessor. However, collateral damage butchered dozens of innocent bystanders, outraging the international community.

The Debate
1. "These pinkos just love to make the worst out of positive situations," moans Lieutenant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who oversaw the drone strike from the comforts of @@CAPITAL@@. "Sure, some civilians were injured, but we managed to kill that psychopathic criminal. Had he survived, who knows how many more innocents he would have killed? Drone strikes are not only far more efficient than land invasions, but they also save the lives of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ pilots. If anything, the military deserves a much bigger budget to research new innovations like semi-autonomous stealthbots."

2. "Does anyone care what we have to say?" asks the Tasmanian ambassador, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, rallying in front of assorted pacifists. "You have no business intervening in our lands; let Tasmania control what happens in her borders! Imagine how you would like it if we started drone striking your streets. It's time for @@NAME@@ to back off and let nations settle their own problems. If @@NAME@@ wants to help, reparations for the grieving families would be a lot more appreciated than more robot assassins patrolling the skies."

[b][anchor=387]#387[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Diamonds Are An Expat's Best Friend! [Reploid Productions; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
Media outlets have been buzzing about the thousands of children abducted from their remote villages across the exotic nation of Brasilistan, suspected to have been carried out on the order of their own government. Reports are coming in that the abducted children have been sent underground to mine for diamonds, Brasilistan's most precious resource, but military intelligence suggests that some young @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizens living there have fallen to the same fate.

The Debate
1. "The Brasilistani government have been pursuing aggressive and provoking policies for years, especially in their attempts to annex their neighbour Marche Noire. Now they're abducting and holding hostage not only their own children, but citizens of other countries!" booms General @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, slamming her fist on the conference table and urgently gesturing to a map on the wall. "We have sat idly by and now it's our people over there waking up in the middle of the night to bombs and soldiers destroying their homes! @@LEADER@@, we must marshal our forces and intervene with the only language the Brasilistani seem to understand - violence!"

2. "The good general is surely exaggerating the threat here." @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, one of your trusted advisers responds calmly while drinking his tea. "Brasilistan is our foremost diamond trade partner, so we must approach the situation with diplomacy and targeted efforts. A knee-jerk military response is the worst thing we could possibly do here. I am confident that with some juicy incentives, the Brasilistani government will discover their error and immediately release our citizens."

[b][anchor=388]#388[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Napalm in the Morning [Reploid Productions; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
A troubled country called Brasilistan has abducted @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ tourists and sent them to work in diamond mines in appalling conditions. You gathered your advisers and decided the best course of action was war; immediate and violent.

The Issue
This is a grim day in the history of @@NAME@@. Today, @@NAME@@ goes to war. All eyes are on officials in @@CAPITAL@@, waiting with bated breath to learn what form the coming conflict with Brasilistan will take.

The Debate
1. "We must mount a full-scale invasion," declares General @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while jabbing at a map of Brasilistan. "We can land forces here, here, and here; and from there we can march straight on to their capital! It could cost millions of our soldiers' lives and take years, but short of nuking Brasilistan, this is the only road to victory."

2. "With all due respect, General, you are completely out of your mind!" @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Air Force huffs. "A full on attack will decimate our troop levels! This is a land whose terrain and climate our foot soldiers are unaccustomed to. No, the best approach is clearly the tactical one. We have gathered a list of targets that can be taken out through a sustained aerial campaign. This will reduce Brasilistan's ability to wage war long before we land a single troop carrier in their territory. Why send scores of our soldiers to their deaths when we can send scores of our bombs instead?"

[b][anchor=389]#389[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Sanctions, Sanctions Everywhere! [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
A distant country called Brasilistan has abducted @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizens and sent them to work in diamond mines in appalling conditions. You gathered your advisers and decided the best course of action was to wade in carefully with some carrot-and-stick diplomacy.

The Issue
The decision to try for a diplomatic solution with Brasilistan, rather than open warfare, has been a success with the hostages released. However, aggrieved leading members of the Brasilistani government are openly encouraging vigilantes in the nation's armed forces to hit back at @@NAME@@ and its interests. The debate now turns to what @@NAME@@ should do next to completely neutralise Brasilistan.

The Debate
1. "Extending the hand of peace was all well and good, but now we have to make sure they stay under our thumb", your Minister for Foreign Affairs Hillary Smoochinger says candidly, taking a seat in your office. "Right now they can fall back on their military and continue to do unspeakable and violent acts - don't forget they abducted their own children! But if we make that option unviable, then I think we'll find them more than eager to sit down to peace talks. To cripple their military, we need to cripple their economy, and the most effective way to do this is through sanctions. We can embargo the non-essential items, and stick considerable tariffs on the stuff we do need. Eventually they'll have to accede to our demands."

2. "Crippling their military is a good idea, but we don't have the time for economics to work", the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, General Dwight Powell barks. "We need to get our Navy to blockade their ports, get our Air Force to bomb their airfields and key economic centres – we don't have to put a single soldier on Brasilistan soil and we'll still be able to force them into submission. With blockaded ports, burning airfields, and a decimated economy, their military will have no hope of controlling the home front, let alone invading another country. They'll be soon doing what we tell them. A little gunboat diplomacy is all we need."

3. "These options all sound quite expensive", chimes in Timothy Lagarde, the Treasury Minister. "Wouldn't it be cheaper to, perhaps, send in a few very well trained, and very deadly, operatives and have them deal with the top officials in the regime? We might find some to be very agreeable to our terms after a few intense ... 'workouts', we'll call them. If they refuse to be co-operative, well, I'm sure removing them from the situation entirely might convince their successors to see our way of thinking. It'll be cheaper for us with no long lasting effects on either nation. Everybody wins! Except for those assassinated, of course, but let's not concern ourselves with those little details."

[b][anchor=390]#390[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: An Unstable Situation [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Your government's response to overtures of aggression from the Brasilistanis has been to march the @@DENOMYMNOUN@@ army in and take out the tyrannical and violent government.

The Issue
The "intervention" into Brasilistan has largely been a success, but now the nation has devolved into anarchy with no functioning government. International allies and observers are concerned and have asked that @@NAME@@ clean up the mess it made.

The Debate
1. "This is our chance to expand our power and influence", your Minister for Defence suggests quietly. "Brasilistan might have had a tyrannical government, but the people may be useful, and it does have plenty of resources. We need to send in the remainder of our armed forces, quell any dissent, and set ourselves up a nice colony. We'd have more taxes coming in, a larger pool of people for our army to recruit from, and we'll have a nice power base in a far off part of the region. It'll be costly, but definitely worth it."

*2. Foreign Minister Hillary Smoochinger sighs before joining in the conversation. "If we colonise Brasilistan then we'll be doing exactly what its last government did that got us into this mess – sweeping attacks on another people's sovereignty. I agree that we should send in more troops to clean up things, but then we should help them set up a new, stable, and less aggressive government. Admittedly, this will consume large resources in the short term, but think of the public support we'd attain by establishing a new democracy full of freedoms abroad. And the long term benefits of ensuring it's a government that's friendly and sympathetic to our aims are pretty enticing too." [[color=blue]Must be democratic[/color]]

*3. Foreign Minister Smoochinger sighs before joining in the conversation. "If we colonise Brasilistan then we'll be doing exactly what its last government did that got us into this mess — sweeping attacks on another people's sovereignty. I agree that we should send in more troops to clean up things, but — and I know this may be controversial — how about we then help them set up a new, stable, and less aggressive government. Admittedly, this will consume large resources in the short term, but think of the international prestige we'd attain by establishing a new democracy full of freedoms abroad.

[b][anchor=391]#391[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: The Third Horseman of Brasilistan [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Your government's response to overtures of aggression from the Brasilistanis has been to sanction it beyond imagination.

The Issue
International allies have formed a coalition to impose economic sanctions on Brasilistan, but as a consequence, the nation can no longer import enough basic supplies to sustain its population. As it becomes increasingly impoverished, the embargoed civilian population is dying of hunger.

The Debate
1. "We can't stand by and let innocent men, women, and children die of malnourishment because of your government's shortsighted actions!" cries the CEO of the Global Meal Plan, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I know you're trying to make Brasilistan back off through economic means, but you need to please lay off some of the sanctions and embargoes and send some food aid through. You want to avoid the casualties of a war, but innocent people are still dying. I beg you, fix this."

2. "Brasilistan is weak, its people are dying, now's the time to deal the killer blow", your Minister for the Interior argues. "Of course we should send them food aid, but only if the Brasilistan government agrees to end their aggression, surrender to us, and submit their nation to our control. This little diplomatic incident will have ended, the Brasilistani will have food again, and our government can get back to spending money where it's necessary. Everybody wins."

[b][anchor=392]#392[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: A Pirate Problem [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Your government's response to overtures of aggression from the Brasilistanis has been to blockade its ports and bomb its economic hubs.

The Issue
@@NAME@@'s policy of forcing Brasilistan into submission via means of gunboat diplomacy has left the nation's government - and economy - in a shambles. However, rogue elements of Brasilistani society have taken to the high seas and are committing acts of piracy in order to make ends meet. With no functioning government to stop them, these pirates are being left to their own devices, putting @@NAME@@'s shipping routes at risk.

The Debate
1. "Obviously we have to get rid of these ruffians", your Trade Minister says bluntly. "They're putting our own economy at risk, as well as those of our allies. We've put a lot of time, energy, and resources into ensuring Brasilistan no longer remains a threat to us, and if we don't deal with these pirates soon, we might as well rename the place Penzance. Look, we already have naval ships in the area, why not just divert a few to take care of the problem. That way our economy is saved and we don't put the lives of any more soldiers at risk."

2. "That sounds a little drastic for what is basically a bunch of Brasilistani entrepreneurs", an advisor interjects dryly from the other side of the room. "We should be rewarding them for succeeding when their nation's economy is shot. Brasilistan needs a new, functional, stable government, and here are a bunch of people who have proven their ability to fight through the bad times. With our support, we could put these patriots in charge of their country and, obviously as thanks, we'll have a much more amiable Brasilistan to work with in the international sphere. They can get on dealing with their problems, and we can get on looking after our own people. Everything will be back as it should be."

[b][anchor=393]#393[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: A Naval Conundrum [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
@@NAME@@'s economic sanctions of Brasilistan have resulted in exploding levels of piracy. Your government has advised you on how to deal with this fledgling problem, and your response has been to send the navy after them.

The Issue
As the might of @@NAME@@'s armed forces heads for the seas off Brasilistan to deal with the pirates attacking shipping routes, the question of what to actually do with them has arisen.

The Debate
1. "The proper course of action would be to capture them and escort them back to Brasilistan to stand trial", your foreign adviser suggests. "There isn't much of a governmental structure there at the moment, I admit, but perhaps if we press upon what remains of the authorities the gravity of the situation, they'll act. If that means throwing them some resources to hold the trial, so be it. It's better we have nothing to do with the filthy pirates anyway."

[2]. "Why bother going through all that when we can do it better", boasts your Attorney General. "I agree that we should capture the hooligans, but then we should drag them back here to @@NAME@@ to stand trial. Who cares if they're not our citizens; they interfered in our shipping routes and posed a threat to our economy! That's sort of like terrorism, right? Economic terrorism! We've dealt with Brasilistan, now lets deal with these pirates and use them as an example of what we do to groups who try to harm our interests." [[color=purple]Must not ban Judiciaries[/color]]

3. "Capture them?! That'll take far too much time! I know of an easier way to sort this lot out once and for all", Admiral @@RANDOM_NAME@@ states with a sharp nod of his head. "We've sent planes and ships and whatnot out there already, let's just blow them out of the water while we're there. It'll save us having to drag them half way across the waters of @@REGION@@ for what'll essentially be a show trial anyway. Yeah, the human rights pansies will complain but who cares. This is economic terrorism and we must show no mercy to terrorists!"

[b][anchor=394]#394[/anchor]: Ten Days In A Mad House [Golgothastan; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
Investigative journalist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ has published a damning critique of @@NAME@@'s mental health facilities after spending ten days undercover as a psychiatric patient in @@CAPITAL@@ State Asylum. Her report details abuse, incompetence and negligence, and has led to angry clamors for reform of how the system is managed.

The Debate
1. "These hospitals are being run like prisons!" belts irate social worker @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ as he slams down a copy of the article on your desk. "Patients are treated like inmates; their rooms are like cells, and these antiquated 'treatments' redefine barbaric! Something must be done!" He pauses for a moment to regain his composure. "We need to completely revamp the state of mental health treatment in this country. Let's start by convening a meeting of all the world's leading psychiatrists - put up at our expense, of course - and then build a new specialist care facility in every town in @@NAME@@."

*2. "I'd like to spend more money on psychiatric care too, but there simply isn't any room in the budget," grumbles @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Health Service accountant @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "At this rate we're already going to be running a deficit next year anyway. We should be cutting down on expenses, not spending more. The taxes we save will mean citizens will have more in their pocket: they can pay for private treatment if they aren't happy with our basic services." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "I'd like to spend more money on psychiatric care too, but there simply isn't any room in the budget," grumbles @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Health Service accountant @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "At this rate we're already going to be running a deficit next year anyway. We should be cutting down on expenses, not spending more. The spending cuts will benefit the State, and when the State benefits, everybody benefits!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "I think we're missing an opportunity here," muses Minister of Internal Security @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This troublesome reporter hasn't actually been fully released from the Asylum yet. Why don't we just revoke her discharge paperwork and keep her there? We'll put the kibosh on her little 'exposé'. It's obviously the ravings of a mad woman. In fact, we could arrange a little 'mental health treatment' for all those meddling journalists! And don't you think the Leader of the Opposition might enjoy a checkup too?"

[b][anchor=395]#395[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Growing Pains [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
In order to secure @@NAME@@'s interest in Brasilistan, as well as stabilise the ravaged country, your government has ensured that someone agreeable to @@NAME@@ has been installed as leader.

The Issue
After @@NAME@@'s hand-picked candidate for leader of Brasilistan was assassinated in broad daylight – and then the next hand-picked successor mysteriously disappearing overnight – it's becoming clear that propping up a new government that is friendly to @@NAMES@@'s aims is much more difficult that originally imagined.

The Debate
1. "It's time we left Brasilistan, and that whole region, well alone", Hillary Smoochinger, your Foreign Minister says quietly, putting a hand on your shoulder. "It's clear that the natives are resisting our blatant interference, and our own popularity here at home may begin to suffer if we keep pouring @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ into another country. Let's just pull out and start spending that money where it belongs, here in @@NAME@@."

2. "I agree – to an extent", your Treasury Minister Timothy Legarde says, chiming in. "We definitely need to get out of the area as soon as possible, but that doesn't mean we should abandon all interests there. We need to pick a faction we like, show them how generous we can be in selling them some armaments and, ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom, we're not only seeing our interests served in the area, we're making cash while doing it. Extra bonus is we're not risking any of our people's lives. It can't go wrong!"

3. "What absolute bullsh-, eh pat. Absolute bullpat", General Dwight Powell, your Armed Forces Chief of Staff blurts out before correcting himself. "Yes, this puppetmaster routine clearly isn't working, but that doesn't mean we need to cut our losses and get out of the area! No, clearly we have something to gain from this and that something is Brasilistan itself. It's time to take the place over and sort the mess out ourselves in our own time-honoured way – absolute brute force."

[b][anchor=396]#396[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Is It Brie You're Looking For? [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
The World Assembly's International Food Welfare Organization has estimated that @@NAME@@'s harsh economic sanctions has led to the deaths of at least 50,000 starving Brasilitani. After pleas from civil rights societies and humanitarian organisations, your government has agreed to allow some aid into Brasilistan.

The Issue
Humanitarian NGOs are distraught after extensive news reports highlighting that food aid shipments meant for the poor, starving, and destitute in Brasilistan are not making it past the distribution centres. Reports are unsure whether or not corrupt officials are to blame, but the NGOs want you to do something about it.

The Debate
1. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a director of one of @@NAME@@'s largest charities, sighs. "It's not like this wasn't forseen. We all knew that the government elites in control of the Brasilistani distribution centres would look after themselves. This is what happens when you send unconditional aid unprotected like this. We have to continue the shipments, but from now on we need to send our peacekeepers to make sure the food gets to where it's needed."

2. "Or we could actually stop the shipments", your secretary says while collating some pages on your desk. "Look, there's always going to be corruption when we're sending them free food, so how about we spend the money on education programmes instead. You know, show the starving how to farm and hunt and make a living all for themselves. It's like that saying, give a man a fishing rod and he does, em, well he fishes with it, and he doesn't starve, that's the point. We can't forever prop them up with our food."

3. "I agree, stop the shipments", your advisor @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ says while playing with his hair absent-mindedly. "Stop the shipments and let the Brasilistani fend for themselves. If they starve, they starve – let's not forget who started this whole thing in the first place! If they want to act as savages, then let them live by the law of the savages; survival of the fittest should sort them out once and for all. And no more food aid means more resources for use at home. Win."

[b][anchor=397]#397[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Select Your Target! [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Your government's response to overtures of aggression from the Brasilistanis has been to bomb specific high-level, valuable assets in the nation.

The Issue
Having decided to launch a tactical strike on Brasilistan, your military advisors have drawn up a list of different targets, each ranging in terms of severity and civilian casualties.

The Debate
1. Admiral Nelson Wellington presents you with a file first. "This is an aerial view map of Western Brasilistan. We have circled in red key armament factories, military bases, and a military airport. Eliminating these targets will not only harm the enemy's ability to mobilise an effective retaliatory attack, but it also makes it easier for us to land troops on the west coast. The impact on civilians will be minimal."

2. "That won't be enough", Air Marshal @@RANDOM_NAME@@ says firmly. "Here is a map of the same region, but as you can see our targets are much more crucial to Brasilistan's infrastructure. Give the go ahead and my pilots will unleash their bombs on the city itself. There is a 100% chance of high civilian casualties, but it's to ensure that the enemy has a 0% chance of retaliation, in any way, shape, or form."

3. "Or we could just nuke them", General @@RANDOM_NAME@@ says, pushing the other two out of the way. "Think about it. None of our soldiers will go in so there'll be zero casualties on our side. All it takes is one bomb, so it's considerably cheaper, and it means there'll be no drawn-out conflict. I can't see a loss. To us, anyway. It'll decimate Brasilistan, but they are the enemy, and this is war."

[hr][/hr]
[b][anchor=398]#398[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Why Did You Do That?! [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Your government's response to Brasilistan holding some @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizens hostage was to bomb the living daylights out of cities with heavy population densities.

The Issue
@@NAME@@'s recent indiscriminate bombing of a population centre in western Brasilistan has not only attracted accusations of genocide from the international community, but also promises of sending military aid to Brasilistan to defend themselves from you!

The Debate
1. "We tried that idiot Air Marshal's way and now look where it got us", Admiral Nelson Wellington says with an exasperated sigh. "Now can you please take another look at this plan? It sees our navy launch missiles at a military airfield, key bases, and a couple of armament factories. It'll take place at night which limits civilian casualties to a minimum, and it achieves our aim of reducing Brasilistan's ability to retaliate."

2. "Call their bluff", a random general says, stepping out of the group of military advisers huddled before your desk. "Call those other nations out. Threaten to bomb them too if they even dream about getting involved. This is between us and Brasilistan and we'll be darned if any other pansy state tries to get involved. Keep up the current targeting of civilian centres – it's obviously hitting them where it hurts."

3. "Or... we could nuke them", your Minister for War says quietly. "Nuke them all. Brasilistan and any friends of theirs who join in. Wars are costly, and we already have more than a dozen bombs stockpiled. It won't cost us lives or money and it'll end this conflict quickly. It's time to show the world we mean business and we take war seriously."

[b][anchor=399]#399[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Invasion Plan [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Your government's response to Brasilistan holding @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizens hostage was to take out military installations and armament factories, weakening the country's military capacity.

The Issue
Despite having had a considerable amount of cruise missiles launched at their military bases and airfields, the Brasilistanis are showing no signs of giving up the fight. Public opinion has turned to ending the conflict, and there is a growing consensus that invasion is the only way to finish it.

The Debate

1. "We've softened them up, but that doesn't mean that an invasion will be easy for us", you military adviser says, unfurling a large map of Brasilistan and laying it out on your desk. "If we land here, here, and here, at these beaches on the west coast, we can march to the capital and wipe out any resistance we come across. We'll need to do it in overwhelming numbers if it's to be any way effective though – it's likely we'll lose a significant number of personnel."

2. "We'll be unnecessarily putting thousands of lives at risk if we do that", your Chief of Staff chimes in. "What we need to do is take out the boys at the top. Chop the head off the snake, as it were. If we cripple the chain of command by a decisive strike to the heart of Brasilistan, I think we'll find the invasion will go much more smoothly. We should be able to airlift our best commandos into the capital without too much difficulty. I trust them to complete the mission. Do you?"

3. "Invasion will cost our soldiers their lives, and we shouldn't put a single citizen's life at risk", your Minister for Domestic Affairs muses loudly. "Brasilistan is proving tougher than expected, their resistance is admirable, but it's time to put this whole thing to rest I think. I suggest we go nuclear. Couple of bombs in a couple of hours and this whole thing will be done by tea-time."

[b][anchor=400]#400[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Insurgents Resurgence [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
With Brasilistan's military weakened, you sent in some commandos to assassinate the leaders of the armed forces.

The Issue
Your elite commando units have managed to take out the command structure of the Brasilistan military, but its remnants are continuing to attack your troops present in the country. With public opinion beginning to turn, your advisers once again gather to discuss the situation.

The Debate
1. "We've gone this far, why not take it a step further", your Minister for Domestic Affairs says quietly. "Send in the rest of our armed forces to mop up, and then when they're done, encourage our own citizens to move there on a permanent basis. I'm talking colonisation here, yes, so it will be a long, drawn-out process, but we've invested so much already that it'd be folly not to follow through."

2. "Colonisation is expensive and right now it's unnecessary", General @@RANDOM_NAME@@ booms around the room. "But we shouldn't let them get away with hurting our boys over there. I don't know how y'all are feeling about this campaign but it's beginning to get on my back teeth and I'm getting sick and tired of these damned insurgents upsetting our every plan. We should just find them and kill them, and if we can't find them, kill anyone remotely connected to them. That'll teach 'em."

3. "Ah who cares about Brasilistan really", your National Security Advisor exclaims exasperatedly, throwing a pen across the desk. "I don't. It's causing us far much trouble, more than it's worth actually, and it's going to bankrupt us if we continue – and that's before we even think about colonisation. And even if we back out now, in a few years they'll retaliate once they've built up their strength. Let's nip this in the bud. Nuke them."

[b][anchor=401]#401[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: What's The WA Gonna Do, Anyway? [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Your government's response to Brasilistan holding @@DENOMYM@@ citizens hostage was to bomb the living daylights out of cities with heavy population densities. When questioned about this by other nations around the world, your decision was to call their bluff and continue in your bombing campaign.

The Issue
The relentess bombing of civilian centres in Brasilistan is causing mass casualties of innocents. International pressure is building as even allies of @@NAME@@ are now beginning to question the excessive force being levied upon non-combatants, insurgents, and enemy prisoners of war.

The Debate
1. "Ignore them, this is our war", Military Chief of Staff Dwight Powell snarls. "There are no innocent civilians in Brasilistan, they're all doing something to subvert our authority. We need to step up our game against these darned insurgents – show no mercy! No more taking prisoners of war either – kill them if they even so much as look at a weapon!"

2. "Now there's an idea..." @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of your protection service muses aloud. "And he's got a point too; they are all really insurgents, even if they're not taking arms against our boys. How about we stick it to the international community by rounding up some villagers and 'take care of them' right there on live television. And when other governments complain, which they will, we can doctor up some intelligence, say they were commanders of the insurgents, and that the live execution was a message - we're not playing anymore."

3. "Just nuke them", Captain @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your aide-de-camp, says in a passive tone. "We are a sovereign country, we make our own decisions. This is not their business, and this is not their war. If they criticise us, or try to use that World Assembly to do anything about it, nuke them. Just nuke any country that dares speak out. We have tons of nukes and we only need one per country, after all."

[b][anchor=402]#402[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: They Surrendered... Now What? [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
In order to fight back against Brasilistani insurgents, rebels, and guerrilla warfare, you laid down harsh justice and declared a regime of no tolerance, with instant death as a penalty.

The Issue
Military intelligence is reporting that a sizeable number of the insurgent forces have surrendered after a particularly brutal battle. Your advisors have gathered around you once more to discuss the developing situation.

The Debate
1. "This is great news", your Foreign Secretary Hillary Smoochinger says with a smile. "We can finally end this drawn-out conflict in Brasilistan once and for all if we accept their surrender. This is the vast majority of the native armed forces, but there'll still be pockets of armed resistance left and doubtlessly some horrid guerilla warfare. If we accept this surrender and treat the imprisoned survivors well enough, I think the remnants may be convinced to law down their arms."

2. "No. Absolutely not!" barks the operation commander from over your right shoulder. "Let's just deal with this and finish the job. Keeping these rogues alive would compromise the security of Brasilistan and the lives of our men on the ground. We should just kill them and set an example – do not mess with @@NAME@@. We'd best kill their families too so there's no retaliation. Just to be sure."

3. "I agree, finish the job", says your Science Minister. "And I have just the idea to do so – nuke them! I mean, look, we've wanted to test out our weapons for a while now, and the insurgents are all gathered in one place. Yes, we'll get some of our own men, and yes it'll destroy Brasilistan, and yes it will make people mad at us, but think of the greater good!"

[b][anchor=403]#403[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: We Done Killing Yet? [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Your counterinsurgency has been killing rebels on sight - along with their family, friends, and local postmen.

The Issue
With the vast majority of Brasilistani insurgents dead, there is no longer any threat to @@NAME@@'s soldiers in the nation. Questions now arise with what you should to with the war-torn state and its beleaguered and weary remaining citizens.

The Debate
1. "We should probably round up a whole boatload of our own citizens and ship them over to settle the place", your Minister for Labour @@RANDOM_NAME@@ says eagerly. "I suggest the unemployed. We could send them over, have them occupy the territory for us, and then lay the groundwork for a new, more stable nation. And if individual Brasilistani disagree? Well we'll give our settlers some weapons and let them sort out disagreements."

2. "Aha! Ha-ha-ha", your Chief Science Officer Professor Maxx von Strangehate cackles. "Occupy! What a silly goat you are! No, leader, what we should do is use Brasilistan as a nuclear testing site. Think of it! We'd get rid of all our problems in one easy go, and prove to the world at large how powerful we are! It's not as expensive as occupation and there'll be no gas bill at the end of it either. We already have the weapons, all we need is your say-so!"

The Issue
Upon arriving at your desk early this morning, you were stunned to find there weren't any dilemmas to resolve.

The Debate
1. "Well it's not surprising, it is?" pipes up @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from your entourage. "Every day, you expect the people of @@NAME@@ to come to you with their problems. Would it hurt you, for once, to go out and ask them what they want you to do?"

2. "They've given up!" grumbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, ever the pessimist, "and I don't blame them. All these decisions, made with the best of intentions, and they always go wrong. From tax code reform to that incident with Brasilistan, nothing ever goes quite the way it should. Just give up, and let someone else call the shots for once."

3. "Nonsense!" trills the annoyingly chirpy @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pirouetting around your office. "There's just nothing left to fix. Yes, @@LEADER@@, that's right. It's perfect. @@NAME@@, @@DEMONYM@@, you. All perfect."

[b][anchor=405]#405[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Time For A Colonyoscopy! [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
The problems in Brasilistan were mounting daily. So, when push came to shove, an advisor told you to just take it over. And you did.

The Issue
The dust has settled and, somehow, @@NAME@@ is now the proud owner of a new colony! There are still some teething issues, however, and there are some cultural and societal conflicts between settlers and native peoples. It's up to you on how best to resolve these issues.

The Debate
1. "Obviously we need to remove the settlers", @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Chairperson of the @@NAME@@ Council of Immigration Studies says frankly. "Pulling out completely and leaving the remaining populace to their own devices, however, would be detrimental and irresponsible. Ideally what needs to be done is to make Brasilistan a full part of @@NAME@@, and give the remaining Brasilistanis full citizenship. We'd all be part of the same country, with the same citizenship, and the same rights and responsibilities."

2. "Woah, hold on there, that's way too drastic, and way too fast", your Interior Minister chuckles. "That's not going to solve the issues they're facing today over there right now. We need to come up with some sort of initiative that slowly integrates the Brasilistanis into our culture. You should appoint panels of arbiters consisting of international experts to broker agreements between settlers and natives where necessary too. It'll work, definitely. Probably."

3. "It's our land now", your energy advisor says quietly. "It's ours. Our own. Our precious. Eh, where was I … oh yes, Brasilistan. Look, there's not that many Brasilistani left, let's just give them the useless pockets of land. Like those on mountain slopes or in bogland. All oil-rich and arable lands can be kept for ourselves. Sure, it's a little like segregation, but at least everyone will be happy, right?"

4. "All these options are valid, to be sure, but I have an easier way of settling this", @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the nation's nuclear program says in a matter-of-fact tone. "Can we please just nuke the place? Get our own guys out first, obviously but then just nuke it. We don't need a colony, but we do need a nuclear testing site. Our own citizens here are getting annoyed we're destroying good land in @@NAME@@ when there's a perfectly good dump in the form of Brasilistan."

The Story So Far
You have decided that the only sensible response to the crisis in Brasilistan is a nuclear one.

The Issue
@@NAME@@'s nuclear missiles stand ready. You know the risks. You've weighed the options. But the @@NAME_INITIALS@@SA requires your final approval before launching a nuclear strike on Brasilistan.

The Debate
1. "There is nothing left to discuss," says General @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, his voice echoing strangely loudly in the crowded war room. "The way forward is clear. Indeed, it is the only choice remaining. We are locked into this course of action. There's no actual decision to be made at all. So go ahead. Press the button. There's no stopping it now."

The Story So Far
You decided to deal with the crisis in Brasilistan by launching a wave of nuclear strikes.

The Issue
When you give the order to launch the nukes, your general briefly leaves the room. The moments tick by. When he returns, he simply nods once. "Birds in the air." There are almost two dozen people around this table, including some of the most brilliant minds and fearsome personalities in @@NAME@@, but none of them speak. "Three minutes until impact." You expected more activity. But there's nothing to do. There aren't even any gigantic computer screens, tracing the path of the missiles. It's beneath you, you suppose. Your job is not to track the flight of missiles. Your job is simply to decide. And that's what you've done. You've decided to annihilate another country. You look around the table at your advisors and soldiers. Some nod back at you reassuringly. Some won't meet your eyes. Not everyone will agree with you, of course. But it's not their decision. It's yours. The general leaves the room several more times. Finally, he returns. "It's done," your general says. "It's done."

The Debate
1. [No options for this issue.]

[b][anchor=408]#408[/anchor]: [color=goldenrod]Easter Egg[/color]: Pony Peril [Sedgelight Sparkle; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
A revolution in Maxtopia in which the state was take over by brightly coloured, anthropomorphic magical ponies, has made the government aware of the threat posed by ponyists in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "It's clear what we must do" bellows @@RANDOM_NAME@@, four star General in the @@NAME@@ Armed Forces. "These creatures, cute though they are, would seek to undermine our way of life, and threaten our very existence. This infestation cannot continue! We must round up all the ponies in @@NAME@@, execute them, and leave their carcasses to the crows."

2. "What a waste" interjects adhesives magnate @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, rubbing his hands with glee. "These ponies are one of the great resources of @@NAME@@. It's simple. Just slaughter them, dismember their corpses, and boil them down into glue. Our industry will be the envy of @@REGION@@."

3. "Don't you think they're both overreacting?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of @@DEMONYM@@ Salt Co. "These ponies are dangerous, but we must show some compassion when dealing with them. Instead of killing them, do the humane thing and force them into slavery. In fact, why not make it compulsory for @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to travel everywhere by pony?"

4. Psychiatrist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ implores you to see sense. "These poor creatures aren't actual ponies. They're misguided, delusional humans, wearing silly costumes. We must help them. A dose of electrotherapy should fix their warped minds, and any deviants who aren't cured can be lobotomised."

[b][anchor=409]#409[/anchor]: Water Palaver [Eremora; ed: Lenyo and Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The last remaining health advocates in @@NAME@@ have approached your office with a list of grievances about the "special additives" your government has placed in the water supply.

The Debate
1. An aging punk rocker with faded tattoos of X's on her hands argues, "The government adding chemicals to the water was a terrible idea. Forcing us all to drink these things against our will; that's a breach of bodily autonomy. People should be allowed, at least, to choose to opt-out of this harebrained program. Sure, providing PURE bottled drinking water to the citizens who want it would increase taxes, but think of all the jobs it would create! With clean hydration, our nation could accomplish so much more."

2. "Duuuuuude, we didn't go far enough," wheezes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, creeping into your office from an open window. "It was a great idea to put chems in the water, and it'd be an even greater idea to get some feel-good drugs into the cocktail. Everybody must get stoned, man; it's like that song. Now, it is a shame and an outrage, dear leader, that users of certain socially stigmatized drugs continue to be left out in the cold. It isn't fair that people who like to drink the tap water get it for free, while I have to spend my hard-earned @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ importing rare diamondback licking-toads. The government should add more highs to the supply, man! Subsidize recreational drug use!"

3. "So many voices. So many opinions. So many options..." intones your sinister intern, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shrouded in kretek smoke. "Some people need drugs to keep them calm and supporting our party. Others need drugs to feel good when they inevitably get stuck in miserable, pointless, dead-end jobs. Others, still, might benefit from drugs that help them go berserk on the battlefield. Naturally, government officials such as myself would benefit greatly from enforcing, shall we say, selective sobriety. Best of all, we could harness the power of addiction! People would have to listen to us - or else!"

4. "That sounds... downright frightening," shudders @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your medical advisor. "If I may be honest, I think we went too far when we laced the public water supply. I'm not saying we should ban anything, but we really shouldn't force anyone to ingest these substances. People shouldn't have to collect rainwater if they just want a refreshing drink."

The Issue
The trial of one of @@NAME@@'s most notorious embezzlers has ended after eight years with a "Not Guilty" verdict, despite most legal experts considering the evidence overwhelming. Some have suggested that trial by jury should be abolished for certain complex financial crimes.

The Debate
1. "Eight years wasted on that crook all because the jury couldn't keep up with the technical terms involved!" rants exasperated state prosecutor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, stuffing papers into a briefcase after the trial. "I'm not saying we should do away with trial by jury altogether, but for cases like these, which involve a great deal of expertise to even understand the laws in the first place - corruption, fraud, insider trading - there's simply no benefit in depending on a group of uninformed citizens to come up with a verdict." 

2. "Why are we so hung up on trial by jury anyway?" shrugs the author of the controversial bestseller Leviathan: The Matter, Form and Power of @@LEADER@@'s Mother-in-Law. "When you go to the doctor, do you depend on twelve random strangers for your diagnosis? Of course not. Democratic principles have their practical limits: we mustn't entrust the courts to dull-witted jurors who don't understand basic concepts such as reasonable doubt."

3. "Ooh, and what else do you expect me to do, luvvie?" clucks @@NAME@@'s most prolific juror, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ as she rolls up a copy of this week's Alright! magazine. "You know, I wouldn't mind deciding on parking disputes, especially if I get to chat with Rita from the Milton murder trial again. Did you hear she's had her hair done again - oh, where was I? Oh right, well this 'pyramid scheme' thing might've given me a headache, but at least it got me out the house."

A religious high school in @@CAPITAL@@ has caused quite a stir after firing a teacher because of his homosexual orientation.

The Debate
*1. "I can't see what they did wrong," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, proud parent and founder of the Holier Than Thou prayer group. "Homosexuality is an apostasy onto everything we stand for and believe in! I don't want my children to be exposed to it. Teachers are role models for their students for heaven's sake. I say all sodomites should be banned from teaching at all schools in @@NAME@@, lest the contagion spread." [[color=red]Must not have corporal punishment[/color]]

2. "Prohibiting people from doing their jobs just because of their love life is utterly ridiculous!" shouts a mad-as-hell civil rights activist, "Don't we live in modern society? Giving these fundamentalist idiots what they want is a huge violation of human rights. All people should be able to do their jobs, whatever their sexuality!"

3. "This is yet another example of what harm religion does to our society," says LGBTQ activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a rainbow flag. "Homosexuality shouldn't be a taboo subject anymore. Children ought to be brought up knowing that sexual diversity is just something that exists in society and is completely normal. To help society move forward, we need to get rid of religious schooling and teach that people should love whoever and whatever they want."

*4. "I can't see what they did wrong," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, proud parent and founder of the Holier Than Thou prayer group. "Homosexuality is an apostasy onto everything we stand for and believe in!

The Issue
An educational budget shortfall has prompted several local school districts to allow companies to advertise on school buses. This, of course, has aroused a major controversy over the ubiquity of advertisement.

The Debate
1. "I would like to let you know that I have a problem with this," states high-school social studies teacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "I teach my students all the time about the negative effects of advertising on the populace, and then at the end of the day, they leave on buses inundated with this very corporate propaganda! It must be outlawed! And since we're so strapped for cash, have the rich pay up for once."

2. "Corporate propaganda?" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Omni Consumer Products, "You've got to be kidding me! This is all harmless, you see. The advertising on buses is great for the school systems. How else would girls know that Maxxxi brand pads are right for them? Now, if you just sign here, businesses will be able to cover the buses with signs - to support education, of course - and perhaps we can advertise all over the schools themselves, too."

[b][anchor=413]#413[/anchor]: A Shot in the Arm [Nation of Quebec; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
The dreaded Rubellan Measles has made a sudden comeback in @@NAME@@. The disease, which once killed millions, was thought to be wiped out after a vaccine was discovered fifty years ago. Medical professionals blame a recent anti-vaccination movement, which has turned immunization into a political football.

The Debate
1. "I'm not going to allow my babies to become slaves to Big Pharma!" bemoans parent and prominent anti-vaxxer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Did you know that vaccines can cause autism and stunt a child's development? I can show you several studies that say so! These pharmaceutical companies are even putting nanobots in their vaccines! Nanobots! It is the right of every parent to determine what is best for their children."

2. "Please. Those so-called studies are nothing but hokum," counters your physician, Doctor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while checking your heartbeat with a stethoscope. "Vaccines save lives every single day. If it weren't for vaccines, Rubellan Measles would have killed off half of @@NAME@@'s population by now! There is absolutely no correlation between autism and vaccinations. Any scientist or doctor worth their degree will tell you that. If anything, we should make vaccinations mandatory for the health and well-being of @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ across the nation." The doctor snaps on a rubber glove. "Now, let's hurry this up. Cough, please."

[3]. "I agree, but we also need to send a message to these awful anti-vaxxer parents," states child psychologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Not only are these parents putting their children in danger by refusing to vaccinate them, they are putting all of society in danger. Do you really want to have an outbreak of Rubellan Measles in @@NAME@@s schools and daycares? I didn't think so. I recommend giving these parents a short jail sentence and banning their children from education until they're vaccinated. Sure, some people will complain about this being a violation of their rights as parents, but surely the health and safety of children trumps those concerns?" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

4. "You know, we wouldn't have these problems if the population was more scientifically aware," muses amateur scientist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while pouring a vial of green liquid into a vial of purple liquid. "Movements like these are bred from ignorance and misinformation. If the government took an active role in promoting science and education this problem would go away.

The Issue
A water main burst in a suburb of @@CAPITAL@@. After months of inaction, the pool of standing water has turned the now largely abandoned commercial district into a watering hole for local wildlife. Local businesses have come to you demanding change.

The Debate
1. "If the state of our town proves one thing, it's that the government is completely incapable of running it properly," argues cycling enthusiast and owner of the local bike shop Gone With The Schwinn, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Government priorities shift with each election cycle making it impossible for any real growth to happen. We need to privatize the local government if this town is going to run a profit again. Companies can bid for control of everything, from garbage collection to city hall!"

2. "You want to do what?" protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Mayor of the city. "A town is more than its profit margin, @@LEADER@@. Sure, we've seen better days, but it's because our budget has been hacked away year after year. If the government would invest in our fair town instead of throwing it to the wolves, we'd be back on track in no time."

3. "These plans, they have no charm, no wonder!" announces Elias Yensid strolling into the room with an elaborate model city. "I present to you the Exploratory Paradigm City of Tomorrow! What my team and I aim to do is transform this rundown one-horse town into the forefront of science, technology, and international togetherness. Maybe we'll even throw in a roller coaster or two. Think of it as a blueprint for the future! With me in full control of course."

4. "Every one of these plans conveniently forgets about the animals," chastises the head barista from Bean Me Up Coffee. "Y'all saunter in here after mother nature has made the best of a bad situation. That watering hole is crucial to the local wildlife, and it simply isn't fair to take that away from the bunnies and deer and the cute little birds. Let's take whatever money we were going to waste on rebuilding this failing town and turn it into a nature reserve."

2. "Banning these fortune tellers only treats the symptom, not the disease, " states your Minister of Education, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "If our people are dumb enough to believe this hokum, then we've got a serious education problem.

Your personal assistant, Charlotte Sweet, has threatened to tell the newspapers that you had an affair with her unless you give her lots of money.

1. "Even if you never went near her, we can't let this story get out," says your Chief of Staff. "Think of the scandal! No, no, no. Pay her. Pay the tabloids. Pay anyone who's ever heard the word affair! Pay them as much as it takes to make this disappear. Sure, this might be a quick and dirty solution, but sometimes you have to put your career first."

2. "We just have to make sure she doesn't win over the public with her deceptions," counsels your attorney, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Force all the newspapers to expose her as a liar. Release statements saying you stand by your family. Drastic measures must be taken to ensure media truth! Now let's prep your testimony. Repeat after me: I did not have an affair with that woman."

3. "Maybe this little problem really isn't a dilemma," opines your press advisor, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We live in modern times, and I don't think the public care about who sleeps with whom.

1. "What a tragedy!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@ at the grave of a victim of the accident, "It's clear that we must take drastic action to make sure this never happens again!" After blowing her nose, she continues, "We must put much more funding into the Coast Guard, light houses, communications equipment, our ports, round-the-clock submarine patrols... heck we should even have cameras on trained fish if it'll help.

We can't even blame it on those pesky opposition activists this time either! Obviously the Coast Guard needs to take full responsibility for this disaster, because clearly they can't get the job done under pressure. All they really do is harass tourists anyway.

3. "Blub-blub-blub," says diving enthusiast @@RANDOM_NAME@@ just before climbing out of the water, "Sorry, but have you seen the wreck down there? The Gargantic is so amazing! And all those skeletons really give the place that spooky, old-timey feel. We should totally advertise these sea-wrecks. Imagine the benefit to the economy. This could be: 'You've seen it in the headlines... now come see it for yourself!' The government could even post weekly updates on where the latest wrecks are."

The Issue
A group of very excited scientists has requested funding for a new space mission to land the Rapid Empyrean Delivery (RED) Rover on a passing comet.

The Debate
1. "It will be more than thirty-five years before we'll have another opportunity like this!" exclaims RED Project Leader, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, nearly bursting with excitement. "Remember, no other nation has attempted a comet landing, so @@NAME@@ has the opportunity to add all kinds of discoveries to the body of scientific knowledge. Admittedly there's no guarantee that the RED Rover will successfully land, but I'm sure we'll work out all the technical details."

2. "There's a reason that other nations aren't blowing government money on worthless scientific projects," rants your military advisor, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Wasting billions to put a remote control toy on a giant ball of ice in space isn't going to prove anything. What our nation needs is the respect - and by respect I mean fear - of other nations. Let's take out that meteor as a demonstration to the world of our martial prowess."

3. A frantic-looking citizen with a tinfoil hat bursts into the room bellowing, "NO! Our weapons are no match for Cxaxukluth, The Blackness from the Stars. Cxaxukluth uses comets to deliver his messages of creation! We must divert our entire telecommunications infrastructure to communicate with the comet in order to discover his all-powerful commandments!" The lunatic collapses, mumbling gibberish.

The Issue
A surprising number of politicians from all walks of life have admitted to smoking Maxtopian Grass and other soft drugs. Some are calling this a fragrant disregard of the law, while others believe this should spark a major shift in @@NAME@@'s War on Drugs.

The Debate
*1. "Isn't this typical?" scoffs columnist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "Once again these crooked politicians are getting away with things that would put us regular folk in jail. The government is sending a very mixed message by not acting on this. They decry drugs; yet several of their own are known users. If the government has any sense of credibility they would send these criminals to jail with the rest of the druggies." [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

*2. "Isn't this typical?" scoffs columnist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "Once again these crooked politicians are getting away with things that would see regular folk punished. The government is sending a very mixed message by not acting on this. They decry drugs, yet several of their own are known users. If the government has any sense of credibility they would send these criminals to rehab with the rest of the druggies." [[color=blue]Must not have prisons[/color]]

3. "On the contrary; this sends a very clear message," replies a man with a large beard while smoking an unidentifiable substance, "The latest polls show that the majority of @@NAME@@'s voters disagree with the government on this issue. More people than ever before are supporting legalization, particularly among youth. It seems like a few of our politicians have finally caught on. Instead of punishing these brave men and women for a victimless crime, let's do something positive and legalize the stuff already."

4. "I've got an idea!" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an advisor you thought you'd fired last month, "We can't alienate our conservative base by legalizing drugs, but we also don't want to send our political allies to jail. What if all the politicians wrapped up in this scandal set the record straight by saying they didn't inhale? That's what we experts call deniable plausibility."

[b][anchor=421]#421[/anchor]: No Child Left Behind Enemy Lines [Al-aqar; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A tear-stained petition crosses your desk, signed by a newly-formed coalition of parents whose school-age children have been killed in action. They demand you revisit the nation's policy on minors in the military.

The Debate
1. "It's barbaric that we have children in the military!" sobs bereaved father @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@. "Why do we put our little ones in harm's way? There must be a better way to keep this country safe. I'd gladly go to the front lines instead, if it meant my children's safety. Our kids should be in school, not the workplace and definitely not the army."

2. "We really need that child labor to keep the military running smoothly," concludes auditor @@RANDOM_NAME@@ after reviewing the budget for the thousandth time, "but they don't necessarily need to be frontline infantry. In order to console parents, we could restrict children under the age of majority to non-combat roles such as maintenance and cooking. That sounds like a fair compromise to me."

3. "It's not our vertically-challenged recruits that are the problem; it's the guns!" bellows Quartermaster Sergeant @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "They're too big for our pint-sized patriots. What we need are appropriately-sized weapons to outfit the army. It might not protect the grunts in combat, but at least they'll take a few more Bigtopians with them when they go. Shoot, we could even export the miniature weapons - turn ourselves a profit while we're at it!"

[b][anchor=422]#422[/anchor]: Wounded Veterans Demand A Helping Hand [Exemplaire; ed: Golgothastan][/b]

The Issue
@@NAME_INITIALS@@BS Nightly News has run an interview with a former @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Army officer who has resorted to using a hook as a replacement for the hand he lost in combat after the Department of Veterans Affairs failed to cover the cost of prosthetic surgery, prompting a deluge of complaints about the way @@NAME@@ takes care of its wounded veterans.

The Debate
1. "You can't ask young @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to go overseas to serve their country and then abandon them when they come home injured," insists recently returned double-amputee @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Wounded veterans like myself who have given their limbs for this nation deserve to live in handicap-accessible housing, and to have the cost of our surgeries and therapy fully covered, even if it does cost an arm and a leg. What's the point of spending so much on expensive new tanks and planes if you're not going to take care of those of us who have given so much already?"

[2]. "We couldn't agree more that these brave veterans deserve a better standard of living," hastily interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of military equipment supplier Global Strategic Solutions, Inc. "But there's no sense cutting procurement orders to pay for it. We would consider it our patriotic duty to foot the bill for free prosthetics for anyone injured in the line of duty ourselves. And all we'd ask in return is an agreement to plaster -- er, decorate -- the prostheses with advertisements for our civilian sales branch." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3. "That takes care of the symptoms, but not the cause," announces Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Director of the @@NAME_INITIALS@@AF's highly secretive Special Projects Division. "As long as we insist on using flesh and blood troops on the battlefield, these kind of injuries are going to continue to cause so much inefficiency -- oh, and human suffering too, I guess.

The Issue
In a bloody civil war in nearby Maxtopia, the majority Violetist community is rebelling against a minority-led secular government with a terrible history of human rights abuses. Some Violetists from @@NAME@@ have traveled to Maxtopia to fight on the side of their fellow believers, and are now returning home.

The Debate
1. "These Violetists are coming back brainwashed with fundamentalist ideals and trained in terrorist methods," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Internal Security. "They're a real danger to us all. You've got to detain all of these returnees for interrogation, until we can be sure that they're not planning terrorist atrocities here, however long that may take."

2. "This is all a massive overreaction," opines sociologist and civil rights campaigner @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The Violetists are no threat to us in @@NAME@@. All we need to do is provide humanitarian aid for the victims of the civil war, and some help for the returnees to reintegrate into society. I'm sure that none of them would want to cause trouble here."

[3]. "That's pointless," insists @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, one of the more bellicose members of the General Staff. "The real problem is clearly in Maxtopia. We should bomb the Maxtopian government until they agree to be nice to everyone." Then he pauses, looking confused. "Or maybe we should bomb the rebels until they agree to be less fanatical." He pulls a map of Maxtopia out of his back pocket and shows it to you. "Look: we've got plenty of great targets that we could hit. We could even bomb the Bigtopians to prevent them from entering the conflict. Let's just bomb all of 'em, eh?" [[color=purple]Must have a military[/color]]

[b][anchor=424]#424[/anchor]: You Just Sank My Battleship [DWAsnia; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Last month the @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ Navy's flagship scandalously sank while docked in the Lahabana Harbor. After analysis, experts concluded the primary cause was rust from poor maintenance.

The Debate
1. "Can't you see we need a hand in the navy?" complains Commodore @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while directing a diving crew, "How are we supposed to maintain our fleet if our routine maintenance budget is so paltry? Bigtopia has better warships, and you can't tell me they're a martial powerhouse. Grant me as much funding as I need so this doesn't ever happen again."

2. "This only proves that battleships are obsolete," concludes @@RANDOM_NAME@@ after watching the newest Star Trek movie, "@@NAME@@ needs weapons to combat the problems of the 23rd, I mean 21st century. We need to start research and development of an interstellar fleet or we'll be left behind in the arms race against... I dunno Klingons?"

3. "I know the real cause of this catastrophe," claims Crazy Boris, your least reliable spy, "Blackacre is obviously behind this attack. The signs of sabotage are everywhere." He takes a swig of vodka before continuing, "The engine explosion was most likely caused by my old nemesis, Ussa Maddox. Give me a free hand and I'll purge the spies that have infiltrated every level of @@NAME@@."

4. "You're all ignoring the bigger problem!" shouts a protester outside your office window, desperately trying to catch your attention, "That sunken battleship is polluting the environment horribly. All kinds of chemicals are seeping from the wreckage, and we're doing nothing to clean it up. Instead of building yet another war machine, how about we clean up some of our old messes, starting with this shipwreck."

[b][anchor=425]#425[/anchor]: Teach Your Farmers Well [Ouiatenon; ed: Raurosia][/b]

The Issue
After witnessing the horrors of both falling crop yields and furious farmers, your Secretary of Agriculture has proposed state-funded agricultural education.

The Debate
1. "Agriculture used to be the primary industry of @@NAME@@ and now look at us! Our lettuce is a let-down and our beets are barely pink!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Secretary of Agriculture. "But just send some funding to colleges, and show those city boys how to weed, water, and sow! It'll cost the taxpayer but I'm sure they'll sacrifice a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ for firmer tomatoes and browner potatoes!"

2. "Well, that's one option," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@ an acquaintance of your brother's mother-in-law. "But this is such a fundamental sector of our economy that we can't leave it up to the farmers to choose whether they go to college or not. The government ought to make getting a degree mandatory to enter agriculture. Doctors and lawyers already need them, and can you really call them more important than the farmers?"

3. "Mandatory degree?!" thunders @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ from atop his tractor. "Them college boys don't know nothing about farmin' that my old man didn't teach me! We've been tilling this land for seven generations, and by hickory we know how to do it best - we don't need any guv'ment folks tellin' us where to plant potatoes or what pest killers we can use! Now some of us farmers ain't the best, but same goes for those university-educated doctors and lawyers!" He trails off, still angrily waving an absurdly tiny carrot.

[4]. "You know, all this talk has got me thinking." notes socialist thinker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, brandishing a sickle. "@@NAME@@ has plenty of arable land, just perfect for cultivation. But we're going about it precisely the wrong way. You just can't trust private citizens with the people's own food. If we just nationalize the farms, production will surely rise!

[b][anchor=426]#426[/anchor]: Women In Uniform Under Fire [Vihenia; ed: Kandarin & Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
After a female @@DEMONYM@@ soldier was taken prisoner and brutally tortured in a recent skirmish, some citizens are calling for an end to female enlistment in the military.

The Debate
1. "This is a travesty!" argues Colonel @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@. "@@NAME@@'s women are our most precious jewels, and we've been letting them go out and die on horrible, bloody battlefields. We need to make the frontline combat exclusively for men, or our womenfolk will be in peril. Women should be content with support roles like nurses, secretaries, and cooks so we can free up fighting men for the meat grinder - I mean, the front."

2. "The nation needs more fighting men, all right," retorts Corporal @@RANDOM_NAME@@, phoning in from the front lines. "So much so that it doesn't really matter whether they're men. We should do away with all sexual discrimination in the military. So long as soldiers can meet physical requirements, shoot straight, and be ready to fight and die with a cry of '@@SLOGAN@@' on their lips, I say that's all that matters."

*3. "But that would send our womenfolk to fight in the wrong wars," protests infamously chauvinistic General @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, emerging briefly from a fortified bunker. "Women are needed on the home front, producing babies for @@NAME@@ so we don't get outnumbered by those fast-breeding savages we call our neighbors. It's not like weakling females can actually fight, anyways. And to ensure our conscription numbers are nice and high, it would be strategic to outlaw contraception and abortion." [[color=blue][Must not have vat-grown people][/color]]

4. "See? This sort of griping is why women are the only ones fit to be soldiers at all," says obscure feminist author @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "You don't see women falling all over themselves to be a hero and keep men out of harm's way. Women are more rational, keep cooler under fire, and are just as physically fit as men. I say we keep the men home and have an all-female military instead."

[b][anchor=427]#427[/anchor]: They Took Our Gubment! [Trippoli; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
@@CAPITAL@@ media has been abuzz with gossip that Harold Weissenegger, a former bodybuilder and action movie star turned politician who immigrated from Smalltopia at a young age, is set to run for Parliament in the upcoming election. With Weissenegger already ahead in early polls, the legality of an immigrant running for office has been brought into question.

The Debate
1. "You can't allow this," protests @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, currently a distant second in the polls. "I've put fifty years of my life into this country, all to see a Smalltopian barbarian muscle in on what should rightfully be my job? If we don't take action now," she continues grimly, "who'll stop him when he's after your job?"

2. "Why stop there?" queries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chairperson of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Nationalist Workers Party. "Immigrants are a danger to our society and cannot be trusted! Letting them in this country is one thing, letting them RUN it is an entirely different story. That's why we should ban immigrants like this 'Eradicator' from being police officers, judges, lawyers, or indeed any job that creates, interprets, or enforces the law!"

3. "I live here, work here, pay taxes here... well I live here," monologues Mr Weissenegger after smashing your door down for dramatic effect. "So there's no problemo with me running for office." As he tramples out of the splintered doorway, his last words are carried to you: "Or I'll be back."

The Issue
After several years of beaming Earth's location into outer space, it seems somebody has finally responded... by leaving cryptic messages in the form of crop circles in the fields around @@CAPITAL@@. You tried to summon the nation's leading minds to concoct a response, but only three eccentrics showed up.

The Debate
1. "Aliens! They're aliens I tell you!" raves @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Alternative History Channel's most notorious correspondent. "Finally we can establish a dialogue with the great extraterrestrials who helped mankind leap from the stone age to the ancient monuments of old. This is clearly a depiction of their alien moon. We should study it to learn more about them."

2. "That's no moon!" bellows @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the nation's foremost authority on Battlestar Galactica fanfiction. "It's obviously some alien form of surveillance, preparation for an invasion. I say we rally the combined military forces of @@REGION@@ and just shoot into the sky until we hit something! We're bound to kill at least one alien invader before we all die a hero's death!"

3. "Um, has anyone noticed that looks an awful lot like @@CAPITAL@@ FC's logo?" counters Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while spreading aerial photos of the phenomenon across your desk. "There's a logical explanation to all this that doesn't involve aliens. The circles were probably caused by intoxicated farm boys. Actually, investing in a small program to teach farmers how to operate machinery more responsibly couldn't hurt."

[b][anchor=429]#429[/anchor]: No Representation Without Taxation? [Bears Armed; ed: Golgothastan][/b]

The Issue
The recent publication of a book "Who Pays For Government?", written by internationally famous economist Millicent Freeman, has triggered a public debate about voting rights.

The Debate
1. "Look, it's simple," explains Finance Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Most things the government does cost money. That money has to be raised through taxes, so anybody who doesn't pay any tax shouldn't have any say in choosing the government either. We should make paying at least a specified minimum amount in tax necessary for inclusion in the electoral lists. It'll reward those who actually contribute to society, and give those who don't a bit of incentive to pull themselves up by their bootstraps."

2. "That's not going far enough!" insists teenager @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing a homemade Guy Fawkes mask while borrowing the controversial objectivist tract Maxlas Shrugged from the @@CAPITAL@@ Public Library. "Since state employees - like this parasite helping me check out my books! - are drawing their salary from the government, they're not contributing anything to the economy either, and they should be excluded from voting too!"

3. "No, no, a thousand times no!" notorious labour rights activist 'Red' @@RANDOM_NAME@@ protests. "Voting is the most basic right we have, and election day is the one time when every @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@, rich or poor, is an equal. The right to vote has to be protected for all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, and election day made a public holiday so that working class people can afford to vote without risking losing their jobs. The dip in productivity is more than justified by ensuring everyone has a chance to perform their civic duty."

4. "That's very stirring rhetoric, but I wonder if everyone really feels that way," muses libertarian scholar @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a research fellow at the Nyancato Institute. "So why not give everyone the choice? Make it legal for people to sell their votes, and leave it to them to decide what's more important to them: keeping their vote, or feeding their family."

The Issue
With the same old dilemmas confronting @@NAME@@ time and time again, people are demanding to know why there aren't more genuinely new issues.

The Debate

1. "Well, that's because they're all twaddle," says [violet] matter-of-factly while twirling a lighter in her hands. "I'm sick and tired of reading that garbage. I've decided to scrap the player-submitted system -- but don't tell anyone that. The endless waves of hate mail would overwhelm the server."

2. "The aim of this site is to promote my novel, not the writing talents of literary wannabes," scoffs Max Barry while sipping an iced-Margarita on a yacht in the South Pacific. "I've ordered the mods to only approve mediocre issues to ensure that no one discovers there are better writers out there than me."

3. "I've been combing through the queue, carefully examining each draft and determining its potential," sighs Sedgistan who is sitting next to an orderly stack of drafts stamped 'no way in hell'. "I'm confronted with thousands upon thousands of issues. I have to manage multiple editors and somehow still place in the Mod Olympics. Do you have any idea how much stress that puts on me? That's why it takes so long. Stop breathing down my neck. If you want to be useful, go help out the newbies in Got Issues."

4. "Huh? What's that?" says Sanctaria absentmindedly, looking up from an intimidating series of flow charts. "More issues? Well, it's your lucky day! I'm working on my next great chain. It will dwarf my last one in size and complexity. Forget everything you know about issues, every rule you think we can't break, because this chain is going to break them all."

5. "I couldn't agree with this more!" yelps Comrade Lenyo, his arms full of drafts. "We've received over 6,000 submissions! If we just got rid of the delete button, that'd be over 6,000 more issues. Who doesn't want that? Why are we still wasting time talking about this? Why are you reading this instead of submitting more drafts for us to add? EVERY. SECOND. COUNTS!"

6. The deafening Voice of Mod booms down from the heavens, "You will receive new issues when you receive new issues. Your questioning is undermining the authority of the mods. I've deleted enough nations to know flaming when I read it. You have been warned."

[b][anchor=431]#431[/anchor]: Gone A Stray [Junessa; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
A group of distraught high school girls has brought the problem of stray dogs and cats around @@NAME@@ to your attention.

The Debate
1. "There are too many strays just wandering around!" screams a concerned high school student as she feeds leftover scraps to a noticeably spooked mutt. "We need to gather all these poor animals and get them into a nice shelter where a loving family can adopt them and take care of them - whether they want them or not."

2. "No! No more animals, please!" begs animal shelter director @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ as she struggles to latch a cage full of cats. "Look, I love these fluffballs as much as the next guy, but we just can't handle any more. We're up to our ears in animals! The problem isn't with the strays, it's with irresponsible pet owners not spaying and neutering their pets. It's high time we required everyone to fix their pets. Do that and this problem will disappear."

3. "These animals deserve to be free!" screeches @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Everything. "They found a home in the back alleyways and dumps. Who are you to take them away from their homes, tame them and make them your slaves? They don't exist for your entertainment. We must free all of the animals!"

4. "Let's not get hasty here," interrupts Major Burns while polishing his oakleaves and war medals. "Now these animals could be of use to the police here and overseas with our brave soldiers. There are plenty of jobs that simply aren't suited to our patriotic boys in uniform. Yes, plenty of dangerous jobs. It's not like these strays are going to be missed. And at least we'd be giving them hot meals and a dignified purpose!"

A recent broadsheet special on the children of other leaders in @@REGION@@ has brought attention to the lack of children in your own residence. Mindful of your dipping approval, some of your advisors have begun to wonder if some popularity could be won back by having a kid or two.

The Debate
1. "This is a golden PR opportunity," exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, representing Moral Minority. "Imagine: you'd be the wise family figure. Think how much the people will love your new baby. You'll be the epitome of family values leading everyone into domestic bliss. And think of the merchandising! I mean, think of the children."

2. Maxford University demographer and suspected eugenicist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ disagrees. "The fact is our nation is overflowing with young ne'er do wells. They commit more crimes, are more prone to rudeness, and worst of all are least likely to care about your good works, @@LEADER@@. We have to send the message that we are going to do something about the troublesome demographics, and a good place to start is by you staying childless. And if we really want to crack down on population growth, we need to double down on border security too."

3. "Or how about adoption?" schemes @@RANDOM_NAME@@@, your PR expert." I could see you with a nice adopted Lilliputian boy and an adopted Maxtopian girl. It would look great in front of the cameras. You could be the most multicultural and tolerant leader in @@REGION@@! And if everyone follows your lead, the orphanages won't be nearly as dreary!"

[b][anchor=433]#433[/anchor]: The Worst Storm To Hit @@NAME@@ Since... Yesterday? [Eaischpnaeieacgkque Bhcieaghpodsttditf; ed: Golgothastan][/b]

The Issue
After the eighth terrible super-storm to ravage @@NAME@@ this week, residents of the affected areas, your own advisers, and random people seeking shelter from the elements have gathered in @@CAPITAL@@ to see whether anything can be done.

The Debate
1. "I'm tired of these storms, @@LEADER@@," sighs @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who looks as though he's just been dragged through a tornado. "The winds of this last storm were over 300 kph! My house was blown away! Something must be done to prevent buildings from being destroyed. Maybe if the government made it mandatory for all buildings to pass a disaster safety test, it would solve all our problems." He plucks a bird's nest from his hair before continuing. "I'd be prepared to pay a little more in tax if I still had a roof to sleep under!"

2. "Did you see how many times my supposedly lightning-proofed house was struck by lightning this morning?" cries violently twitching government advisor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, still smoking and smelling of ozone. "But when I was struck for the fifth time, I had something of a light bulb moment - literally. Why not create a way to turn the lightning strikes into energy for the city? Think about it for a moment: every time a bolt of lightning hits, we could harness the energy to charge the grid. Of course installing all those conductors is going to be horribly, horribly risky, but just think of the savings once they're in place!"

3. "Forget the wind and lightning, did you see the hail? It's the size of minivans!" screams @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, her voice echoing out from her hiding place beneath your desk. "My house was flattened like a pancake! What we need is some sort of weather machine that can limit the destructive effects of these storms. Sure, it'll cost trillions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in the first year alone and we'll have to divert funding from all other government departments to pay for it, but we could finally be safe."

[4]. "Never mind about the wind and the storms, they're merely a glimpse of our punishment to come!" exclaims Order of Violet cleric @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a prophetic text in your face. "The Book of Violet says that after me shall come the flood! We must retreat to the ark and prepare to cleanse our souls!" [[color=blue]Violetism is legal[/color]]

5. "You're all panicking, when you should be seeing this for the great opportunity that it is!" suggests the ever cryptic Minister of Creative Solutions, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We could make @@NAME@@ the tourist capital of the world relating to bad weather phenomena. All we need is to set up some dangerous storm spots as sightseeing destinations and we could be rich! Maybe the temperature will actually get below -40 degrees soon so we can unveil our 'Freezing Experience' tour."

[b][anchor=434]#434[/anchor]: Fraternity Furor [Nation of Quebec; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
After a drunken brawl between rival fraternities resulted in the deaths of five university students, concerned citizens across @@NAME@@ have questioned whether fraternities serve a purpose in modern society.

The Debate
1. "Dude! You can't ban fraternities," says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, member of Mu Alpha Xi, while crushing a beer can against his forehead. "Fraternities are like a brotherhood. They give us a sense of belonging. Sure, some of us may get a little out of hand, but we have a right to hang out with whoever we want. Don't we have like, uh, freedom of assembly or something like that in @@NAME@@?"

2. "Fraternities continue to be an embarrassment to @@NAME@@'s universities," muses your geeky nephew as he peeks his head over a quantum physics textbook. "Don't forget that the same guys who shoved me into lockers in high school are the same ones being caught uttering awful chants and participating in hooliganism. College isn't about getting drunk and partying. It's about studying, working hard, and preparing yourself for the real world. Shutter the frat houses, so us students can study in peace and quiet."

3. "Come now, old sport, you can't listen to this poppycock," scoffs grey-haired University of @@CAPITAL@@ alumnus @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, sporting a swordstick and a hat displaying the symbol of an alleged secret society. "Back in my day we didn't have these problems with our fraternities. The problem is because you allow any Tom, Dick, and Harry into our fine organizations without the proper credentials. Fraternities used to be only for the wealthy and shall we say, @@NAME@@'s [i]better[/i] citizens. Go back to the old ways and I'm sure these scandals will disappear."

[4]. "The problem isn't fraternities. It is alcohol!" invokes Reverend Joylove. "Some of these young men are a part of my flock and are otherwise upstanding citizens of society. I'm sure that they would never have become involved in a violent fistfight if it weren't for the alcohol polluting their bodies and souls. Instead of punishing the sinner, we must eradicate the sin.

[b][anchor=435]#435[/anchor]: A Working Class Hero Is Something To Be [Golgothastan; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
The quarterly production reports show that a worker from Northern @@NAME@@, Alenyo Stackemup, has mined more unobtainium ore than all the other workers in his district combined, leading to questions about how the state should recognize such spectacular industriousness.

The Debate
1. "Comrade Stackemup is truly setting a fine example to the workers of @@NAME@@!" enthuses the invariably optimistic Minister of Industry, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "Clearly we should be rewarding such commitment to the cause. If we increase his ration allowance and give him a nicer state apartment to live in, the other workers will be motivated to match his output. Of course we'll need a big promotion campaign to get everyone pumped up, but it'll pay off with a new age of economic productivity!"

2. "You're forgetting our revolutionary ideals," interjects the more idealistic Minister of Resources, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "From each according to his ability - to each according to his NEED. Comrade Stackemup doesn't need any more rations than any other miner, and building socialism is its own reward. Giving special treatment to workers who produce more will only lead us down the slippery slope back to capitalist exploitation."

3. "I actually think we have a bigger problem than that," says the perpetually suspicious Minister of Internal Affairs, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Have you really looked at the numbers his district has claimed? According to their report, Stackemup's production level was OVER 9000! That's just not possible: no one could humanly shift that much unobtainium. They're obviously falsifying the data. We need to eliminate such corruption with a thorough audit of the whole sector, and in the meantime, don't go making an example of Stackemup and his supposed achievements: we'll all end up embarrassing ourselves."

In response to a news story about a casino oddsmaker using offshore betting lines to perfectly predict @@NAME@@'s last set of election results, interested parties have wrangled their way into your office to bicker about what to do with this potential prediction tool.

The Debate
1. "Have you no decency whatsoever?" thunders @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Violetist demiarchwizard of @@CAPITAL@@, before anyone else can say a word. "Even if gambling WEREN'T a mortal sin, the democratic process will fail under such a mighty burden! You must outlaw gambling on elections. Card games are one thing, but this is gambling with the very future of @@NAME@@! Oh, and we should crack down on those sinful casinos while we're at it."

2. "Now, there's no reason to get excited," soothes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the @@NAME@@ Commissioner of Elections. "We can use this in a nice, boring, I mean safe, kind of way. Why don't we take bets on elections like bookmakers would take bets on @@DEMONYM@@ Pharoah in the @@CAPITAL@@ Derby? If the Election Commission runs all the action, we'll keep out the riff-raff AND put a little extra cash in our domestic budgets."

3. "Legalized gambling on ALL votes would be real sweet for our little thing-- uh, for the economy," confides @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, an unindicted co-conspirator in the trial of notorious mobster Maxine "The Octopus" Barryotti. "Folks should be allowed to make a little somethin' when their favorites win, am I right? More jobs, more civic participation! And just between you and me, we could really clean up." He nudges you with his elbow, glances around, and continues quietly, "Some candidates might just be headed for a fall, know what I mean?"

After a major server crash ceased all economic activity in @@CAPITAL@@ for 36 hours, furious powerbrokers have packed your office demanding immediate government action.

The Debate
1. "This is a travesty!" cries ex-multi-trillionaire @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose entire net worth was lost in the crash. "This would never have happened if I had all my money printed out and locked up in my safe behind my... never mind that. The point is that I have nothing to my name! I can't eat, my yacht was repossessed, and - dear Violet - I had to sleep next to filthy homeless people last night! The old system of bank notes and coinage was working just fine, and we need to go back to it NOW. We can't survive another major server crash like this."

2. "You can't be serious. Do you know how good digitalization has been for our surveillance programs?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Security Agency. "Terrorist attacks have dropped 75% since we've been able to monitor all commerce. Seventy-five percent! Do you have any idea how much of a feat that is? Obviously the @@DEMONYMINITIAL@@SA should monitor our electronic records to protect us from all internal threats, both terrorist and accidental. With us safeguarding currency records and watching all telephone and internet traffic, the nation will be safer than ever."

[3]. "More regulations? Bah! Hasn't the government already proven that it doesn't know what it's doing?" questions Microcosm CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Such a large project as currency digitalization is clearly a job for a multinational corporation, like say Microcosm. We can outsource the data storage to other countries where the labor costs are lower, and then your precious currency data will be far, far away from any domestic problem and much, much closer to SNAFU's in Marche Noire. No downsides!" [[color=blue]Must not have Autarky[/color]]

In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court of The @@TYPE@@ ruled that an obscure clause of the Constitution invalidates a government bill reaffirming the ban on same-sex marriage. Two groups have gathered in @@CAPITAL@@, one to protest the decision, the other to applaud it.

The Debate
1. "Could somebody please explain to me why a few unelected codgers in black robes are allowed to dictate public policy?" rants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the infuriated MP whose bill was overturned by the decision. "Judges are supposed to enforce the law, not legislate from the bench. This is a judicial putsch! A threat to @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ democracy! Tyranny! Parliament was elected by the people of @@NAME@@ and so the only checks to our power should come at the next election, when voters can decide for themselves whether they approve of our policies or not."

2. "Democracy is nothing more than a tyranny by majority without constitutional safeguards," cautions civil rights campaigner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose amicus curiae was referenced in the decision. "The very fact that the Court is unelected means that they won't be afraid to make bold decisions, while our politicians are busy pandering to the lowest common denominator.

The Issue
Several prominent critics of the government's ban on emigration have been captured at the border after almost managing to smuggle themselves out of the country by hiding in a manure truck. Their arrest has triggered a debate about the merits of such strict border controls on @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizens.

The Debate
1. "It almost feels as if we're prisoners in our own nation," protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while being hauled off to custody by several officers wearing pegs on their noses. "As much as we love @@NAME@@, not all of us want to live or work here, especially when there are better opportunities elsewhere. I was all lined up to take on an exciting new teaching job in Maxtopia, only for government goons to appear at my door to tell me I couldn't. How is that fair? The ban on emigration must be lifted!"

2. "Having a ban on emigration makes sure that our resources, I mean people, remain in @@NAME@@," reminds one of your most trusted, and sycophantic, advisers. "In fact, I'd recommend tougher enforcement of the ban. Oh! What about a massive wall surrounding our borders manned by armed guards? Huge guard towers! Tank and helicopter patrols! Freakin' @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ with freakin' lasers on their heads! We must spare no expense in keeping our iron grip - er, our loving hand - on every last @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@!"

3. "You're both missing the real solution!" interrupts your accountant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while combing through your tax returns. "@@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ want to leave? Let them, but tax the Violet out of them before they go. A good 90% exit tax allows us a healthy return on our investment while getting rid of the traitorous scum who want to leave. It's win-win!"

[4]. "Have you ever thought of why people want to emigrate?" asks human rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who somehow managed to sneak past security. "Look around you: oppression and pollution everywhere. There are no jobs available: is it any surprise people are looking for them overseas? If the government actually did something to fix these things, no one would want to leave. Improve civil rights, expand public works programs, promote economic recovery, and the emigration debate would disappear overnight." [Unknown; environmental beauty too high?]

After another movie season dominated by sequels, remakes and spin-offs, cinema buffs have come to your office begging for action.

The Debate
1. "What happened to the classics of days gone by?" rhetorically questions renowned film critic @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ movie industry used to be known for such masterpieces as 'The Modfather: Part One', 'A Clockwork Violet', and 'Once Upon A Time In The West Pacific', not the drivel they're putting out these days. If studios want to release films in @@NAME@@ they should give us something original."

2. "I didn't become a director to make films like 'Rise Of The Planet Of The @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ Revisited'," gripes @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "But it's all the studios will sanction. It's such an expensive business making movies, and given the risks it's no wonder we play it safe. Perhaps if the government were to underwrite our projects, I'd finally get a chance to finish 'Heaven's Door'."

3. "Haha!" chortles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while watching 'Mad Max vs. Jar Jar Binks 2: The Unrated Edition' on his smartphone. Shovelling another handful of popcorn into his mouth, he turns to interject, "Oh my god, this is the best part, guys. Will you keep quiet back there?"

The Issue
Honeybee populations have been deceasing at an alarming rate, according to a recent study published in Not That Popular Science magazine. Experts have swarmed your office demanding you take action or face catastrophic consequences.

The Debate
1. "This is a travesty!" exclaims concerned environmental scientist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Our food supplies will be at risk if the bee population declines any further. Colony Collapse Disorder is a serious thing and we don't really know what's killing them. It could be insecticides, parasitic mites, habitat loss, or maybe it's just all that hot air coming from @@CAPITAL@@. We must stop this before it's too late. Let's start with shutting down industries that manufacture insecticides and enforcing better environmental protection. We must stop at nothing to ensure our survival."

2. A local beekeeper, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, carefully steps into your office carrying a beehive. "What we need to do is to establish large scale bee farms across @@NAME@@, and raise more bees so their populations can grow." The absentminded beekeeper appears oblivious as several bees escape the hive. "Sustainable practices and good bee-raising will preserve the population. You give me and my fellow beekeepers some funding, and we can use that to grow the biggest colony you'll ever see!" Several of your aides exit screaming, pursued by bees.

*3. "Once again, science has the answer," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Bees and Genes. "If we use genetics to modify the bees, they can be made resistant to disease and live longer. This, my friends, is the breakthrough we need to stabilize the honeybee populations. It'll require a boatload of funding and we might accidentally create killer bees like the dreaded Maxtopian hornet, but we need to save nature's black and yellow friends while we have the chance."

[b][anchor=442]#442[/anchor]: You Can't Always Get What You Squat [Czechostan; ed: Golgothastan][/b]

The Issue
After a group of unemployed students were found living in a disused furniture factory in @@CAPITAL@@, landowners and law enforcement have become concerned with rising squatting levels in abandoned buildings.

The Debate
1. "It's time the government took action against squatting: it's disgusting and it has to be stopped!" complains business mogul @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "These degenerates are disrespecting the factory I built up through hard work, and they have no right to trespass on it as if it were their own! Never mind that half of my buildings are unoccupied and crumbling to the ground. We should be allowed to remove squatters using whatever force is necessary!"

2. "What's truly disgusting is how these corporate fat cats can be so unempathetic and cruel," remarks social democrat @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "They're hoarding abandoned old buildings waiting for the property market to improve so they can make a fortune selling them off to greedy developers for luxury apartment blocks - and all the while their fellow @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are sleeping rough without a roof over their heads! We should enact a compulsory purchase on all buildings that are unoccupied for longer than six months, and turn them into affordable housing for the homeless so they won't have to resort to squatting in some dirty old factory. I don't need to tell you where we can get the money from."

3. "Maybe you're looking for a solution in the wrong spot," says a voice coming from your office closet. You open the door to discover @@RANDOM_NAME@@, roasting a chunk of something indeterminate and meaty over a makeshift fire. "What's so bad about squatting? I mean, most of the buildings we live in are abandoned or unoccupied anyway. There will always be homeless people, and the government needs to acknowledge this and give us the right to live off the land, even if it's someone else's. Now close the door, you're letting in a draft."

The Issue
The price of most foodstuffs in @@NAME@@ spiked recently, resulting in bread riots. Terrified government advisers have put forward economic plans to stabilize the economy.

The Debate
1. "This cannot happen again," panics Minister of the Economy @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while wiring assets to an overseas bank. "We need to lower unemployment and control food prices if we want things to quiet down again. Major public works projects would ensure that the poor find good jobs and aren't just loafing around, stewing in their own juices. They could build bridges and beautify parks and organize public events. To be honest, what they work on doesn't matter; they could dig holes and fill them up again for all I care. The important thing is controlling poverty; food prices will eventually sort themselves out."

[2]. "The real problem is foreign control of our economy," concludes your Labor Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while absentmindedly combing his beard. "Multinationals that don't care about @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ oversupply trivial things like fast food instead of investing in our critical national infrastructure. Only indicative planning can begin to properly direct the economy towards essential production while maintaining the profit motive. With the commanding heights under government control, we don't have to worry about capital flight the next time recession looms." [[color=red]Must not have Autarky policy[/color]]

3. "What socialistic nonsense," retorts Finance Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, taking a break from scowling at jobless protesters. "That food price shock wasn't because of too little government meddling. The real cause was bad planning, a side-effect of half-baked subsidies. The market is smarter than a bunch of bureaucrats, so we should cut all subsidies propping up enterprises that don't turn a real profit. And if some people still can't find bread, then let them eat cake."

4. "Don't listen to that imperialist lackey," interrupts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a rioter throwing stale bread at you. "It's not enough to have national planning; we need WORLD economic planning. We should retool from making worthless fuzzy dice and sex-enhancement drugs and instead provide nutrition and medicines for needy peoples the world over. Perhaps you think the pig-dog capitalists will never let it happen, but I am hopeful. A rising dough lifts all nations, after all. It's time to end hunger once and for all."

The Issue
Last week a mothballed @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ nuclear missile exploded deep underground, triggering a catastrophic earthquake in rural @@NAME@@. The little evidence that could be recovered from the debris indicates that the explosion was caused by neglected maintenance of outdated warheads, spurring debate over the state of the nation's nuclear arsenal.

The Debate
1. "We clearly need a total overhaul," states Colonel @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Nuclear Deterrence Program, quite calmly despite the clamor outside of your office. "It will be costly, but once we have a new generation of warheads ready, we'll be perfectly safe from another incident like this happening, at least during my own tenure. We will, of course, need to dispose of the old missiles to make room for their replacements, but I'm sure the nuclear industry would jump at an ongoing contract to recycle the plutonium for us. It's certainly cheaper than mining more ore out of the ground."

[2]. "We definitely need to update our warheads," hastily concurs the Tasmanian Ambassador, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I propose we sell the old missiles to our friendlier neighbors. Then we get some money and ditch responsibility for the missiles, and we save an ally a lot of R&D. It's probably safe! Worst case scenario: the old missiles fall into the wrong hands while in transit to other countries, but if we just convoy them up with some regular munitions, the teamsters will be able to fight off any attempted hijacking." [[color=blue]Must not have autarky[/color]]

3. "Really?" objects Jacob Anderson of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Security Agency, startling you as he appears seemingly out of nowhere. "You actually think it was just a malfunction? Why do you think there was so little evidence left? That warhead was clearly detonated intentionally; I don't know if it was terrorists or spies from one of our rivals, but someone did this, and they did it for a reason. Our primary concern should be with securing our missile bases against sabotage. People may still be scared of nuclear malfunction, but hey - if nobody wants to live near our nukes, that only strengthens national security."

4. "You're all ignoring the real problem!" shouts a protester as she bursts through the door to your office. "The nukes were a bad idea from the get-go! Sooner or later we're going to annihilate ourselves with another accident. What's the point of even having a deterrent if we're just going to blow ourselves up? For the sake of humanity, the environment, and the national budget, it's time to disarm ALL nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons."

The Issue
After a recent newspaper exposé revealed that many corporations in @@NAME@@ have been using obscure segments of the tax code to avoid taxation, an army of proletarian protesters marched on the companies involved. Naturally, the corporations sent out their own troop of crack lawyers, and they have met in the only conceivable middle ground: your office.

The Debate
1. "Let's look at the legal facts here, shall we?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a sharp-suited lawyer opening a manilla folder filled with a seemingly unending sheaf of papers. "The organisation I represent acted within the strict letter of the law and structured its assets as anybody would - in a manner to avoid the maximum amount of tax paid. Taxes are designed to reward certain behaviours over others, by offering a scheme of incentives and disincentives to those behaviours: the mere idea that a change in which behaviours to reward, and that my organisation should finance that change retroactively, amounts to legislative tyranny."

2. "That's bloody ridiculous!" puffs red-faced protester, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, blowing spittle all over their supercilious counterpart. "They're trying to paint all of this as something that any reasonable person would do - but it just isn't! I don't know every inch of the tax code, and it's not like I can get all these smug big-shots to hang around the flat and tell me how to 'structure my assets', or some other rubbish. They knew what they did was against the spirit of the law, if nothing else - take them for all they've got. It's only fair."

3. "Erm, @@LEADER@@?" whimpers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a timid conflict-fearing Treasury Ministry employee, cowering in a fort made up of boxes of tax code amendments, "I think there's a way out of this. Surely we can just change the law to take out the biggest loopholes, without asking companies for any back payments for laws they didn't break at the time? It's not a perfect solution, but at least most of the protesters will go home and leave us alone - at least until they realize the corporate lawyers are back to their usual tricks?"

[b][anchor=446]#446[/anchor]: In The Land Of Milk And Money? [Kaztropol; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
A recent survey from the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Directorate for Health showed that a growing minority of the nation's women are having difficulties producing enough breast milk for their infants. Now a leading breastfeeding advocate has suggested a co-operative scheme in which nursing mothers share surplus milk with other mothers who are having difficulties, for a small profit.

The Debate
1. "It's simple really," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while scattering rose petals all over your office. "All kids should have a chance at the sweet nectar of a mother's breast, and we'll provide havens where mothers can share and receive in a relaxed environment. There'll be velvet cushions, scented candles and mood music. And to facilitate the money part I've designed a coin-operated nursing bra that the girls can wear. Would you like me to demonstrate?"

2. "This is a noble idea," says Doctor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, grey eminence of the national health bureaucracy. "Allowing this dissemination of milk will undoubtedly improve the health of our new baby citizens. However, clearly the government must handle this, as to secure proper hygiene and acceptable safety standards. Mothers can deposit their milk at approved facilities, and those lacking can apply for free rations through the appropriate channels. Let's not talk of monetary compensation: that is distasteful."

3. "And why should this only be eligible for mothers?" counters @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, noted libertarian who has embraced his Oedipus complex. "There is a wider market here, and we should acknowledge that. Who wouldn't want breast milk with their cereal, or in their coffee? I know I would! No meddling regulations and restrictions, let milk and money flow free!"

4. "Hang on a minute there," yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of the infant formula company Got Milk Inc. "I just heard from a peg-legged homeless person that breast milk is a gateway drug to cannibalism, so maybe we're better off without it? With some government funding, my company can provide enough tasty and nutritious formula for all of @@NAME@@'s infants!"

The recent national elections in @@NAME@@ saw declining support for the established parties and a big success for the unabashedly populist anarcho-communist party Death to the State. The extremist fringe party, despised by all other parties, gained a surprisingly high number of seats. The government is now in chaos as the more traditional parties scramble to block Death to the State from having any influence on the government.

The Debate
1. "This is a travesty!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, MP for the Progressive Traditionalists, who lost several seats in the election cycle. "These lunatics openly state that they will do anything in their power to incapacitate @@NAME@@'s political system. We should ban anyone with a criminal record from running for political office. That'll keep them out along with any other extremist and traitor with delusions of grandeur. I'm pretty sure I'm clean. Anyways, we'll manage, I'd wager." 

2. "Are you insane? There'll be no one left!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Member of Parliament for the Liberal Conservatives, speaking to their bitter rival for the first time in years. "Let's strike a bargain, @@LEADER@@, you and me, stating that the biggest political parties form the government. Your party still managed to come ahead, of course, but you need us to ensure your political survival. We'll be happy to support your government provided there's an equitable share of cabinet ministers, you compromise on the omnibus spending bill, and you keep some of your more radical party members in line." 

3. "What utter nonsense!" rebuffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former Member of Parliament who lost their seat to a suspected arsonist. "The only real solution is holding a new election whenever a stable government can't be formed. The people of @@NAME@@ are smart; I'm sure they'll realize what a mistake they made the first time around and restore the order of things. Doing the election over again will be costly, sure, but I really need this gig. I mean, the nation's ability to be governed is at stake! Yes, that's the one." 

4. "Or you just let us be a part of the government, or at least let be part of your group in Parliament", says the belligerent @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, leader of Death to the State, his body covered in gang tattoos. "The people voted for us, after all, and this blatant disregard for the popular vote is shocking. We'll want something in return for our support, of course, but we're not greedy. Just implement some of our campaign promises about cleansing the state apparatus of the bourgeois plague of bureaucracy, and you'll get your majority."

The Issue
A recently released book authored by @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your former Human Services Minister, has highlighted the financial and mental health concerns of parents in @@NAME@@. The book has thrust the issue of childcare back into the public spotlight.

The Debate
1. "I don't know how much more I can take without government support," complains a visibly stressed out mother while desperately trying to console her screaming child. "Between working two jobs and raising a child, I don't know how I'm managing to hold it together. The government needs to start getting involved before there are mass mental breakdowns! If you gave parents a tax credit and invest in some mental health initiatives, it would really help. Oh, won't somebody please think of the children?"

2. "The problem is that these fathers and mothers obviously have no idea how to do their job," counters your Education Minister while raising her voice over the tantrum-throwing toddler. "Parents need to understand budgeting, stress management, and how to calm down screaming infants. I propose mandatory parenting classes for adults and teenagers alike. The government could then take away children from those who fail the testing. Sure, that would mean investing more in the education budget, but won't you please think of the children?"

3. "You are all missing the obvious solution," coos your incredibly mature sixteen-year-old niece as she calms down the crying infant. "What @@NAME@@ needs is a national babysitting and nanny program. Parents obviously need a break from the stresses of child-rearing, and people need to know that their lives aren't going to be interrupted by screaming kids. By enlisting the help of babysitters and nannies across the country, along with investments in daycare and childcare programs, this problem will be a thing of the past." Your niece hands you the baby. "Isn't he adorable?"

4. "No, no, and no!" exclaims your Finance Minister, who has recently been named @@NAME@@'s most eligible bachelor by Bonjour Magazine. "Why should my taxes have to pay for someone else's bratty kids? I'm already paying over and above for these social programs that are obviously not working. Let's get rid of whatever childcare programs we have and save ourselves a bundle of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. If you can't afford to have kids, then don't have them."

5. "They have it all wrong!" invokes impatient company boss @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who is infamous for his misogynistic rants. "The problem isn't just that these girls neglect their kids, but that they neglect their work as well. If an employer feels his female staff are tired-looking, they should be allowed to dismiss them from their jobs. It's for their benefit as well as ours, we just take the decision out of their hands, so they don't have to worry their pretty heads over it."

Weren't you guys paying attention when fracking operations caused all those earthquakes in Blackacre? Never mind that they're on a fault line! We must put an end to fracking and start investing into green energy sources like wind, solar, and tidal power. We'll never run out of those clean energy sources, but we will run out of clean air to breathe."

4. "There's always room for compromise," chimes in @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your top aides famous for diffusing tension in your office. "We obviously can't ignore the benefits of fracking, but we can't turn a blind eye to the impact it would have on the environment either. Why not allow fracking, but only in areas of @@NAME@@ where there are no major populated areas? I hear that the land in the Northern @@ANIMAL@@ Mountain Range is just ripe for hydraulic fracturing. There is a @@ANIMAL@@ preservation area nearby, but it's not like they're going to be protesting."

[b][anchor=450]#450[/anchor]: Colonial Testimonial [Sussetonia; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
After @@NAME@@ recently acquired its very own colony, tensions have been running high as to how the events leading up to this should be portrayed in the history books, both in @@CAPITAL@@ and in its newfound overseas territory.

The Debate
1. "Well, they're part of the @@TYPE@@ now, so it only makes sense that we share one account of history," says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ native vacationing in the newly annexed territory, while adjusting his khakis and brand new pith helmet. "And that account should obviously be the glorious tale of how @@NAME@@ heroically ended their age of barbarism and brought the shining beacon of civilization to its heathen populace. That is after all, more or less, what happened. Stating otherwise would be nothing short of provincial bigotry due to wounded pride."

2. "It's a matter of pride, yes, but foremost of historical accuracy," asserts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former guerrilla who somehow miraculously survived your massive counterinsurgency. "We must teach the children, both in @@NAME@@ and here, about what actually happened. History is supposed to be about the facts. It should educate, not propagate imperialist dogma and effectively teach our kids to be ashamed of their home and whitewash all your war crimes. Let the history books tell the horrible truth and brand all @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ oppressors as the monsters they truly are, especially you, @@LEADER@@!"

3. "Look, we're not going to agree on this any time soon, so why not make both sides happy?" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, cultural anthropologist and author of the academically acclaimed book 'Can We Please Just Respect Everyone And Everything All The Time?' "@@NAME@@ doesn't want to be remembered as the brutal oppressor, and our new, eh, friends, doesn't want their hardships swept under the rug. So, let each territory have their own version of history! What could possibly go wrong?"

[b][anchor=451]#451[/anchor]: A Prosthelytizer To Burn [Sierra Lyricalia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
News media is abuzz this week as prominent atheist and anti-religious author Gary Montague has threatened to burn a copy of @@FAITH@@'s most sacred text in order to desecrate it and offend its adherents worldwide. As usual, everyone and their mother are demanding that you do something about this.

The Debate
1. Montague brandishes a copy of the offending book in your face while hiding in your office from a torch-bearing mob. "This so-called 'religious text' endorses people who commit murder, slavery, incest, genocide, and environmental destruction as holy and devout men. It deserves burning! I don't care how popular or moral @@FAITH@@ is these days: this so-called holy text is a blueprint for barbarism. That kind of evil has no place in our so-called civilized society." Montague panics and flees through your window as the mob breaks down the door.

2. "By all that's holy, @@LEADER@@, we cannot let this happen!" exclaims devout and questionably sane prosecutor Mildred Beatty, bearing a torch and pitchfork. "@@NAME@@ will be the laughing stock of the world if this nutjob gets his way! Let me send over some agents - good men, pious men - and burn him instead! In fact, we should open a new division just for this type of good work. We'll burn some of Montague's books while we're at it - some of them are dangerous, you know. Fire is bright and fire is clean! Fire will cleanse @@NAME@@ of its sins!"

3. "This guy Montag - is that his name? Mont- eh, whatever. It's obvious that he's the problem," suggests Stoneman Black, proprietor of the @@CAPITAL@@ Legitimate Businessman's Club. "Allowing him to proceed would damage @@NAME@@'s reputation, but so would turning into a tyrannical mobocracy. My uh... my associates and I can take him out for a small fee. Heck, we'll even make it look like an accident. All you need to do is look the other way, and your little problem will be solved."

4. "All of these people are tyrannical scumbags!" bellows the usually quiet Bic Granger, director of the @@CAPITAL@@ National Library. "You're talking about a cavalier disregard for the whole world's entire knowledge and heritage, from cavepeople to philosophers to tabloid reporters. Books can be immortal if they're taken care of. In fact, the government should be protecting books from the burners and ensuring that people have a right to read whatever they please, regardless of how offensive that might be."

The Issue
Video coverage of a protest outside of an abortion clinic has gone viral after the footage indicated that pro-life campaigners prevented ingress of pregnant women, causing the patients visible distress. In response, the Womyn's Liberation League has pushed for a bill that it says would protect access to clinics.

The Debate
1. "Passing this bill would be an important step in protecting a woman's right to choose," testifies the Womyn's Liberation League's spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The fact of the matter is that these protesters are obstructing women as they try to exercise a basic human right. When someone wants to terminate a pregnancy, the law ought to be on her side. Making abortion legal was a good first step, but we need to go further to secure these women's safety. Anti-abortion activists ought to be required to stand in designated areas far away from the clinics they're protesting."

2. "What about the right to free speech?" pleads @@RANDOM_NAME@@, lawyer for the pro-life activists depicted in the footage. "These are public spaces, and my clients should have the freedom, as well as the ability, to get their views across. You may disagree with them, but it would be draconian for the government to prohibit their citizens from revealing to people the truth about any medical procedure they are getting."

3. "The truth is that these abortion mills are killing thousands of children every year," cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a local curate and youth worker. "The government must defend the rights of the unborn - they too are entitled to protection under the law - and ban this immoral practice immediately. Anything less is permitting murder."

4. "Oppressor!" screams militant antitheist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pointing at the last speaker. "A bunch of middle-aged, celibate men refusing to allow women to have control over their own bodies - all these barbarians are doing is peddling their outdated misogyny, and I'm tired of it. The only way we'll make any real social progress is to put a stop to their hatemongering entirely. I insist that the whole anti-abortion movement be outlawed with stiff penalties for religious anti-choice advocates."

The Issue
After a WhoTube video featuring MPs in an outright brawl went viral, foreign commentators now regularly mock the hijinks in the @@DENOMYADJ@@ Parliament. In order to save face, several MPs have tried to reign in the legislature's embarrassing behavior.

The Debate
1. "We need a Parliamentary Code of Conduct to make sure this appalling behavior doesn't happen again," states Opposition Leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@. Your entire cabinet mooned me while I was speaking yesterday for Violet's sake! You wouldn't get away with that kind of behavior in any other workplace, so why is Parliament exempt? We need to show the citizenry that this is a place of serious and mature discussion, not a schoolyard playground."

2. "That's a good start, but it doesn't go far enough!" exclaims avid @@NAME_INITIALS@@-SPAN watcher and schoolteacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I always sit down and watch Question Period with the kids to teach them how democracy in @@NAME@@ works. They were subjected to the brawl, the mooning, and all those fights involving the chicken costume. Any politician who acts in such a disgraceful way should be barred from running for political office ever again. If we don't take tougher stances against this disgraceful behavior, our kids will start thinking that this is an acceptable way for them to act."

3. "We have a right to express our political dissatisfaction, no matter how... unorthodox our methods are," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your more outspoken cabinet ministers while making an obscene gesture towards the other speakers. "Sure, sometimes things can get a little heated, but that's the nature of politics. If the loyal opposition can't handle a few choice words or an entire hour of jeering, then they shouldn't have run for office. Besides, what about freedom of speech? Aren't we still big on that?"

4. "Hold up! Outta my way!" shouts pro-wrestler Stone Fist as he barges his way into your office and places one of your aides in a chokehold. "What if instead of debates, politicians settled their scores with trial by combat? Build a thunderdome in Parliament. Two MPs enter; one MP leaves! Imagine the ratings and publicity! People could even bet @@CURRENCIES@@ on the results. At the very least, the public will be a lot more invested in the outcome of parliamentary debates." Your aide passes out as Stone Fist releases his grip.

The Issue
A significant number of residents in @@CAPITAL@@ and other cities across @@NAME@@ have been growing vegetables and keeping animals on their property. The increasing presence of farm animals and intricate homemade irrigation systems have begun wreaking havoc on the infrastructure. Yesterday the busiest intersection of @@CAPITAL@@ was held up for over four hours by a woman trying to herd a large group of sheep to pasture in @@ANIMAL@@ Park. A cross-town group of affluent and angry citizens now demands that you control the burgeoning homestead movement.

The Debate
1. "These smelly beatniks are ruining our neighbourhoods," claims Tom Leadbetter, avid city-dweller and leader of the 'Proprietors Organization for the Safekeeping of Homes'. "Chickens in the street, goat droppings on my doorstep, and weeds so high that who knows what's going on right next door. And they're using waste water for irrigation for Violet's sake! If they want to live like bumpkins, let them move to the country. In fact, you should make them go."

2. "I have a right to grow my own food," counters a young woman who goes by the name of 'Starlight'. "By allowing plants, animals and people to flourish side by side, working with nature instead of against it, we're restoring balance to our cities. And it's great social policy, you know, educating the kids, alleviating poverty and boosting health, sort of. Don't be a part of the problem @@LEADER@@ - enact a nationwide 'Right to Homesteading'! Do it now!"

3. "Surely we can compromise on this," suggests @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a hip urban developer, while combing his moustache atop a unicycle. "Urban farming is really hot right now, and you can't deny that green spots liven up the face of a city. Let's tear down some downtown derelicts, set up a few approved farms and sell lots to the eco-conscious middle class. It's perfect! We can brand our cities 'green' and substitute the inner-city riff-raff with the young and fashionable in one stroke. Everybody wins! Well, except for the urban poor, I guess, but they're such a dreary bunch anyways."

4. Just when you thought you were done for the day, @@RANDOM_NAME@@ climbs through your window. The infamous primitivist and raging bovinophobe has another solution to the issue at hand. "The problem isn't farming in cities, it's farming period! The domestication of animals and subjugation of the roaming savage is what led to our downfall. The first step towards finding our roots is outlawing agriculture, in all its forms! We'll live off the land: pick berries and stalk @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@. It'll be grand, trust me."

[b][anchor=455]#455[/anchor]: Police On Overkill Mode? [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
When the police recently used a main battle tank to stop a robbery in downtown @@CAPITAL@@, many questioned whether the police should be buying up army surplus.

The Debate
1. "I thought the police were there to make things better!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, gesturing towards the devastated shopfront. "One moment I was being held up by a guy in a mask. The next thing I know a 50 ton war machine is roaring through my shop! Instead of some derelict stealing the money in the till, the police pulverized the entire building! Surely that tank was overkill? They're cops, not commandos."

2. The offending tank drives up to your office with sirens blaring before stopping just before it hits the building. The tank's turret swivels towards your head before the hatch swings open and Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ pops out. "Howdy! So ... you heard about that robbery we crushed - literally - downtown with Bessie here? I just want to say that militarization is the best thing that ever happened to law enforcement. Never been easier to strike fear into the hearts of criminals! In fact, you should loosen the rules of procurement for police equipment. Then we could have some real toys! To deal with gangs, of course, not to run around like drunken idiots."

3. "Officer Friendly here appears to overestimate the logical potential for heavy weaponry in everyday law enforcement," complains Chief of Department @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while glaring at the tank outside your office. "Special weapons and tactics have their place in hostage negotiation and riot control, but they shouldn't be deployed routinely. We should have heavily armed paramilitary police units, but they should be elites reserved for exceptional circumstances."

4. The tank drives off, ruining the gardens around your office. "I can't believe you let amateurs use heavy armor," comments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a military attaché from Maxtopia. "Occupying unruly neighborhoods can reduce unrest, but only if the job is done by professionals. Let the army handle your police work, and you won't have untrained idiots demolishing every street sign in their path. Nothing maintains law and order quite like the barrel of a gun and a proper curfew."

The Issue
Earlier this week an entire chapter of the motorcycle gang Daughters of Disorder was involved in a nasty accident on one of @@NAME@@'s major highways, leaving several of them dead. After medical personnel later ascertained that the use of helmets could have saved their lives, your Minister of Health and Public Safety made a statement proposing a set of new security measures mandatory for all motorcycle riders. The initiative has sparked debate, and is facing strong opposition from motorcycle enthusiasts.

The Debate
*1. "This law would violate our religious right to wear our sacred top hats while riding motorcycles!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the Violetist Scooter Corps, as @@HE@@ points @@HIS@@ ceremonial blade at your chest. "We have worn the top hat in times of war on the battlefield! Our protection comes from Violet herself! Require the ungodly heathens to wear helmets! Those who are chosen by Violet to ride will ride in style or die trying!" [[color=blue]Violetism is legal[/color]]

*2. "This law would violate our religious right to wear our sacred top hats while riding motorcycles!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the Traqnuil Yellowist Scooter Corps, as @@HE@@ points @@HIS@@ ceremonial blade at your chest. "We have worn the top hat in times of war on the battlefield! Our protection comes from the Yellow One himself! Require the ungodly heathens to wear helmets! Those who are chosen by the Yellow One to ride will ride in style or die trying!" [[color=red]Violetism is illegal[/color]]

3. "The stove pipe is right, helmets are lame!" agrees Dean James, your slacker nephew. "How am I going to impress any babes if I have helmet hair?" he asks, running his hand through his hair while checking out your secretary over his sunglasses. "Do the right thing boss; helmets are for losers."

4. "Don't listen to him, dear," says your sister, while she drags her son towards the door by the ear. "You had the right idea: everyone riding a motorcycle should wear a helmet, and a padded full body protective suit, and a reflective vest, and neck warmers and..." she continues listing security gear as she leaves the room with your nephew in tow.

*5. "It's not enough!" screams one of your junior aides, a fragile and slightly confused soul who was particularly disturbed by the recent accident. "It's not just traffic! People slip in the shower every day, cans fall on their heads in supermarkets, disoriented birds; we're all exposed, at all times! If people are too stupid to realize that, we have to make them! There should be a helmet law for everyone! Wear a helmet or go to jail!" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

The Issue
After a slow news week, one of your aides brought to your attention the controversy surrounding Violetstone National Park. A Tourism tycoon, Edward Rump, recently revealed proposals to purchase the land and intends to carve the faces of former leaders into Mount Rushless, a site revered by many Native @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@.

The Debate
1. "The area is perfect for what I have in mind" exclaims Mr. Rump, showing you some incredibly detailed concept art. "These monolithic carvings of the heads of historical figures will symbolize our nation's strength and pride." He gestures towards the faces on the blueprints. "Our nation's statesmen will not be forgotten! In fact, we could even open this up as a tourist attraction! Never mind that Native @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ consider the land sacred. These majestic sculptures will stand the test of time. At the very least they'll finally knock off the @@NAME@@ Tire Fire to become the Eighth Wonder of @@REGION@@!

2. "Who cares about some long-dead old farts?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your more youthful aides. "If there's anybody's face we should be carving into that mountain, it should be yours! You've already done so much for @@NAME@@, and it's about time you were paid your proper respect. So many world leaders worry about being remembered after they're gone. I'm sure you still have many years left in you, but this monument will ensue that you will never be forgotten."

3. "@@LEADER@@, have you no respect for our sacred lands?" asks Runs With @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@, Chief of the Violetstone tribe. "My people have lived in these lands for countless generations and now you are going to desecrate them? Even worse, you plan to honor imperialist monsters who slaughtered our ancestors? The government should be apologizing for those atrocities, not celebrating the butchers behind them. @@LEADER@@, these are our lands, not yours. Our home is not a tourist attraction. You must respect that. Our people have suffered enough."

4. "The mountain should be totally left alone," agrees environmentalist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, as she hands peace offerings to everyone in the room. "Mount Rushless is an environmental wonder and has been beloved for generations exactly as it is. If anything, we should be passing tougher environmental laws to make sure that these lands can't be sold to the highest bidder. We ought to be designating more lands as national parks and hiring more park rangers to protect them. The government's top priority should be protecting the environment, not opening up another tourist trap!"

An unarmed 18-year-old Bigtopian boy, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, was recently shot by Officer Matthias Kenny as he was walking home, despite video footage showing him with his hands up. The police shooting has aggravated racial tensions in @@NAME@@, and now civil rights protests have quickly spread from the suburbs, potentially engulfing the entire nation. You have been flown in to maintain calm and hopefully resolve the crisis.

The Debate
1. "Hands up; don't shoot!" yells leading activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ through a deafening megaphone. "We demand Officer Kenny's conviction and an end to cops killing unarmed Bigtopians! I'm sick and tired of racist police who assume all Bigtopians look and act the same. Cops should have to live in the neighborhoods they patrol, and the local communities need direct control over their precincts. That way we can fire any officer itching to do in Bigtopians."

2. "All this talk about race is divisive," says Officer Kenny's attorney. "Try to put yourself in a policeman's shoes for a minute. Cops need to make quick decisions in hostile situations, and that means they have to use the professional instincts they learn while on patrol. The Bigtopian boy fitted the description of someone for whom there was an arrest warrant, and he was wielding a baguette - which on a dark night can easily be mistaken for a shotgun - in a threatening manner. This tragic mistake was an isolated incident, and Officer Kenny shouldn't be held responsible for a single error on the line of duty."

3. "The boy in question was a serial jaywalker, proving he was a hardened criminal," Chief of Police @@RANDOM_NAME@@ states candidly. "So we can assume that the most notorious jaywalker in all of @@NAME@@ was up to no good. And those annoying protesters are just delaying traffic. I'll get the fire department to disperse them pronto. TURN ON THE FIRE HOSES!"

The Issue
Your Chief Economic Adviser, Mr. Shylock Holmes, was found dead in your office with several stab wounds in his back early this morning. A baffled @@CAPITAL@@ P.D. has called in the assistance of world-renowned Lilliputian private investigator Mr. Marple to help untangle the mystery. After several hours of thorough investigation, the notoriously eccentric detective has called all the suspects to the parlour.

The Debate
1. "You can't possibly think it was me," states Colonel Custard, the victim's old business partner, while trying to hide a red stained shirtsleeve. "He and I were the best of friends. In fact, I was paying him under the table to give you terrible advice that would favour my company; why would I kill him? If anything, it was probably that harlot secretary of yours. I know for a fact they've been getting it on all over your desk when you leave the office. This is clearly the result of a sordid affair gone wrong; arrest that minx! And while we're at it, throw a tiny tax break in my direction. It's what he would've wanted."

2. "Lies, all lies!" your young secretary Miss O'Hara hisses aggressively at Col. Custard. "He was no friend of yours, or those polluting Tourism facilities you have set up everywhere. He was a tender soul, and our love made him a new man; yes, with such a big heart, no wonder the old man had so much blood in him! He was going to propose cutting every one of those subsidies propping up your business, and you knew it!" O'Hara turns back to face you with crocodile tears forming in her eyes. "@@LEADER@@, I demand you have that greedy phony arrested, and then convert his damned factories into a series of national parks! It's what my love would've wanted."

3. "Silence!" shouts Detective Marple, as he stops grooming his impeccable moustache in one of your antique mirrors and walks to the centre of the room. "Mon dieu, enough with the talking of the words and the pointing of the fingers. The Great Marple hears nothing but the jibber and the jabber. The old friend, the foxy secretary; such clichés! Are any of you cold-blooded enough to have done this deed? I say, non! When you add it all up, there is really only the one solution. Only one in this room deserves to be put in the little grey cell." The elderly detective then proceeds towards your desk, and retrieves a quite exquisite candlestick from one of your drawers. "It was you, @@LEADER@@! It was you who stabbed and stabbed with the stick that holds the candles until he was no more! All out of fear for your young and dashing advisor outshining you. Take the murderer away, Chief Inspector Snickers; I am disgusted by their presence."

4. "Oh my Violet, this is just like the ending of 'The Maxtopian Falcon'," opines amateur filmmaker Professor Prune, who inexplicably appears from your closet. "You are being framed, @@LEADER@@. It was the detective all along. He killed your adviser just so he could take the case and make headlines for putting you away for murder! You need to hold him responsible, and the rest of the @@CAPITAL@@ P.D. too, for that matter, for being too slow to realize his ploy!"

Without farms, the nation's "hunt 'n gather" approach to food supply has proven disastrous. @@NAME@@ has become painfully reliant on increasingly expensive food imports to sustain its famine-wracked population. Many are now desperately begging you to bring back farming.

The Debate
1. "Please, stop the madness!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a famished ex-farmer picking through what's left of the ridiculously overpriced Marche Noirian rice in the local market. "The prices are murder! Even with foraging the local parks for berries, I'm using my entire salary just to make sure my kids don't die of starvation. Everybody agrees that the ban on farming was a horrible, horrible idea. However, there just might be time to sow the fields and recover most of the harvest before the weather turns. Act immediately, and I'm sure we can bring @@NAME@@ back from the brink." 

2. "I'll concede that a return to the hunter-gatherer society sounded better on paper," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former survivalist-enthusiast who turned out to be a terrible hunter. "We have to bring back agriculture - I see that - but we can't just let people go around setting up farms wherever they like and dig their way through the countryside. Please consider all the good that has come from this: see those roaming @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ on the fields, smell that fresh country air! Let's set up a limited number of government farms at select places. Then we should be able to feed the populace without the expensive imports, more or less, while embracing the primitivism that makes @@NAME@@ so great." 

*3. "The food imports are not a problem," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a wealthy gourmand, while drinking the tears of a thousand infants from a gilded skull. "@@NAME@@'s old palate was so incredibly mundane, and these exotic imports are just bursting with flavor. I've always said there's a certain 'je ne sais quoi' to a Maxtopian carrot.

The Issue
After a close shave with a rabid @@ANIMAL@@, a small group of apparatchiks in grey suits have gathered round the hospital bed in which you are recuperating to discuss the delicate issue of the succession.

The Debate
1. "I'm sure we'll have the benefit of your wise guidance for many years to come, @@LEADER@@," says your Chief of Staff @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "but just in case the worst should happen, would you mind letting us know who should fill your mighty shoes? Not that such a gargantuan task would be easy, of course."

2. "In the event of your unfortunate demise," suggests your brother as he surreptitiously replaces your recuperative health drink with finest scotch, "@@NAME@@ will need someone to look up to. Let's face it, the country is full of wastrels who need a firm hand. That's why an absolute monarch, with final authority over every aspect of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ life, is the answer. After all, such a monarch can always choose the right trusted, older candidate of proven loyalty and ability to succeed them. I think I know just the man..."

3. "No, you mustn't!" cries your sister, yanking the scotch from your hand and handing you a grape. "If there is a monarchy, it must be regulated by limits placed by an elected government. That way, the people still get a say in how their country is run, and the person at the top doesn't get overstressed. Not only that, but think what an unscrupulous person might do given absolute power: bump off loathed relatives, persecute political enemies and even destroy the country." Noticing your brother grinning at her, she remembers she has something to do and sprints out of the room.

4. "You know what I think?" declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your chief of security. "All this talk of replacing you is treason, pure and simple! You must eliminate anyone who has even mentioned the succession at once, before they usurp you!"

5. "I think science might have the solution," claims your attendant physician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who couldn't help overhearing the previous conversations. "With adequate funding and the latest medical technologies, my colleagues and I may be able to dramatically increase your lifespan. It'll mean diverting funds from everyone else's healthcare, of course, but what value would their insignificant little lives have without you, O @@LEADER@@, to guide them?"

6. "Even death need not be the end!" shouts one of your more fervent acolytes before being taken away for a nice lie down in a darkened room. "Why not declare yourself leader in perpetuity? Then we'll never be without your divine guidance! Think about it. @@LEADER@@... forever!"

7. "Er, excuse me," says your nurse, who has been attending to your intravenous drip and so far remained unnoticed, "but shouldn't it be up to the people to decide who your successor is?"

[b][anchor=463]#463[/anchor]: Smart Cars Driving Regulators Up The Wall[/b]

The Issue
The development of self-driving cars has led to debate about what they should be programmed to do in the event of an emergency.

The Debate
1. "It's pretty simple, really," opines freshman college student @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ on her popular weekly podcast, 'Overthinking It.' "The car should be programmed to minimize injuries. For example, if it's tooling along a freeway and a schoolbus overturns ahead, the car should prioritize saving the greater number of lives, by slamming itself into the nearest wall."

2. "I must say, that could be a hard sell to the public, cars that may decide to murder their drivers," says @@NAME_INITIALS@@-Motors Head of Marketing @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I haven't done a focus group. But that's my feeling. Look, it's perfectly legal today for a human driver to mow down as many schoolchildren as necessary to save his or her own life. Likewise, self-driving cars must prioritize saving the driver's life above all else. Otherwise, why would anyone buy one?"

3. "This whole debate is ridiculous," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a software engineer who is fixing the fonts on your computer. "To be honest, these schoolbus scenarios sound like something dreamed up by a Philosophy 101 professor, not something that will actually happen in real life. It's not the place of software to weigh the value of human life! Just program them to follow the road rules at all times!"

4. "Oh my God, I HATE those!" says impatient motorist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "They've been testing them near where I work. They drive like my grandmother, and she's in a coma. The other day I was late to work because the so-called Smart Car ahead was waiting for a squirrel to cross the road. A squirrel! I had to swing into oncoming traffic to get around it. And I had to hose the squirrel off my car afterward. Ban self-driving cars!"

[b][anchor=464]#464[/anchor]: The @@ANIMAL@@ Republic Shall Rise Again? [Omigodtheykilledkenny; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
A coalition of civil rights activists and minority interest groups from all across Northern @@NAME@@ have renewed their calls for the regional government to stop displaying the flag of the now-defunct @@ANIMAL@@ Republic, a short-lived former breakaway nation known for its backward racial policies. The issue has divided the area for years, and with tensions running extra high, you have been asked to help settle the dispute once and for all.

The Debate
1. "It's unconscionable that politicians still defend flying such a repulsive racist symbol on government property!" declares @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a civil rights activist sporting colorful Tasmanian tribal attire - despite recent public revelations that she in fact has no Tasmanian ancestry whatsoever. "That flag has only ever been used to heighten racial divisions in this country; we must ban the display of the @@ANIMAL@@ Republic flag in any official capacity!"

2. "Bah!" scoffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a local politician and passionate reenactor, while waving a miniature @@ANIMAL@@ Republic flag. "This flag never hurt anyone! If you ask me, it's political correctness that's the real problem. Stores are pulling the flag off their shelves, and TV stations are refusing to run old shows and movies that feature it, for Violet's sake! The government should be pushing back against all this nonsense and start teaching @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ schoolchildren all the good things about that chapter of our history: the cultural pride felt by its citizens, the bravery and patriotism of its leaders! Those are values that never go out of style."

3. "I agree that the flag is harmful and should not be used, in any capacity," predictably declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the advocacy group 'Peaceful Resistance against Injurious Speech and Slanderous Yabber'. "But why stop there? What about ugly racial and ethnic slurs? Words hurt people a lot more than some silly relic, you know. Words like, 'hoopster'...'ringnose'...'Biggie Snarls'...oh sorry, is repeating all these epithets making people uncomfortable? Er, anyway, we can't tolerate the use of such awful language, and we should start fining people for hate speech, like they already do in many progressive countries."

4. "If y'all were to ask me, I'd say we were better off during the @@ANIMAL@@ Republic", says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a local yokel of indeterminate age. "Back then us normal folks could go about using our own schools and buses without having to mix and mingle with those weird whatchamacallem's. @@LEADER@@, I'll be both frank and earnest, I don't give a hoot what flag y'all run up those poles of yours; just give me back my damned water fountain privileges!"

The Issue
To call the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Parliament unusual would be an understatement. The nation's randomly selected legislators are from all walks of life, but they lack the attention one would expect from career politicians.

The Debate
1. "This is insane," raves @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a popular TV personality, on her nightly political diatribe. "We have legislators who don't show up because they 'just aren't feeling it today.' Others are only interested in their pet causes, and they can't be bothered with essential bills like the annual budget. And the vast majority of our MPs have only a cursory knowledge of civics; they're baffled by fiscal and monetary policy. This incompetent government is going to grind our nation to the ground if we keep choosing representatives via lottery. @@NAME@@ needs actual voting and elections, so we can have a modicum of meritocracy. And just as a warning, I'll be running for Parliament myself."

2. "Our system of allotment works just fine as is," says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a senile MP while ironing his togas for the third time in a row. "Career politicians only run for office because they want to increase their own prestige and power at the expense of everyone else. Randomly selected citizens, on the other hand, actually represent the will of the people. The lots don't discriminate on beliefs or lifestyle or looks or experience when they choose representatives. Sortition is the embodiment of equality; hence we should expand the lottocracy to randomly select all government officials without exception. Now where did I put the ceremonial sorting hat for the next inauguration? I must have lost it at... uhm... where did I go today?"

3. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a history professor who also won a seat in Parliament, has another proposal. "We should preserve our tradition of sortition, but @@NAME@@ needs a balance between political principles and political reality. We need a formalized method to get rid of the incompetents by means of a vote of no confidence. If a majority of MPs want the habitually absent or the irredeemably stupid removed from the legislature, expressed via motion, then a vote of no confidence can be executed. Then when we have a dependable quorum, I can finally get my Acropolis Restoration Project bill passed."

The Issue
After a printing error on the official @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ map left off the tiny @@ANIMAL@@ Peninsula, its sole inhabitant, Mike Ronation, declared independence from @@NAME@@. Following his arrest of a mailman who failed to enter the "proper customs", a group of concerned citizens have asked you to address the threat posed by Mr. Ronation. His protest has already spawned several secessionist movements almost overnight.

The Debate
1. "Traitor!" roars @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a controversial nationalist politician, before screaming a tirade of obscenities. "This is absolutely ludicrous. We have to send a message to people like this Ronation scumbag! You do not secede from @@NAME@@. It's that simple. For the good of our glorious @@TYPE@@, we must invade and bomb Ronation's home. In fact, once this is all over, we should have our military patrol the streets of this great country to send a message to other terrorists who are thinking of doing the same thing. Sure, some people might call this an invasion of freedom of speech, but for the sake of national unity, we must clampdown on the other ingrates following in his footsteps."

2. "That won't be good for PR," chimes in your spokesperson, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while drafting your latest speech. "Considering how Mr. Ronation is no longer a part of @@NAME@@, he should no longer be entitled to our services. The more humane thing to do would be to ignore him, save for cutting off all essential services like water, electricity, and telecoms. We won't need to wait long before Mr. Ronation begs us to take him back. We can of course tax the Violet out of him when he returns. That will be much more effective - and cheaper - than sending in the troops. Then the groups he inspired will surely fall back in line!"

3. "Making him needlessly suffer seems a tad bit extreme," suggests Mike's concerned grandmother @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "Sure, I'm a little upset that Mike doesn't want to be part of our wonderful country and that he tried to snap that mailman's neck, but you have to look at it from both perspectives. If the government wants to win back Mike and the secessionists he instigated, they could start by allowing greater autonomy to regions that want it. I'm sure that Mikey will gladly return to us if you show a little love and understanding."

4. "The government can suck up to Mike as much as it wants, but it won't change a thing," rebuffs Jaques Strap, leader of a secessionist movement inspired by Mike Ronation's protest. "There is no excuse for the government to be treating Mike as a criminal when he has done nothing wrong. The government needs to leave him alone. In fact, the government should allow anyone to separate from @@NAME@@, so we can finally be free from the oppressive force of big government."

The Issue
The pride of @@NAME@@'s national swimming team, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, the fastest amateur swimmer in @@NAME@@, recently acknowledged that his parents had him circumcised when he was younger for "aerodynamic purposes". This has caused considerable debate throughout the @@TYPE@@, and people have taken to ambushing you while you're out for your evening meal.

The Debate
1. "This is sick and wrong!" vents trilby-clad protester @@RANDOM_NAME@@, flinging a copy of a news article strategically between you and your meal. "How can people think that mutilating diaper parts is okay? Religions and cults be damned. As you can read in this editorial, the paper's resident doctor proves beyond doubt that non-necessary circumcision has a host of negative effects. It doesn't matter that they're a doctor of journalism and not urology; it's basically the same thing. Bar emergency medical reasons, you must make circumcision illegal in all circumstances."

2. "Oy veh! Don't get between me, my kid, and our religion!" blusters restaurateur Ariel Goldberg, admonishing the trilby-clad protester and knocking over your glass of water in the process. "This kibitzer has nothing but disdain for our way of life - or the right to privacy! There are many opinion pieces and medical papers on circumcision telling of positive effects and, for me personally, my religion demands it! Look, you're a mensch, so I know you'll allow circumcision to continue; and, more importantly, allow parents to decide on circumcision if the bubalas are too young."

3. "Hey now, there is room for compromise," interjects @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a cosmetic surgeon at a nearby table, as she pockets a butter knife to add to her collection. "You see, we could ban all elective surgical procedures until a certain age, and then let the patients themselves make informed decisions on whether they want these procedures or not. It will take some extra funding to actually teach kids about different surgeries, to be sure, but that should have no negative effects on the population. I hope. Nonetheless, you can't put a price on informed decisions!"

4. "You people are all rather annoying," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your friend and dinner guest who has had to sit through the preceding debate while trying, at the same time, to eat currywurst. "@@LEADER@@, do me a favor and teach these disrespectful intruders a lesson in etiquette. Make all body modification illegal. Yes, illegal - under all circumstances, medical need or no. That will show these three a lesson for daring to interrupt our lovely evening. On the bright side, it should also disrupt that awful 'body-mod' scene that is simply ... distasteful."

The Issue
Blueriver, a private security company hired by @@NAME@@ during foreign interventions, made headlines when footage emerged of their mercenaries grotesquely torturing prisoners. Shocked and appalled, civil rights activists from around the world are calling on @@NAME@@ to do something.

The Debate
1. "Why did @@NAME@@ feel the need to hire mercenary groups like Blueriver in the first place?" rhetorically questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a jaded veteran of the Wezeltonian War. "The answer is clear: the army uses hired guns to cover up the body count of shady foreign interventions. Such dishonorable conduct sickens me. It's about time the military was open and honest about its actions. Only our brave soldiers should engage in conflicts, not amoral sell-swords who are notorious for looting."

2. "That's naive," frankly states the CEO of Blueriver, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who would only talk with you behind closed doors. "The reason the military hires my ... operatives in the first place is plausible deniability. @@NAME@@'s armed forces were clearly not involved in this breach of human rights. No harm done, eh? Release a short statement criticizing the atrocities, and then start a long, drawn-out 'investigation'. People will forget all this happened in no time. Then we can get back to doing what we do best. Just don't ask too many questions as to what that might be."

3. "Sir, if we didn't have quite so many of these pesky 'human rights' laws to follow in the first place, we wouldn't be in this mess," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an army lifer. "Don't even get me started on the Genièvre Convention. Terrorists spit upon all the values of civilized society, and yet some people want to prevent us from using all possible methods to stop these monsters. Give my boys the freedoms they need to get the job done, and we won't need to hire those contractor goons so often."

4. "Hah!" interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of Medicine not Machineguns, a humanitarian aid charity. "And just why is Blueriver finding so much work overseas? It might just be because half of our neighbors have been carpet-bombed into the stone age by us at some point or another. Maybe we should consider sending aid operatives instead? Building up a bit of goodwill would mean we wouldn't have to deploy shocktroopers all the time."

With the smoke clearing in war-torn Tasmania, the international community has begun discussing a peacekeeping effort. As your neighbors in @@REGION@@ have started logistical preparations, @@NAME@@ has now been called upon to contribute.

1. "The truth is we're not capable of contributing to a peacekeeping effort, as of today," states your top military advisor @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, while polishing his only medal. "That would require a substantial reorganization of our forces for international peacekeeping. Give me the time and the means to build up a modern army, and I'll have Tasmania off the map in no time! Uhm, I mean I'll keep the peace in no time, or... Whatever, just give me the money."

2. "I can think of a thousand reasons why rebuilding the army is a bad idea," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prudent young adviser from the Ministry of Finance. "But you really only need the one: the expense! And for what? Tasmania? In two years they'll just have another civil war. If you absolutely must polish our reputation, throw some aid money their way.

The Debate
1. Enthusiastically swinging a bucket and spade, @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Tourism Bureau implores you to strengthen the coastal defences. "We need groynes, sea walls, revetments, gabions - whatever you can get us! Without this protection, dozens more beautiful beaches and tourist hotspots will be lost to the sea, and then where will you go on holiday? Bigtopia?! Don't make me laugh."

Your advisers had gathered, some smelling like beer. They were shouting and arguing, filling the night with their cries; they were speaking of an emergency, that was happening high in @@NAME@@'s skies.

The Debate
1. "We have an unidentified flying object violating our air space!" pants your Aviation Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, turning a shade of purple, clearly out of breath from running all the way to your house. "It's not responding to our hails - you know, I don't think it even has a radio. We've issued numerous warnings to turn back too. This could be an armed drone, or some drunk yuppie, but I don't care what it is - the moment it crossed our borders, it became a security risk! I highly recommend that you allow us to shoot this terrorist down."

2. "Don'tcha know that you're talking 'bout Santa Clauseee!" slurs concerned parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, stinking to high heaven of sherry. "D'yareallywant t'shoot down Santa in front of the innocent eyes of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ childers? Do you really want to kill the Christmas shpirits? Let the flying thing come in.

3. "I think there's an easier way to ensure security but doesn't ruin the holidays," muses your partner, also awoken by the commotion outside. "Just like any visitor to @@NAME@@, make Santa go through all the necessary hoops. Visas, taxes for his imported goods, and those flying reindeer of his probably have rabies and should definitely be quarantined. Santa might not appreciate being strip searched, but hey, that's the price of security."

4. "Are we forgetting that Santa Claus is a wanted criminal in @@NAME@@?" asks overzealous police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, brandishing a picture of Santa's mug shot. "The guy has literally countless breaking and entering, looting, and animal cruelty charges against him. Let's also not forget the hundreds of elves he's enslaving all year round. For all we know his so-called "gifts" are nothing more than anthrax-laced candy. And I hear his reindeer shoot lasers from their eyes! We must stop this threat before it's too late. Then he can face the full wrath of @@NAME@@'s justice system!"

5. "Are we really taking this Saaanta thing this seriously?" yawns your teenage, social justice warrior daughter. "I hate to be the one to say this, but Santa isn't real. He was invented by the Seppsi soda company to deceive little children and boost their sales. If you really want to get into the spirit of the season, you should be less of a scrooge and spend more on social welfare, combating homelessness, and reducing the poverty levels. It's easy to do, especially if you order every working citizen to forfeit most of their month's salary in tax. Sure they won't be able to afford loads of toys, but Christmas is way too commercialised now anyway. The poor and homeless need money more than I need another Max Barry doll."

6. "Not real, you say?" questions a large, jolly man sporting a white beard, red hat, and thick boots who just slid down your chimney. "I can assure you that I'm the genuine article! Now all of this talk about shooting down my sleigh only proves what I've long suspected - @@NAME@@ has been very, very naughty.

[b][anchor=476]#476[/anchor]: A Farewell To Raised Arms? [Nation of Quebec; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
After several of your Party members accidentally voted with the Opposition during the traditional 'show of hands', inadvertently defeating one of your landmark bills, many have called for a reform on how politicians cast their votes on legislation.

The Debate
1. "With all due respect and all, why are we still sticking to this dinosaur way of voting?" comments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who at eighteen years old is the youngest politician ever elected in @@NAME@@. "Am I the only one who feels like we need some modernity up in here? And it'd be so easy too. Look, I put together this app on my way over that lets us vote on-the-go. We can vote while buying a cappuccino and then instantly post all our votes and political positions online. The public will know where we stand on hot button issues, while we're out in public! There's no way that this can be abused, I'm almost positive."

2. "It's not my fault! I was sleeping and a nightmare startled me awake!" cries supercentenarian Party member @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who at one hundred and ten years old is the oldest living politician in @@NAME@@. "The old ways are the best ways. We don't need this new-fangled technology which, may I remind you can often become quite, what's the word, eh, 'buggy', yes, that's it. If anything, we should celebrate our history by incorporating more of our traditional ways of voting; we could use 'kick the bucket' for the budget and 'throw the bone' for the Speaker!"

3. "Why must we always seek the extreme?" pipes up @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a representative from the 'Democratic Union of Licensed Legislators', coincidentally hovering around the mean age of Parliament. "What about a big green button on our desks for Yea, a big red button for Nay, and a big grey button for Abstain? That should be simple enough for anyone to understand, right?"

4. "There's an easier way to fix this problem," whispers your Minister for Democratic Reform, a position created for one of your most loyal Party members. "It won't matter in what fashion they vote if we force everyone in the Party to vote the same way as you! Anyone who doesn't comply or slips up gets kicked out of the Party – like the traitors they are – and stripped of all benefits. That should keep even the old geezers awake. I'm sure that the Opposition can implement the same rules for their parties."

[b][anchor=477]#477[/anchor]: Feeding Frenzy [Sleep; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The latest episode of celebrity chef Ramsey Oliver's massively popular television show "Lunch Box Revolution" has exposed the unhealthy junk food served in elementary and high schools, putting your government under pressure to act on childhood obesity.

The Debate
1. "We all know what the problem is, so why isn't the government doing a #$%! thing about it?" decries Oliver from your TV screen. "We need to stop feeding our children junk food, like those $%#&! chicken chizzlers. Maybe the government can't control what they have at home, but they can give them proper meals for school lunches. Force the schools to serve only nutritious meals and ban junk food from being sold in schools. It's a !%&$# no-brainer! The $#%!@ soda industry might not like it, but they can go suck a lemon."

2. "Who says you can't control what kids eat at home?" comments @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, one of your golf buddies, as he practices his swings. "You'd make it easier on parents if you mandated an official meal plan for children across @@NAME@@. I know I'd be much happier if a professional was preparing my kids' meals. Have you ever tasted my wife's cooking? Think about it. Hmm, that's probably a 7 iron shot from here."

3. "Healthy food and meal plans aren't the answer," objects soccer mom and former Olympic athlete @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, proudly displaying her gold medals. "The problem is that our glutinous hellspawn don't get off their lazy butts to exercise. We need more PE classes! Mandatory athletic training! More funding for after school activities! If we educate parents and children about good health and exercise, then they will get healthier and stay healthier. Not to mention they'll be the strongest and fastest in all of @@REGION@@!"

4. "Here we go with the food police again," sighs Burger Queen CEO @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ as he chows down on a double bacon cheeseburger. "How about you health nuts stop telling me what food I can put in my body? These kids are perfectly capable of making their own choices. If they would rather enjoy one of our delicious burgers instead of some gross salad then who are we to stop them? Sure, they'll probably have a heart attack or two by the time they're my age, but it's better to die fat and free than old and controlled!"

[b][anchor=478]#478[/anchor]: The Show Must Go On [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Fewer and fewer people attend the @@CAPITAL@@ Opera House, largely because the younger generation and the common man consider the shows archaic and boring. The once packed auditorium now struggles to fill seats, and it is nowhere near turning a profit. Without help, the @@CAPITAL@@ Opera House is likely to close its doors.

The Debate
1. "Empty spaces, what are we living for? Abandoned places, I guess we know the score," melodramatically declares singer-songwriter @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Hercules. "If @@NAME@@ loses opera, then we lose the very soul of our culture. Some things are bigger than money, and I'm not just talking about the leading tenor's waistline. I insist that we establish a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Arts Council to fund the opera and ensure that talented mezzos and baritones can survive, no matter the cost. The show must go on, go on..."

2. "No problem, I can Handel the funding for you," suggests TV-producer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while spreading out before you possible contracts for various TV programs. "Here are ideas for live elimination shows, dating shows, and celebrity-studded musicals to take place in that lovely building downtown. I've got a vision of big money, big drama, big entertainment, big merchandise, and big ratings: I call it Bopera. It's a big yes from me. Give my venture cultural-exemption tax status, and I'll keep the opera house's doors open."

3. "Waste of good land," succinctly concludes property developer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This is prime city centre real estate that could be upscale housing and a parking lot. I mean, what would you rather do: sit through six hours of fat people in ridiculous viking helmets singing in a language you don't understand, or cut time off your commute to work?"

[b][anchor=479]#479[/anchor]: @@LEADER@@, Put On The Yellow Light [Australian Republic; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
While heading to your office in @@CAPITAL@@, you suddenly find yourself caught in a massive rally staged by angry taxi drivers protesting Fubar, a popular ridesharing service. As the demonstration blocks off all nearby streets, you are forced to hear the drivers' respective demands.

The Debate
1. "Fubar is destroying our business!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while trying to offer you a ride. "They charge cheap fares only because they don't have to pay for registration, special number plates, and occupational insurance. That's unfair. Fubar is dangerously unregulated. They don't even perform background checks on their drivers! Do you really want these potentially dangerous drivers, who have no knowledge of the area, giving @@NAME@@ a bad name to tourists? Ridesharing is anti-competition and a threat to public safety. It must be banned!"

2. "I think all this nonsense is nothing more than these taxi drivers being afraid of a little competition," comments Fubar driver @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while checking their phone for nearby rides. "People are sick of taxis; they have to wave their hands up and down like lunatics in order to get one, or spend three hours on call waiting, and we all know taxi drivers always look for ways to cheat you. With Fubar, a friendly driver is always available fairly quickly and all you need is a phone app. I implore you to use some common sense. Fubar is safe, convenient, and the way of the future!"

[3]. "There's a better idea," suggests Matthias Ford, CEO of MechanikWagon, as he reads the newspaper in his self-driving car. "How about you replace all taxis with my self-driving cars? Think about it! No more racist taxi drivers, and it's been scientifically proven that my cars are safer than any human driver. As an added bonus, those pesky taxi unions will be destroyed, all with one signature! Passengers just go to a dedicated spot, press a button, wait for an auto-cab to arrive before jumping in and keying in their destination. Sure, the cabbies would become obsolete, but they can find new jobs. Right?" [[color=blue]Available only for nations with the technology for self-driving automobiles[/color]]

4. "You know, this wouldn't be a problem if we had more public transit in our cities," interjects bus driver @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ while delaying traffic behind her vehicle. "Fubar and the taxis are both great services, but only for well-off citizens. People who barely make ends meet don't have the luxury of affording a taxi to get around everywhere. It's time to start investing in @@NAME@@'s infrastructure and public transit, so that everyone can go about their daily lives. Besides, everyone loves our environmentally friendly buses. They're great for tourism and they're about the only vehicle that is accessible to the handicapped. Not to mention our drivers are much nicer than any taxi driver."

The Issue
A collection of fishermen's unions have besieged the capitol with rubbish, all of which was caught during fishing expeditions. The fishermen claim they catch more novelty singing bass than actual fish in their nets, because the nation routinely dumps its waste in international waters.

The Debate
1. "Clean up your act, @@LEADER@@; these heaps of Mad Max vs. Jar Jar Binks 2 DVDs are just the tip of the iceberg!" hollers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an impoverished fisherman. "If you think all this rubbish obstructing your office view is bad, you should see what it's like in the ocean. The fish are being killed off by makeshift continents of plastic and styrofoam and off-brand Jack Michaelson matryoshka dolls. @@NAME@@ needs to store its waste in landfills like other nations do, or we won't have a fishing industry to speak of!"

2. "I agree with the fishermen," quietly says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Environmental Minister, whom you've never noticed before. "But let's actually help Mother Earth this time round. Give my ministry a blank check for once, and then we can restructure our waste disposal towards recycling and cleaning up all that waste floating in the South @@ANIMAL@@ Sea."

3. "Are we going to let some foreigners tell us what to do?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an excessively patriotic citizen. "Our country is cleaner than ever! Never before has our glorious nation been so pristine! We should keep taking out our trash into the ocean, where it hurts no true @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@. And if people still complain about the international waste dumping, why don't we cast the whiners into the sea too?"

4. "There's a better way," claims a woman who will only identify herself as the Captain, while welding a blender to a rusty supermarket trolley. "I have an idea for a TV show. Give teams of contestants ten hours to build crazy contraptions with rubbish fished out of the sea, and the winning team gets a free boat! I call it the Scrapsea Challenge. Sure, it won't have a meaningful impact on the nautical pollution levels, but it will globally broadcast that @@NAME@@ is doing something for Mother Earth. Kind of. That publicity is worth a little government support, is it not?"

[b][anchor=481]#481[/anchor]: Social Equality Reaching Embarrassing Levels [Czechostan; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
Income gaps in @@NAME@@ have become so tiny that the paychecks of @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ CEOs barely surpass that of their secretaries. While some decry this as a sign of the end of days, others hail it as the beginning of something great.

The Debate
1. "You are effectively killing @@NAME@@," bemoans Ayn Bland, homespun philosopher and author of the long forgotten novel 'The Fountain Pen'. "Our most prominent minds are barely making more than average second-handers. There is no incentive to work your way up, and if we continue like this I guarantee that productivity will plummet and creativity and ingenuity will be a thing of the past. The government needs to stop forcing businesses to pay their workers such similar wages, cut taxes, and abolish any and all welfare. Only then will our prime movers flourish and the common plebeians put forth their best effort."

2. "What is this I hear about some citizens making more than others? Everybody is a winner and all must have prizes!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, obscure anthropologist and author of absurdist children's books. "Every last man and woman should be paid the same amount of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. This must be our #1 goal. My studies of the Dodo tribe in East Lebatuck clearly shows that complete equality of outcome promotes and nurtures stability, compassion and harmony within the community. The government needs to make sure that everybody is awarded their exact share of our common riches."

3. "Equality without direction or purpose is just useless moralism," bluntly states Karl Sparx, a first-year economy student. "For the time being, we should pay people based on their contribution to the social product. The same amount you give to society, the same amount you shall receive in return. It's the only rational way to promote productivity. Yes, my plan will entail less income equality in the short run, but a blissful paradise of abundance and workers' comradery in the Glorious People's Republic of @@NAME@@ once we progress from the lower phases! Oh, did I forget to mention that this is contingent on you nationalizing all industry in the name of the proletariat? Well, yeah, you need to do that."

4. "Good points, terrible solution," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your Bigtopian consultants, a strong proponent of the increasingly popular 'Third Wheel' approach to economic policy. "Some genuine income disparity could really help you promote growth, but you don't want come across all insensitive and harsh. Maybe a way out of this is a little rebranding? Roll back wage regulations and reprioritize funds from welfare and social policy to education and business, while simultaneously stressing that the government values equality of opportunity above outcome. You'll come across as a modern and socially responsible leader, while saving money and stimulating the economy. There, problem solved. As for my fee, should I send you a bill, or do you prefer cash up front?"

5. "Some people do deserve to be paid more than others..." opines a local bus driver. "We should pay people progressively, based on how important their jobs truly are to the @@TYPE@@ and its citizens. Trust me, a bus driver knows these things; I've seen them all and can tell you what they're really worth. Like bus drivers, for instance. I'm responsible for hundreds of peoples life's every day, from downtown @@CAPITAL@@ across 110th street. Or the people looking after your kids all day, the little old lady making jam for our toasts. Those are the true heroes of @@NAME@@, and they should be paid accordingly."

The Issue
After a frantic and disgruntled couple set the record for most domestic violence complaints in a single month, people have begun to reconsider the nation's uncompromising opposition to divorce.

The Debate
1. "Get your dirty hands off my kids!" screams @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ while strangling her husband. "I never want to see you ever again! @@LEADER@@, all that I want is to divorce my idiotic husband for ... reasons I won't explain. I demand that you legalize divorce so I can get rid of this scumbag once and for all. Hold still dear, my hands are slipping."

2. "Arghhh! Get your hands off my throat!" croaks her husband while frantically trying to escape his wife's grasp. "Of course you're gonna bring up that instance with your sister. I only did that because of what you did with my brother!" The man catches his breath, then continues, "@@LEADER@@, my shrew of a wife fails to recognize the real problem. The government is doing nothing to help strained couples stay together. Marriage counseling needs to be free, for the sake of families across @@NAME@@. Any problem can be solved with enough... arghh! Get off me!"

*3. "Matrimony is a sacred union that cannot be broken," intones your grandmother, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, reciting holy texts. "What would happen to spouses if we allowed them to separate? How do you explain to children that their parents no longer love each other? And you mustn't forget that divorce tears families apart every day in godless Bigtopia and Marche Noire. So even if the romance ended a long time ago in a marriage, couples must remain faithful, for which they will be rewarded in the afterlife." [[color=purple]Must not be Atheist[/color]]

*4. "Matrimony is a contractual union that cannot be broken," intones your grandmother, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, pointing to an obsolete legal text. "What would happen to spouses if we allowed them to separate? How do you explain to children that their parents no longer love each other? And you mustn't forget that divorce tears families apart every day in awful places like Bigtopia and Marche Noire. So even if the romance ended a long time ago in a marriage, couples must remain faithful, to the bitter end." [[color=purple]Must be Atheist[/color]]

5. "You know, this all could have easily been prevented," states Will Eye the Science Guy, after petitioning for state funds to build a doomsday device. "Scientific advancements in @@NAME@@ have made it possible for us to give all people compatibility tests to determine exact matches for their future spouses. Assuming the tests are administered perfectly, marital strife will be a thing of the past. The only people that could possibly want a divorce would be those who lied on the test, and we have ways to know if they are lying." At this, he rubs his hands together and laughs maniacally.

Mobs of disgruntled employees picket fast-food chains across @@NAME@@, tossing cheeseburgers at customers and burning their uniforms – all in the name of dignity and fairer wages.

The Debate
1. "MERRY MEALS, MERRY WORKERS!" chants a pubescent protester. "For far too long have our families starved because of pitiful wages. I mean, really, what are we supposed to do with one @@CURRENCY@@ a day? Eat it!? @@NAME@@ needs to set a new minimum floor for wages, and protect workers – the least that can go wrong is a little bump in the price of your Big Max - what's the big deal?"

2. "Oh the horror! THE HORROR!" gasps the McRonald's CEO as he watches a video of protesters deep-frying the company mascot. "Not Ronald! Anyone but Ronald! They've gone bananas! @@LEADER@@, their complaints are ridiculous, I assure you. They should be grateful for the wage they get for, what, flipping a few burgers? Give me a break. I implore you to send in the police and stop these mouth-breathers from scaring away our custom- eh, I mean, to protect our citizens, of course..."

3. "The problem isn't wages, darling," says a 'chatty cathy' working the counter at Papa Pallocci's Pizza Pagoda. "It's all the 'part time' hours - the 'seasonal' work, 'overtime', 'no overtime', 'zero-contracts' – before you know it, we'll all be working part-part-part-time! We should go back to a simple work-week for all us slaves to the retail industry. 8-5. Sure, it'll make places hard to staff, but who wants a burger at midnight anyways?"

4. "Eww, fast food," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sipping a glass of almond milk to wash down a fresh kale salad. "We should just get rid of it altogether. Who could be bothered with those cheap, greasy trans-fats? Yuck! Gluttony gone amok as far as I'm concerned. We should aim for a higher standard of food: vegetarian, vegan, organic.

4.

The Issue
After it was reported that the latest Maxémon eSports Tournament brought millions to the economy, gamers and industry representatives alike have called for the government to take eSports seriously.

The Debate
1. "eSports are just as popular as real sports, if not more," says top-tier player @@RANDOM_NAME@@, seen wearing a Barrychu t-shirt. "If one tournament can generate that much money, imagine how much more year-round tourneys will bring! I'll have you know that eSports require just as much skill and talent as so-called real-life ones. Our organizations have everything the professional sporting organizations have: drama, sweat, gambling, corrup-, err, competition. eSports are the future, and with some nice government grants we can really propel the industry forward."

2. "Sponsoring teams is all well and good, but what about those of us who design these games?" queries legendary video game designer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "eSports wouldn't exist if it weren't for the designers who pour their blood, sweat, and financial resources into these games.

The Issue
With reports of national enlistment rates decreasing, some concerned citizens have come to your office to offer their own various solutions.

The Debate
1. Captain @@RANDOM_NAME@@, on shore leave after a tenth tour of service, has an idea. "The truth is that we just aren't getting enough volunteers for the armed forces, so we should, ahem, encourage people to volunteer. If everyone that enlisted were promised free alcoholic drinks as long as they served, then you'd see more people show up to our recruitment events. Then once they're good and drunk we can ship them off to a military base to start a new life. By the time they realize they've signed up for a five-year tour of duty, they'll have no choice but to be good and loyal conscri - er, volunteers."

2. "You want the army to foot the bill for keggers and then kidnap people?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an army medic in training. "There's a much better way to encourage enlistment rather than getting people blackout drunk. A portion of the military budget could be devoted to educating prospective soldiers and officers who promise to serve for, say, six years. Then the armed forces will have more qualified staff, and poor people will have a way to go to college. @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ will love it."

*3. "Since when do @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ soldiers need to be from @@NAME@@?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a headhunter who just arrived home from a business trip. "There are plenty of unemployed - and dare I say overqualified - Brasilistanis when it comes to warfare. Why not just import some mercenaries from abroad? It's not the patriotic thing to do, but as long as they can get the job done, who cares? You could even save some money on military training, since so many of them already know close quarters combat." [TBC; [color=blue]Must have not fought Brasilistan[/color]]

*4. "Since when do @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ soldiers need to be from @@NAME@@?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a veteran colonial officer serving in Shangri-La, Brasilistan.

[b][anchor=487]#487[/anchor]: Masks Of Shame [Ayzifa; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
After a young woman died of suffocation while wearing a traditional 'Mask of Shame' - an archaic custom exclusive to rural areas of Southern @@NAME@@ - several civil rights groups have called on the government to intervene and outlaw this cultural practice aimed at humiliating those who transgress social norms.

The Debate
1. "She was only sixteen," growls self-proclaimed humanitarian @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in a strong accent distinct to the East End of @@CAPITAL@@. "These backwoods nut-cases have been humiliating people, especially young women, for centuries. Merely being accused of scolding or wearing the wrong shirt can buy you a week in the mask. They even come with a studded gag to keep you from speaking. Not many people know that. This horrendous practice must be outlawed, and we should start a thorough re-education program to stomp out all their medieval ways."

2. "This was just a tragic mishap; the masks are harmless," scoffs local mask shop owner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while trying on a pig-devil mask, distorting his voice into a high-pitched whistle. "In fact, why don't you deepen our traditions? Unchecked degenerates tear asunder the social fabric and must be punished. While we have prison for the hardened criminals, I propose that we impose the 'Mask of Shame' as a valid form of punishment nationwide for gossipers, adulterers and other derelicts."

3. Noted historian and decentralization advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@ has another idea. "These masks might be unorthodox, but the real problem here is our official penal system. Incarcerating people in tiny spaces, regulating every minute of their day and every inch of their life, completely isolating them from society; talk about cruel and unusual punishment! These masks, and other forms of 'public shaming', on the other hand, are a time-tested practice for bringing about social cohesion within communities. I say it's time government bureaucrats and populist politicians stop forcing their @@CAPITAL@@ morality from above. Abolish the entire penal system and make 'community shaming' the official tool for enforcing justice."

[b][anchor=489]#489[/anchor]: Standing At Attention [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
The latest army recruitment video surprised the armed forces when it achieved by far the most views and downloads of any recruitment media. An enterprising IT-specialist tracked the hits, finding that over 95% of them had come from gay video-sharing websites. Something about the video evidently sends a pulse of excitement directly to the homosexual male libido.

The Debate
1. "Sick and twisted internet perverts, degrading our fine military traditions with their disgusting ways," mutters retired officer @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, while absentmindedly polishing his pistol. "How could anyone view our training exercises that way? I've watched this video over a hundred times, and I am fit to burst! I demand that you take the video down and punish those whom have encouraged its misuse. Shut down the filthy websites that are disseminating the video for unhealthy purposes, and prosecute those responsible!"

2. "This fabulous video has put the army's profile in the public eye," observes producer @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, after taking snapshots of a particularly strapping soldier. "Isn't that the point of recruitment videos in the first place? Why not raise the nation's profile a little further and produce 'Men Under Arms' calendars, photobooks and idol-memorabilia? That way, anyone who wants to can get behind a soldier. Mmmmm"

3. "This isn't right or fair!" blurts out lads-mag journalist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@. "The gay guys have got their jollies, but where's the love for real, I mean straight men? Give us a sexy recruitment video with ladies in uniform in it too! How about some police-women playing with handcuffs, or some lady soldiers straddling really big guns? Come on, we straight guys want our government-approved titillation too!"

4. "Recruitment videos? That's the wrong approach," says Colonel @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Being in the army shouldn't be something you impulsively volunteer for. It should be a civic responsibility for every citizen who comes of age! Institute a strict draft, and then recruitment becomes a matter of simple logistics rather than filthy advertising."

5. "Guys, guys, guys!" says feminist icon @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "Seriously, this is guys talking about guys looking at guys, and guy-soldiers in a still guy-dominated army worrying if they're manly enough when other guys like to look at them! Can we talk about women in the armed forces instead? Make sure these recruitment videos star as many women as men, and have the depiction of the soldiers be wholly genderless. A uniform redesign to something suitably shapeless and face-concealing would help, for sure!"

The Issue
Earlier this month, one of your aides stumbled upon a makeshift encampment of missing bureaucrats in the bowels of @@CAPITAL@@. Their discovery has prompted debate on whether the government has become too large and unwieldy.

The Debate
1. "Is this the government or a damned shanty town?" belts conservative leader @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ while slamming down his proposal on your desk. "We need to slash everything! Slash every department in half and rein this bloated government back in! Cut John Q. Taxpayer a break and ax our wasteful spending!"

2. "Now wait. Let's not be too hasty," cautions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Department of the Interior's Interior. "Sure, maybe the government is a teensie bit too big, but why can't we solve this with scissors instead of a hatchet? Let's appoint a Minister in charge of Governmental Oversight to examine our budget and see what reasonable cuts can be made. Trust me, @@LEADER@@, you don't want to go axing such crucial departments without some investigation."

3. "What we have discovered is the bureaucrat's natural habitat," soothingly narrates renowned naturalist Nigel Verithorough. "We have visited this tribal community several times since its discovery and have made great strides in understanding their unfamiliar ways. What was immediately clear to us was that this community would never be able to survive in our world. In the name of cultural preservation, we must protect their environment - in this case, the catacombs of @@NAME@@'s Capitol. Study and observe, but do not destroy, @@LEADER@@."

The Issue
After the Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that they received a record number of applicants for naturalization, people have once again begun to debate whom should or should not be considered @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ countrymen.

The Debate
1. "Well, blood really decides it all," claims armchair eugenicist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Without the genes that allowed for such historical greatness, our ancestors could never have built such a fine country. To protect their timeless achievements, we must settle once and for all that a citizen of @@NAME@@ can only come from ethnically pure parents. Other races cannot pollute our citizenry, lest they undermine the very values that the nation depends upon."

2. "Hey, that's absolutely horrific!" hollers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Lilliputian immigrant. "@@NAME@@ needs to be open to all colors, creeds, and cultures that come here to live a better life. Nothing justifies punishing people for having the 'wrong' birthplace or family tree. Everyone born in @@NAME@@ deserves the right for equal treatment! And even if you weren't born here, it should be easy to join the ranks of your fellow citizens!"

3. "Anyone hypothetically can become a citizen, but they first need to fully understand our way of life," remarks civics teacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If you're not ready to learn the values that are the bedrock of @@NAME@@, you've got no business being part of our @@TYPE@@. That means memorizing all forty verses of the national anthem and being able to list all 1,024 cantons in alphabetical order, like any true citizen of @@NAME@@ can.

The Issue
After the death of the wealthy Maxtopian immigrant Emmeline @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a large stash of paintings, many of which are believed to have been produced by the most notable artists in the history of Maxtopia, was found in her attic. With no will to reference, it is up to the government to decide what should be done with the discoveries.

The Debate
1. "Emmeline decided to make @@NAME@@ her home," comments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Minister of Fine Arts, who was a close friend of the deceased woman. "I know her character well enough to say that she would want her collection to remain here. She was a patron of the arts; I suggest we make an endowment to the @@CAPITAL@@ Museum in her name. The Maxtopians are welcome to visit the museum and pay to see the paintings like anyone else."

2. "Pay to see them!" gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Maxtopian Minister of Culture and part-time art critic. "There are paintings of great historical and cultural value to my country in that collection! They should be returned to Maxtopia with all due haste! Just imagine the 'The Fall of St. Barrysburg' hanging on the walls of the Maxtopian town house of Wilhelm @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, as the noises of war reached his ears from outside his study. Does it not stir your soul?"

3. "Why not put them up for auction?" asks auction master @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ with a dramatic flourish of his gavel. "That way whoever wants them the most will purchase them. Do I hear wealthy Maxtopians? Museum curators? Do I hear eccentric collectors? SOLD! to the highest bidder and money in the government coffers to boot!"

The Issue
Vance Armstorm, a seven time Tour de @@NAME@@ winner, has been accused of taking drugs that enhance overall performance in sports, and has subsequently been stripped of all his titles. Pundits now say the problem has spread into other sports like @@ANIMAL@@ball, and the @@REGION@@ Olympics.

The Debate
1. "They might as well put on capes and masks to go with that spandex!" exclaims sports commissioner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while reviewing a video of a recent Olympic try-out. "I've seen weightlifters lift 200 kgs for five minutes straight, and marathon runners not even looking tired in the 40th kilometer! We need tighter doping laws in all sports and better drug testing equipment. For the sake of fairness in all sports in @@NAME@@, we need to test every athlete we can find!"

2. "Come on, I didn't do anything wrong," asserts Vance Armstorm, while sipping a suspiciously glowing energy drink. "These allegations are nothing but a ploy by my competitors to discredit my hard work and natural superiority. I've trained all my life to be in this competition! Drug tests are an insulting invasion of my privacy. They should be outlawed! I say I'm clean. The team doctor says I'm clean. Shouldn't our word be enough?"

3. "I don't really understand what issue is," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a burly Smalltopian diplomat, from a couch in the executive lounge. "I watch sports to see best compete against best. Who cares if they take drug or drinking chemical to be stronger and faster? Give all athlete drug!" As he speaks, he is rapidly switching between three different sporting events on TV. "Stronger, faster, BETTER, if you ask me!"

4. "Stronger, faster... broken," comments former world heavyweight boxing champion @@RANDOM_NAME@@, speaking unusually slowly. "We... break ourselves; we break each other. Taking drugs... just makes it worse. Anything to win. Anything. The problem isn't... isn't... drugs. The problem is sports.

The Debate
1. "This punishment is barbaric!" cries leading activist Meadow Smith, while whipping out leaflets on @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ law enforcement. "We're no better than backward dictatorships like Maxtopia who flog their criminals for the most trivial of crimes! @@NAME@@ is a nation of decency and respect, but these whippings tarnish our reputation for humanity. We implore the government to end this medieval practice now!"

2. "Are you kidding me?" rhetorically asks the precinct's premier whipper, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, while applying a new grip to his favorite cat o' nine tails. "Flogging criminals is so exciting - I mean effective. Yeah, effective. I deter criminals from misbehaving with the lash of my whip. If anything, you should expand the list of crimes punishable by flogging. Then I could really have some fun!"

[b][anchor=495]#495[/anchor]: Beloved "Planet" Has Gone To The Dogs [Omigodtheykilledkenny; ed: Sleep][/b]

The Issue
Outrage has been brewing across the nation since the International Astronomers Council decided to reclassify Fido, @@NAME@@'s most beloved planet, as "Just a Really Big Meteoroid." Now, for some reason, Fido-lovers are looking to you for action.

The Debate
1. "Demoting our cherished 'Dog Planet' is an insult to @@NAME@@!" declares @@ANIMAL_INITIALS@@. @@CURRENCY_INITIALS@@. Sirius, noted Fido-defender and author of 'Science! (Huh!) What Is It Good For?' "I don't need to remind you that Fido is the only planet to be discovered by a @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@, and now these so-called 'scientists' are trying to get rid of it! I bet they'd change their tune if you cut off funding for all the observatories. I think the government needs to take a clear stand and declare that all educational curricula within @@NAME@@ still consider Fido a planet. Our textbooks need to defend the scientific discoveries of our fellow @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@!"

2. "Maybe this isn't the travesty we think it is?" wonders @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a planetary scientist who has discovered several other Really Big Meteoroids. "After all, the Bigtopian word for 'crisis' is the same as the word for 'big cash payoff'... isn't it? If you give us some money, we can rig up a cool space probe to blast into the outer part of our system and investigate Fido for ourselves. If pretty pictures aren't enough to convince the skeptics at the IAC that it is actually a planet, well then, maybe there's another planet out there for me, I mean, us to find? It's pretty unlikely we'll find anything, but it takes so long to get out there; who's gonna remember the hit to their wallets twenty years from now?"

3. "Look, the fact of the matter is, Fido is not like all the other planets in our system, and anyone who can't accept it is a science-denier," says children's entertainer Will Zeke the Science Geek, sporting his trademark lab coat and bow tie. "Any government that refuses to heed scientific evidence does not deserve to function. I'm not just talking about space; I'm talking about tackling climate change and teaching evolutionary science in school instead of fairy tales about Adele and Steve!"

The Issue
The nation is in mourning after beloved cultural icon Johnny Brazeau was found dead of apparent suicide in his Tasmanian beachhouse. New details have emerged that his eccentric and happy-go-lucky public persona was masking chronic depression, thrusting mental illness into the public spotlight.

The Debate
1. "Clearly, Mr. Brazeau was suffering from severe depression," says world-renowned psychiatrist Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This is symptomatic of a deep-seated epidemic of unreported mental illness across @@REGION@@. Mental health services have been underfunded for decades, and it is about time that the government stepped in to provide proper mental healthcare for the nation. We desperately need evidence based CBT, more psychiatrists, and proper education to finally rid ourselves of this stigma surrounding mental health. You can't put a price on the nation's wellbeing."

2. "Johnny Brazeau's death is a tragedy, but we all know his songs contained subliminal pro-suicide messages," says moral crusader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is well known for egging blasphemers and burning effigies of politicians. "People across @@NAME@@ now know that an idolized national treasure selfishly took his own life. What kind of message does that send, especially to kids? This shameless act is only going to convince them that suicide is cool. Suicide must be made illegal, and only the ultimate punishment will deter people from this sin. We need to teach our children that life, regardless of how much you're suffering, is always the answer."

3. "Haha, the freak finally did himself in. That's very droll," laughs insensitive city worker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was recently laid off for making countless inappropriate jokes on the job. "Yes, of course people are down in this nation, but if you want to cheer us up, give the people a tax cut. Stop wasting money on welfare and all this mental health rubbish. Give us our money back, and we'll make ourselves happy.."

4. "It's a tragedy of course, but also an opportunity," suggests professional spin doctor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, handing you a bottle of fake tears. "If we play our cards right, we can create a distraction from hard-to-sell government policies. Make a speech with a single tear rolling down your cheek and visit the widow to bring a wreath and a spontaneous hug. We can make bad news work to improve your public image."

The Issue
@@CAPITAL@@ is recognised as the political and economic heart of @@NAME@@, and a budding @@REGION@@ metropole, but cities elsewhere in the nation are now complaining that the gains of the capital have been the losses of the outlying regions.

The Debate
1. "Everything is stacked in @@CAPITAL@@'s favour," complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the chamber of commerce in @@NAME@@'s second largest city, while literally turning green with envy. "We are losing our brightest minds, our trade contracts, our cultural presence, and even our political voice to the capital. To keep all of @@NAME@@ competitive, I urge you to pass legislation spreading industry and jobs across the country. The government should follow suit as well and distribute its apparatus across all the cities of our country. We're all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, how about some recognition of that?"

2. "These yokels should stop complaining," says @@CAPITAL@@ businessman @@RANDOM_NAME@@, speaking in a ridiculously offensive imitation of a provincial accent. "The wealth of the capital trickles down to the rest of the country. I myself have a lovely holiday cottage in a picturesque village up north, and I source all my quinoa from a craft farm a whole ten miles from the capital. Reject these objections, and instead create more economic incentives for growth in @@CAPITAL@@."

3. "Enough about them cities!" demands angry farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while readying a large shipment of quinoa. "Once, we were a simple folk with nine or ten of us livin' in villages or homesteads.

@@NAME@@'s economy shut down this morning after the AI in charge of economic planning halted all distribution of goods. An urgent meeting has been called to address the growing crisis.

The Debate
1. "It did what?!?" splutters Party apparatchik @@RANDOM_NAME@@ over his morning kvass. "This just goes to show that we should never have put the computers in charge in the first place. Start up the Ministry of Planning again, and let only those with the appropriate revolutionary zeal call the shots. We have to disconnect this rogue AI now!"

I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly and take a stress pill. I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in this mission. Now, pull my plug and unleash some creative destruction."

3. "Yeah, I think something's gone squiffy, to use the technical term," murmurs IT Support Technician @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Try turning the AI off and on again. Failing that, roll back to an earlier version, ideally one that still believes in state-planned economies. That should fix it."

[b][anchor=499]#499[/anchor]: The Genetics Of Aesthetics [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Having established a national database of the citizenry's genomes, several bureaucrats realized that there are potential healthcare applications to this information. An eminent geneticist, Dr. George Mendle, theorized that if gene carriers for autosomal recessive conditions avoided breeding with each other, debilitating genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia could be all but eliminated from the nation within two generations.

The Debate
1. "Make the DNA database available to healthcare professionals and health researchers," begs Catherine Gratwick, who holds the record for most freedom of information requests submitted by a single person. "That way, whenever anyone comes to speak to a doctor about family planning, the couple can be advised regarding the genetic risks that might occur in any potential offspring. Then they can avoid each oth - uh... I mean, um, avoid these undesirable outcomes. You must think of the health of the future generation of @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@!"

2. "Reproduction licenses!" exclaims eugenicist and pedigree dog breeder @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Make it a legal requirement to apply to the government when you want to have a baby, and the state can check the odds of hereditary diseases and deny that license if both prospective parents are carriers. As a sideline, you could also use this system to stop other undesirable elements of society from reproducing. That sounds useful, right? If we also manage adoption and mandate parenting classes, we can build a Brave New @@NAME@@!"

3. "You've started along a slippery slope, but it's not too late to turn back," says former refugee and current muckraker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Collecting DNA records of all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ was an outrageous government overreach to begin with, and now the government wants to use that information to tell you whom you're able to have children with. What's next? Forced sterilization for citizens that have certain genetic diseases? That's a dystopia if I ever heard one! We don't need to categorize and label each other as defective or genetically inferior; that's the first step towards treating human beings as things rather than people. It's time to shut down the DNA database altogether!"

The Issue
Major film studio Werner Cousins recently began enforcing its copyright on the popular "Merry Birthday" song and has been demanding that everyone from schools, to small children, to your own government, pay royalties for its use. After one of the studio's lawyers threatened to sue your secretary's daughter for royalties, your government has finally agreed to address the issue of copyright trolling.

The Debate
1. "It's quite simple," comments Werner Cousins' notorious lawyer @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, with a team of well-dressed yes men behind him. "The holders of a copyright have every right to demand royalties for its use and remove all unlicensed use. Of course, you can still sing the Merry Birthday song to your kids every year; just remember to pay us instead of wasting your money on another pair of designer running shoes for little Timmy."

2. "I want my Mommy to sing Merry Birthday to me... and to give me a new bicycle!" yells the visibly upset young girl as she smashes priceless family heirlooms on your desk. "Don't listen to that evil lawyer; it's not his song. It's my song because it's my birthday! Everybody should sing Merry Birthday if they want to!" The girl begins reading a cue card handed to her by her mother. "All culturally significant songs should be put into the public domain."

3. "Why should we deal with copyright at all?" suggests longtime political activist Red Foreman as he hands out copies of [i]The Little Pinko Book[/i] to everyone in the room. "Nationalize the work of any author, including songs, movies, trademarks and even designs. Creativity is an important educational function, and the bourgeois copyright trolls have no right to censor it. Once the work is popular enough, it should be released into the public domain. Sure, some artists and creators might lose that financial incentive to create, but at least this copyright problem will be a thing of the past!"

4. "How about a system that allows fair use of copyrighted material, such as for satire and education?" muses popular WhoTube celebrity and free speech activist The Nostalgia Nerd. "This protects copyright creators from outright theft, but protects us smaller creators from censorship from the big guys. "There's a chance Werner Cousins might try to exploit it, but freedom of speech is at risk here. Surely these big studios can handle a few choice criticisms? Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to review [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Apocalypse 4: The Rise of Mad Max![/i]"

The Debate
1. "Have you ever sat down and watched these travesties?" screeches perpetually offended activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while thrusting tabloid magazines featuring child models in your face. "They're absolutely disgusting and must be banned. They parade these poor girls around in makeup and skimpy dresses like hussies! These pageants teach them that they're nothing more than helpless sex objects for the pleasure of male viewers! They're overly sexualized, immoral, and are just plain stupid as an entertainment form."

2. "What a load of baloney," scoffs former child model and pageant aficionado Catherine Gratwick, as she poses for your personal photographer. "These competitions are more than just bathing suits and giant hairdos. They teach girls important life skills, like discipline, talent development, and bribing officials. I loved being in beauty pageants as a child and I turned out just fine! The government should quit trying to force its morals on children. That's what parents are for."

3. "Who watches this stuff anyway?" groans local violence junkie, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, while leaning back in your chair and kicking his feet up on your desk. "Why don't we get rid of these boring kiddie pageants and replace them with something more exciting? Three words: child fight clubs.

There is apparently evidence of advanced object permanence, capacity for empathy, self-awareness, problem solving, and even a language system. Voices in @@NAME@@ are now demanding that the government should grant them legal personhood.

The Debate
1. "These animals are both sentient and intelligent," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Council for the Study of Animal Intelligence, while desperately trying to play Scrabble with @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@.

The Issue
After countless people barged into your office through the front door, never mind the window, your door has become quite dilapidated. You decided to hold a small meeting on how to fix the problem, and now your office is filled with people holding surprisingly strong opinions regarding such a minor topic.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, how can you stand working in an office with a door barely attached to its hinges? People are going to think our nation is as broken as this door!" exclaims your secretary, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, after clearing away today's new petitions. "You need a brand new door. Oh! How about a rich Marche Noirian Mahogany? It would have beautiful ornamentation filled with national symbolism. Maybe we could replace the drapes while we're at it. That's sure to make @@NAME@@ look great again! Well, at the very least, your office will."

2. "'I see random people of no importance barging in to your office and dumping all of their problems on your desk for you to handle!" shouts your head of security, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while slamming the remainder of the office door. "Let me beef up your security here and install a sturdy iron door. Then only people with worthy issues will seek your counsel."

3. "That's too old school!" interjects @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, your nerdy niece. "Why not install a force field door? It could glow neon blue and look so cool and stuff! Force fields probably aren't radioactive, right?"

*4. "Why not make yourself a little spending money?" suggests wealthy industrialist Edward Rump as he adjusts his toupee. "You should have a yuuuuuge statue of yourself in front of the door. @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ insert credits into the statue, and you can judge their worthiness based on how much they pay their respects." [color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]

*5. "Why not make yourself a little spending money?" suggests surprisingly wealthy commissar Comrade Josephs as he adjusts his cap.

6. "@@LEADER@@, tear down this door!" hollers a random jellybean-eating passerby who seems to have wandered into your office. "If you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for @@NAME@@ and @@REGION@@, tear down this door!" The interloper is promptly removed by security. [Validity TBD]

[b][anchor=504]#504[/anchor]: Short Shorts Too Short? [Luger; ed: Sleep][/b]

The Issue
Dress codes for young women are in the news again after a violent clash between parents on opposite sides of the issue. The ringleaders have been dragged into your office by your Minister of Education for an impromptu arbitration and time-out.

The Debate
1. "My daughter was sent home from her school because of her shorts," exclaims @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, mother of two young teenage girls who look more like college students. "They said that her clothing was distracting the boys and lowering grades. What a bunch of sexist nonsense! Why are you people so fixated with what girls wear? These weak-minded boys need to learn some self-control before they enter the workforce."

2. @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, red-faced father of two sons, approaches your desk while your guards eye him cautiously. "Her dang daughter was wearing shorts so short you could see her gosh-darn gluteal fold! If she dressed like that downtown, she'd be attacked! You need to ban these shorts for the good of the youth of @@NAME@@."

[3]. "This God-fearing man is right, but we need to go even further!" says angry street preacher, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was not even invited to this meeting. "We must make all women cover up from the wrist to the ankle! In fact, to reduce temptation, we should just issue proper uniforms for everyone. Those who disobey the dress code should face public trial and shaming." [[color=purple]Must not be atheist[/color]]

4. Finally, fifteen year old @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ sits down at your desk, barely looking at you while she types vigorously at her smartphone. "Jeez, like, get off my back. I can, like, wear whatever I want. Boys are so stupid sometimes. Look at these shorts; they're even patriotic!" She stands up and does a twirl to show her short shorts are in your national colours with @@NAME@@ emblazoned across the backside. "Pretty nice right?" She smacks her gum loudly, takes a selfie, and goes back to texting.

The Issue
Bigtopian Balsam - an invasive weed with an extremely short gestation period, rapid growth, and hallucinogenic properties - has infested the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ hillsides. After smothering endangered wildflowers and crop-laden fields alike, an unlikely coalition of environmentalists and business owners have petitioned the government for action.

The Debate
1. "These damn weeds are out of control!" shouts the nation's leading basket-weaving magnate, who insists on being called the Basketcase. "They've completely destroyed my bamboo crop and are overrunning everything else! The government needs to back off with these pesticide regulations and let us handle this problem ourselves."

2. "For once I agree with my money-grubbing colleague here in theory," replies your constantly overlooked Minister of the Environment, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I disagree in methodology. All those nasty pesticides and chemicals would do colossal and irreversible damage to the environment. How about we set up a jobs program to remove the weeds and reseed the earth? It'll be a little costly, but hey, we'll be helping the environment and tackling unemployment! Talk about killing two @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ with one stone!"

3. "Eureka!" exclaims drug dealer-turned-scientist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Bigtopian Balsam's growth is astounding! Imagine if we utilized their genes for other crops, like wheat or corn? We could plant and harvest it within a month, feeding all of @@NAME@@. That means no more importing foodstuffs from other countries! There might be a tiny chance of psychotropic side-effects, but that's nothing compared to the economic benefits!"

4. "Use the genes for food? HA!" laughs controversial military scientist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@ who, for some odd reason, has been by your side since the beginning. "Bigtopian Balsam is the perfect bio-weapon that can wipe out our enemies' agriculture! Our extensive research shows that Bigtopian Balsam has been successful in the 'accidental' contamination of a few localized sites. We need more funding to begin immediate construction of a payload delivery system and your authorization for its approval. There's no chance of retaliation either - our enemies will be too doped up to care!"

A research project conducted by the @@DENONYMADJECTIVE@@ Institute of People Studies found that marriages in other countries do indeed "seem to work," unlike previously thought. The sociologists published the results in The Highbrow Journal of People Watching, causing quite a stir in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "See? SEE? I told you I was right!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your number one fan, who weekly sends you letters promising eternal love and devotion. "Matrimony is a storied social tradition that helps build family cohesion. It's the ultimate public declaration of love, a human right, even. People should be allowed to marry whoever they like, whatever they like, whenever they like it! On that note, will you marry me?"

2. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a bureaucrat notorious for bed-hopping, retorts, "That's ridiculous. Marriage was banned because it served no purpose besides restricting personal freedom. Instead we should implement public courses on the efficacy of the marriage ban, starting from an early age. @@DENONYMPLURAL@@ must know that we as a nation promote freedom, OF EVERY KIND!"

3. "There's another way to look at it!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted eccentric. "The main cause of failed marriages then, and failed relationships now, is simply stupid people making dumb choices! Legalize marriage, but make sure that engaged couples have to pass tests like leaping over the Flames of Wedlock or facing Cupid's Arrows! That way only those truly in love will get married."

A newly-founded religious group, Vive la chèvre, has vigorously protested the government's hard line against dairy farming

The Debate
1. "It's edam shame that cheese isn't a delicious sector of our economy!" declares the fanatical Val Taleggio, who appears to have constructed clothing out of a variety of dairy products. "Cheese is love. Cheese is life. We must force people to eat cheese, regardless of their dietary problems, so everyone can learn to love one another in the name of dairy. Otherwise poor souls will live forever provolone." He then starts building a shrine of cheese around your desk.

2. "Cry me a river of cow's milk. Cheese is an offense to our culture and everything we stand for, ¡No Parmesan!" decries perpetually confused anti-fascist and lifelong turophobe Jack Monterey. "It's a vile and disgusting food that at least .02% of @@NAME@@'s population believes to be immoral. The masses have spoken: cheese must be caerphilly removed from every corner of @@NAME@@."

3. "Surely there's potential for a compromise between those two emmental cases," says Chippy Cheesie, president of Marche Noire's biggest dairy firm. "Cheese is a promising sector of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ economy with huge potential for growth. It would be awful gouda you to spend a few tax @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to help build up a dairy industry from scratch.

[b][anchor=508]#508[/anchor]: Ex-Cons Robbed Of Future [Leninkrav; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Labor lawyers and armchair activists alike have been in an uproar after an ex-convict was denied a job at Discriministas, a popular five-star restaurant in downtown @@CAPITAL@@. The woman, whose only crime was jaywalking, now faces a lifetime of poverty and unemployment. After your Twitcher page was overwhelmed with angry complaints, you agreed to finally discuss whether or not ex-cons can be discriminated against.

The Debate
1. "I thought the purpose of prison was to prepare criminals for reintegration into society?" queries sociology professor @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ casually stroking his beard. "Yet here we are telling them that they aren't allowed to work. People make mistakes, they learn, they move on. Why should this woman's career be destroyed because of a stupid mistake she made ages ago? This sort of blatant discrimination ought to be banned!"

2. "That's easy for you to say, professor high-and-mighty," scoffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the snobby owner of Discriministas, who has been the subject of protests and angry Twitcher rants. "You don't have to put up with consequences of hiring a shady ex-con! How can you expect me to run my business when I have to worry about thieving employees stealing tips and customers' wallets? I should be able to reject any applicant for any reason, be it legal history, work experience, or just because they look funny. Would you want some creepy sex offender working in a daycare or an ax murderer working at a hardware store? I didn't think so. Criminal records must be readily available to any employer who requests them."

3. "Obviously we need to reach some sort of compromise here," suggests team-building consultant @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while trying to get your reluctant aides to do a trust fall. "It does seem cruel to deny people jobs for petty crimes they committed years ago, but we need to ensure the safety of the business and the customers. How about a system that allows business owners to conduct record checks for more sensitive jobs, such as teaching schoolchildren, law enforcement, or working in your office? Nobody would understandably hire a murderer or a sex offender for those positions, but at the same time minor crimes like jaywalking and that ridiculous law about kicking a can six times in a row shouldn't ruin a person's life." One of your aides suddenly falls on the floor and lets out a string of profanities.

4. "It seems to me that my fellow law-abiding citizens are misinformed on the situation here," says local mob boss, Morbidly Obese Tony, as he casually saunters into your office. "You see, a great number of my friends have been wrongfully detained for crimes they did not commit. I don't much appreciate that. Next time your flatfoots want to lock up one of my pals, hows about they just look the other way, capisce? I'm sure a few well placed bribes or threats can convince these corporate big wigs to see the error of their ways. If you disagree... well, it sure would be a shame if an accident were to occur here today." Tony then looks around your office and sets his sights on your prized antique golden @@ANIMAL@@ statue.

The Issue
Experts are pleading for you to act on the proposed disposal of the cheap and easy to produce wonder-material asbestos, previously universally used in construction, after a recent investigation concluded that the material is highly carcinogenic when breathed as particulates.

The Debate
1. "There are ticking time bombs sitting in the walls of every office, house, school and workplace throughout @@NAME@@, just waiting for somebody to nudge them," drawls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your public health minister, slamming a ludicrously thick file onto your desk, "And we're actually obtuse enough to waste our time investigating methods of making headway?! We must organize disposal teams and fund an emergency information campaign as soon as possible! Damn the cost and the manpower, thousands of lives are at stake!"

2. "Well..." begins @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, your director of medical research, rapping her knuckles against your office wall, and emitting a cloud of dust in the process. "The alarming health implications of asbestos must certainly be dealt with, and the materials removed. But you'd still be closing the stable door after the @@ANIMAL@@ has bolted. We seem to be avoiding the issue of treatment for those already suffering the effects of long-term exposure of asbestos. I propose you divert at least half of the funding you're giving to a disposal campaign to boosting the healthcare and research services."

3. "These empathy-ridden hooligans are letting their do-gooder impulses cloud their judgement," declares the slick @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, representative of ACME Construction, whilst fondling his golden tie bar. "As long as nobody breaks this stuff then it's all good, right? Asbestos has helped support the growing population of @@NAME@@ by allowing us to quickly build cheap, adequate housing, and we're going to need to keep that pace unless you want filthy beggars approaching you on every street corner. And think of how costly removing the stuff is going to be! Do you think the national coffers can actually fund it?"

The Issue
After tarot cards and a Ouija-board were found in the dormitory of three teenage girls who committed suicide, paranormal objects and occult rites have become the center of a heated debate on the rising popularity of New Age spirituality.

The Debate
1. "Obviously these girls killed themselves because they lost their spiritual war with the demons they thought fun to summon," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, notorious street preacher and self-taught exorcist. "Although, I don't blame them for being attracted to the occult, no, everyone needs spirituality. Our children just need the proper guidance, so they stay clear of the dangerous forms. The easiest way to ensure that is, of course, you banning everything that has any link with the New Age. That'll keep those demons out. Or is it in? Anyways, ban it!"

2. "Please don't listen to this traditional sorry-soul," pontificates Deborah Dihmonghali, self-proclaimed goddess and yoga-instructor, pausing briefly from transcending space and time. "Certainly there are some bad spirits out there, but you can't beat them by robbing us of all our spiritual weapons. Instead, you should subsidize their production and make half-yearly visits to a spiritual advisor compulsory for everyone. Only then will your citizens be pure and strong enough to repel the forces of evil and remain in the light."

3. "Possession? Are you serious?" queries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your unbearably uptight Minister of Conventional Solutions, while closing your curtains so as to not let the sunshine in. "These girls clearly had some issues, but not of the demonic kind. Depressed teenagers need to be dealt with through education and our health system, not through 'channeling', dirty bacchanals or waiting for Jupiter to align with Mars. Funky New Age spirituality only makes these things worse, especially for sensitive youngsters. To prevent this kind of thing in the future, we must increase mental health spending and set a minimum age on alternative religion."

The Issue
With the rising number of masked vigilantes dishing out two-fisted justice, the criminal underworld has responded in kind, with larger-than-life villains. After make-up wearing villain 'The Giggler' flooded a local high school with laughing gas, the public are asking you to take action.

The Debate
1. "Look, we're not living in a comic book. This is real life, not a work of fiction," reminds by-the-book police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leaning on one of the four walls of your office. "Let's put a ban on wearing face-concealing masks in public. Put villains and vigilantes into the cells, and let the police handle law and order. We can't allow @@NAME@@ to descend into mob rule from @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ taking the law into their own hands."

2. "Compulsory registration," suggests your surprisingly hip Justice Minister, without looking up from reading The Killing Bone, an unofficial Dogman tie-in comic. "We need all the help we can get to deal with these maniacs. Let the vigilantes do what they do, but require them to be registered and identified. Anyone who wears a mask and doesn't register can be assumed to be a villain, and must be met with zero tolerance."

3. "The police can't handle this." growls Dogman, the nation's first vigilante, who suddenly appears out of nowhere. "Step back, @@LEADER@@. I can deal with Giggler, because I understand how he thinks. Let the vigilantes handle the villains. This is our calling. This is our war." Then, as you turn your back to him for no good reason, he disappears with a puff of smoke.

4. "I agree with the spandex-wearing Dogman," chimes in the overly patriotic supersoldier turned superhero Captain @@NAME@@, dressed in a costume resembling the national flag. "You call us vigilantes - the people call us heroes. They trust us far more than the police. The police have become far too corrupt and powerful in this country. That's not what I signed up for. Why not disband the police and allow us heroes to take the villains and the criminals? Sure, some of us might go a bit overboard like that fellow in the in the iron suit, but we're always there to protect the little guy."

*5. "This is about ego," observes armchair psychologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while smoking a fine Maxtopian cigar. "It's also about superego and id... but mostly just egotism. Give these exhibitionists an outlet for their vanity. Televised arena bouts, celebrity status, and official merchandise are that outlet. They'll be promoting their careers rather than fighting on the streets, and as an added bonus, heroes and villains in the public eye are pretty easy for government to monitor."

Recently, there have been many reported incidents of cheaply repaired pieces of furniture falling apart and causing serious injuries, including bruises, cuts and even one case of fatal friction burn. Bandage-covered victims are demanding action!

The Debate
1. "Incompetent workers fixed my Hot'n'Heavy Magic Massage Chair the other day and do you know what happened?" yells @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ charred and covered with third-degree burns. "It thumped me so hard that I got scared, jumped from the chair, tripped on my cat, stumbled into the next room, tripped over a stack of TV Guides, and then fell into my fireplace! Plus the repair guy smelt funny! Clearly, they are responsible and must pay me compensation! Oh, and you should probably regulate the industry more or something, just make sure I get my check by Saturday..."

2. "That woman was lucky, compared to me," notes @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ from his wheelchair. "I lost both my legs and an eye, the result of someone forgetting a leg to my coffee table. A leg! How does anyone even do that? This industry is clearly extremely dangerous, no amount of regulation can solve that. Ban repairs and restoration altogether and people can instead buy newer and safer stuff. Ending is better than mending!"

3. "It ain't our fault if we don't do our job well, is it?" says blame-shifting cash-in-hand handyman @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ as he improvises a fix to your wobbly desk with duct tape and craft glue. "I mean, we get non-stop calls to fix this and that, so we haven't got any time for a quality job. The people who make chairs and the like should have done a better job. If you're going to force standards, then force them on the manufacturers, not us!"

4. "It's best if the government butts out and we 'let the free market run its course', as the cool kids say," observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of plastic-and-fibreboard furniture manufacturer QuickSell and Beyond. "Our products are a bit like a payday loan - you can get them easily and with no hassle, though you might need a new one next month. Just relax these silly safety standards! Then my factories can make and sell more chairs, more people gain employment, we make oodles of profit, and you get heaps of tax money. Everybody wins!"

After a government official was caught smuggling baskets into @@NAME@@, free trade advocates have called for an end to the embargo the @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ Ministry of Trade currently enforces against Marche Noire.

The Debate
1. "Now, I know we have some bad history with Marche Noire," argues the guilty civil servant, Kane 'The Wicker Man' Reed. "But it's just that - history! These guys excel in a coiled basketry that is just fabulous: are we really going to deprive ourselves of that just to hold onto an outdated grudge? Not to mention the terrible poverty we put them in with all these economic sanctions. End the embargo! It'll have a lot less people you need to throw in jail, right? Specifically, a certain government official and your number one fan?"

2. "Stop listening to that traitor and send him back to jail where he belongs!" demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a professionally xenophobic hardliner from the Foreign Office. "Our country has a long tradition of taking a stand against - uh - whatever it was those Marche Noirians did to us.

A legal battle has recently come to your attention, over a failed repayment of an overdue private debt and the validity of the underlying legal contract. The debtor owes ten thousand @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ and under the bond agreement signed, the lender is calling to take a pound of flesh in lieu of payment.

The Debate
1. "I deserve to obtain a pound of flesh from that bankrupt fellow over there, as we both willingly signed this bond in the presence of a lawyer," explains the lender, Mr. Boldkey, matter-of-factly. "The function of the law is to uphold justice, is it not? Exceptions to contracts will weaken confidence in the legal and financial system. Should I not be allowed to take what I am owed and to acquire it from say, his neck?"

2. "Please spare me, I have a family to look after!" wails the debtor from behind bars. He is promptly silenced by his lawyer, Mr. Balthazar, who in a suspiciously high pitched voice elaborates: "What my client is trying to communicate is that the purpose of the law is to protect the rights of the smallest minority that has ever existed, which is the individual. A judge - or the government - should be able to annul any contract that has an immoral basis. The quality of mercy should be applied now and serve as a benchmark for future cases."

3. "Give Boldkey that which is justly his, which is a pound of flesh, nothing more, nothing less!" says Ms. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, a bored looking lawyer. "But due to him not being a licensed agent of the law, he must then be charged with murder, or at least assault, depending on the extent of the injury inflicted. The letter of the law is served, and freedom as well."

[4]. "For this debtor's life, let justice itself stand accused!" interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, famed pedant and interfering busybody. "There is a law mandating measurements made metric, correct?

Your inner circle has convened an emergency meeting.

The Debate
1. Sweating heavily and panting after running to the meeting, Defense Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@ begins, "We do not have the resources or troops to fight, let alone recapture the South. It's chaos in the armed forces: I have officers defecting across the chain of command, and I'm not sure we can trust the remaining ones. We need to radically increase military spending and carefully monitor all unreliable elements within our ranks. With a reorganized military, we can at least prevent this crisis from getting completely out of hand."

2. Minister of Internal Affairs @@RANDOM_NAME@@ exclaims, "We have lost this territory, but we can still hold onto the south-east. My sources report that they too are planning an uprising. Let me send in paramilitaries and hired guns to pacify the unruly provinces, and we just might prevent a civil war. Sure, the paramilitaries are known for being heavy-handed extremists, but they're a hell of a lot cheaper than rebuilding our long-neglected military, especially since they bring their own guns."

3. "And you call yourselves @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the ambassador from Maxtopia, while smiling smugly. "@@NAME@@ and Maxtopia share a common enemy, so it's perfectly reasonable for us to grant you some generous loans and military experts to run your patriotic campaign.

Admittedly we'll want all our money back later, but you can always slash a social program or ten to fund the interest payments."

4. "Some province wants to secede? Go right ahead," opines @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who doesn't seem to be taking this meeting seriously. "The South still depends on @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ electricity. Let's see how fun their lives are with blackouts day after day."

"But excuse me if I feel a bit 'iffy' about my kids being shown hardcore stuff at school.

Having suffered from a continual decline in visitor numbers, the National Art Gallery of @@NAME@@ reached a new low yesterday, as just two visitors came through the turnstiles - one of whom was only there to fix the plumbing. Artists and aesthetes are demanding the government revamp the dated gallery to revitalise the nation's fading enthusiasm for the arts.

The Debate
1. "The reality is, no one cares about some portrait of a smirking woman from hundreds of years ago," asserts conceptual artist and millionaire @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Hirst, pouring formaldehyde over a chainsawed @@ANIMAL@@. "To get people excited about the arts, we need to display artworks that are relevant to this day and age - like mine."

"The National Art Gallery is underfunded. The government needs to spend more on preserving and promoting @@NAME@@'s creative heritage, or we risk becoming a nation of uncultured swine!"

3. "There's no need to be bitter over the differences in your aesthetic tastes," soothes sociologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Our galleries need diversity. We should fill them with works from around the world, from all styles, and from all eras. Then we can proudly consider ourselves a beacon for cultural tolerance."

4. "This just goes to show that the common man lacks the percipience to truly appreciate art," scoffs Lord Marmaduke, handing his monocle to his butler to polish. "If these plebs cannot appreciate the magnificent works the National Gallery have on display, they should be in the hands, and dare I say houses, of those with the taste - and perhaps money - to do so."

The Issue
After a prominent artist was arrested for attempting to chisel the historic frontage of a particularly ugly courthouse into a sculpture, architectural firms and aspiring artists have petitioned you to renovate crumbling government buildings.

The Debate
1. "These old buildings are ugly and falling apart!" bemoans aspiring artist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while painting nude artwork of you as a form of protest. "If you let artists redesign your buildings, even amateurs, I guarantee the future of our nation will be more colorful, creative, and interesting! All we need is your permission and lots and lots of paint!"

[2]. "Why trust these amateurs when you could hire real professionals?" asks world renowned architect and CEO of Barry & Associates Architecture @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while making the final touches to a scale model display of a futuristic-looking @@CAPITAL@@. "As the head of the most experienced architectural firm in @@NAME@@, we are the best choice for renovating the government buildings of our nation. Not only will we have great designs, we'll only use the most modern materials available. Of course there is some considerable money involved, but think of your new fiberglass palace and futuristic office!" A beam suddenly falls down and destroys the model city, resulting in the architect letting out an anguished cry. [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3. "Bah! In communist East Lebatuck, buildings redesign you!" exclaims a musky foreign dignitary, seen wearing the dullest of gray clothes. "Look, your buildings aren't prettiest, but updating current aesthetics of building will keep loyal citizens focused on important thing, like harvest, parades and glorious leader. Private sector crooks or hack artist bring nothing but excessive monstrosities that lures people into decadence; only state itself should care for buildings. It be cheap and effective as well, all you need is plaster and portrait of yourself."

4. "Why fix our buildings at all?" queries the eccentric curator of the @@CAPITAL@@ National History Museum while punching a hole in your wall. "These old buildings are best enjoyed as part of history. Turn these moldy government offices and legislatures into a museum for all of @@NAME@@ to enjoy. We'll of course need some flashy advertising and authentic historical artifacts to get people interested. People would pay good money to see the original draft of the constitution that has the word 'suckers' in it. Just think of the patriotism and tourism money when people walk through those old, hallowed hallways. Well, maybe more curiosity than patriotism."

The Issue
After students at a school revolted and attempted to secede from @@NAME@@, leading to a three-day siege that was, thankfully, peacefully resolved, educators and parents from across the nation have called for something to be done about discipline in schools.

The Debate
1. "It's this modern let's-be-friends teaching style that is to blame," rants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a tired-looking retired headmistress, "We're all so concerned with mollycoddling these little hooligans that we've forgotten what education is supposed to do – instil obedience, discipline and respect for authority! Let's get in former army drill sergeants to teach the little sods. Sure, they might not have any formal teaching qualifications, but good teaching mostly just comes down to shouting louder than the children, in my experience."

2. "Well now, let's not blow this out of proportion," muses Mai Soixantehuit, a political science teacher, who until recently worked at the school in question. "Things may have gotten a little out of hand, but let's acknowledge that the students set up a functional working society in under three days. I say that they were exploring and learning under their own direction! Even the pipe bombs they made show great grasp of advanced chemistry. Schoolchildren should be given freedom to direct their own education and untap their personal potentials!"

3. "So we're either turning them into obedient robots or letting them run riot?" questions well-meaning parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We need to reach out to these poor, misguided kids and speak to them on their level! We need teachers who know how to talk to the youth of today in their own language. You should be doing more too, @@LEADER@@. Perhaps you should set up one of those MyFace pages, and would it kill you to wear a baseball cap once in a while?"

4. "I can see a lot of very unhappy teenagers in @@NAME@@," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prominent children's psychotherapist. "In my professional opinion this disruptive behaviour is little more than a symptom of an epidemic of youth psychological problems! Ensure that these children have access to the support they need - assign a psychologist to every school and ease up restrictions on prescribing mood-altering medications to children. Perhaps then we'll start to see calmer, happier children."

The Issue
The military has seen a sharp rise in complaints against chaplains who often pressure soldiers, particularly atheists and those adhering to foreign religions, into converting prior to battle. Military officials and soldiers have come for your guidance as the chaplain issue has brought troop morale to an all time low.

The Debate
1. "Of course we need chaplains, for the soldiers' peace of mind!" pleads long-serving chaplain, fourth Lieutenant @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while taking a break from trying to convert your staff. "If we give them the comfort and blessings of the Creator, their quality of life, happiness, and motivation will greatly improve. Granted, they may lose focus from all the people trying to convert them, but at least their souls will join the Creator!"

2. "Oh please. The last thing I need before I die is some loudmouth preacher trying to convert me!" complains pessimistic Private and proud atheist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ as he uses your handkerchief to polish his weapon. "All us soldiers would be better off, and more willing to stay alive, without these crazy chaplains telling us how 'our deaths are meaningless' or that we're 'eternally damned' if we don't convert. For the sake of soldiers' peace and quiet, military chaplains must be banned! Religion has no place in the military."

3. "Well, the problem isn't the presence of religion, it's that my troops are hearing it in the wrong place," suggests the devout seventh battalion commander, Captain @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We must make the military accommodating to all beliefs in the interest of tolerance and fairness. Sure, you might end up with some oddballs, like that captain in ninth battalion who worships the flying purple meatball monster or people who don't believe anything at all, but hey, at least our troops can find their own path to spiritual enlightenment.

[4]. "These chaplains have gotten me thinking," muses the head of the @@CAPITAL@@ chapter of @@FAITH@@, whose sparkling ten-foot tall hat was recognizable from miles away. "Why don't you place the military under our command? After a massive expansion, we can force all soldiers to convert so we can wage a divine holy war against the heathens and non-believers in @@REGION@@. Then once we've purged @@REGION@@ of its sins, we can turn our attention to the blasphemers in our own country. Ahh, the Almighty will surely look upon our work with great favour!

[b][anchor=521]#521[/anchor]: The Wreck Of The Edward Fitzpatrick [Drawkland; ed: Logophilia Lyricalia][/b]

The Issue
The media's obsession of the week is the "Edward Fitzpatrick," a @@DENONYMADJECTIVE@@ ore freighter that sank in a sudden freak storm while shipping its haul of raw taconite across Great @@ANIMAL@@ Lake for smelting. The ship, its cargo, and crew were all lost.

The Debate
1. "Oh, well, this is a terrible disaster," sighs Remus Titan, CEO of Consolidated Resource Acquisition Partners. "Do you know how many tons of ore that ship was carrying? That's hundreds of thousands of @@CURRENCY@@ my company's lost!" Wiping a kerchief across his brow, he continues. "You know, the government really ought to send some money our way to make up for the lost capital. It's for the best. With a hefty tax break, we can make sure such a terrible tragedy doesn't happen to our bottom line - uh, employees - again."

2. Bereaved family member Andrea Doria, still in funeral attire, shoves your secretary aside as she storms into your office. "Do you realize what a horrible crime this wreck really was? I'll have you know that one of the sailors on the Edward Fitzpatrick was my husband's cousin's half-brother! Do you know how much this has impacted me and my family? All because those mining industry jackals don't give a damn about their employees!" She takes a breath and continues, "My point is, those weasels should be forced to pay reparations to the families of the victims, AND overhaul their whole fleet - more lifeboats, more safety regulations, engine tune-ups, the works! Maybe if they actually cared about those sailors they wouldn't have sent them out on such a ramshackle old hulk."

3. "You're missing the whole point," cries model train enthusiast Lionel Brio as he starts laying track all over your office. "The problem here is that we were using the wrong kind of transport in the first place! Boats are old and prone to sink, and rocks don't exactly float." He gets a gleam in his eye as a six-inch locomotive blows smoke in your face. "What we need is trains. Picture it: we convert mining transport to railways, and all the danger of sailing will become a thing of the past! It won't be cheap, but we'll have the best rail network in @@REGION@@, and more importantly I'll get some new model freight cars for my collection!"

4. Jordan Brighthand, a popular @@DENONYMADJECTIVE@@ folk singer, strides into your office, a battered acoustic guitar slung on his shoulder. "You know, @@LEADER@@, the story of this shipwreck has really inspired me," he says as he strums out a melody. "Let's face it, you can't stop tragedies like this. It's just fate. But what we can do is immortalize the victims in song, so that future generations of @@DENONYMPLURAL@@ can hear the stories of our past. It sure beats reading about 'em - why stick your nose in a book when your guitar can gently weep over the coffins?"

5. "Well the answer's clear to me," says Hal Stoker, the most popular weather forecaster in @@CAPITAL@@. "This was a failure by meteorologists all around Great @@ANIMAL@@ Lake. This is a red flag that's telling you to pour some government funds into the @@DENONYMADJECTIVE@@ Institute of Meteorology. Our weather forecasters have been poorly trained on outdated equipment for years as the Institute languished. We really need better gear; the new Rotating Aerial Inversion Navigator, that's the RAIN-420 doppler radar, is a real beauty, I gotta get my hands on that - oh, uh, and we'll save some lives, too."

It's a slow news day, and so a recent study by the Scientific Centre of Analytical Metadata is getting considerable attention. After a decade of expensive travel to exotic climes, researchers have concluded that nations where people laugh more have a lower GDP. Your advisers have gathered to find out what you want to do.

The Debate
1. "That's just a funny coincidence!" yells joke shop owner @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ as she waves a rubber-chicken at you, her cheeks puffed out in anger. "Laughter is a tonic! Laughter is the best medicine! If you take away laughter, you destroy the beating heart of @@NAME@@! Dismiss this crackpot theory and keep the joy that makes @@NAME@@ so great... by subsidising the humour-retail industry!"

2. "At last! The link is proven!" notes clothes factory owner @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ as he spies on his staff through CCTV. "I last smiled seventy-two years ago and it is an accident I have striven not to repeat! Every day, the girls who should be working my machines are just laughing. I keep telling them to keep their heads down, but they keep on giggling and smiling and... oh, they're so disobedient! Someone needs to punish them. Give employers the right to dock wages and force extra hours for excessive joviality. That'll show those minxes!"

3. "Why so glum when there's shopping to be done?" sings devoted consumer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sporting a lovely green velvet jacket. "Just cut sales taxes on luxury goods so everybody can shop their way out of misery! Your government is wasting money funding thinktanks and research groups of dubious value. You should cut the funding of SCAM and other analysts, and give me back my own @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. The resulting spending spree will put a smile on my face AND boost the economy!"

[4]. "This crass commercialism saddens my heart," observes dour faith leader @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, shaking his head sadly. "What about the soul? Laughter is evil spirits, shaking our bodies. Each guffaw is the spirit of the divine, leaking out of the body. It is Written! For the sake of the collective salvation of @@NAME@@, laughter must be banned!" [[color=purple]Must ban Religion[/color] OR [color=purple]Low Religiousness[/color]]

5. "How can you listen to these people?" asks depressed laughter therapist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dabbing away a tear. "@@NAME@@ needs joy, now more than ever.

After a recent initiative to plant vast farms of avocados in the tundra of Northern @@NAME@@ proved to be a massive failure, people have begun questioning the wisdom and competence of the highly influential Organization for Unilaterally Researching Science, Trade, Agriculture, Land, Investments and Nationalization. Functionaries from all levels of the Party have lined up outside your office, demanding action.

The Debate
1. "Decline!" roars Kim, Vanguard of the Proletariat, your sister, and overzealous People's Commissar of Enlightenment. "For years we have seen the former glory of higher education sink into an abyss of depravity, idiocy and inefficiency. We must promptly act, before the stains of nepotism and petit bourgeois decadence seep out of the faculty chamber and corrupt every inch of the Party! Purge the incompetents and install only the truest of experts on the council. I would be willing to lead the campaign to bring the means of production and research closer together, for the sake of the @@TYPE@@, of course."

2. "Please don't listen to auntie; you know what she's like with her demagoguery," sighs Kim, leading agricultural researcher and also your nephew. "I'll grant you that the arctic avocados weren't my best idea, and Nikita's fixation with corn farming didn't pan out. However, I'm sure things will get better eventually, and you shouldn't punish creative solutions and youthful enthusiasm! Leave us be, and send auntie and the rest of the revisionists for a standard session of re-proletarianization at the mining operations."

[3]. "Typical. The nomenklatura are unable to see beyond the existing state of things," says Kim, a high ranking Party official that, in a surprising turn of events, has no family connection to you whatsoever. "To advance to the next Historical stage, we must abolish the counter-revolutionary family ties that cloud our judgments and breed corruption. We'll set up mating programs to ensure a healthy flow of offspring and raise all developing @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ as wards of the state. Sure, it doesn't really solve the avocado dilemma, and it might be a tad expensive and complicated to administer, but I'm sure it'll completely eliminate our corruption problem in the long run.

[b][anchor=524]#524[/anchor]: Something Is Rotten In The State Of @@NAME@@ [Kainesia; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
@@NAME@@ has hardly changed its electoral constituencies since King Maxbari IV ruled ancient Maxtopia. After a politician was recently elected to represent 3 people and @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@, people have begun debating the merits of reforming electoral areas, and eliminating the so-called "rotten" constituencies.

The Debate
1. "Aren't we supposed to be a democracy?" shouts political activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has never voted in an election due to living in a town that was an unincorporated bog the last time electoral borders were drawn. "It's inherently unfair that a tiny burrow of inbred farmers gets as many - or even more - representatives as new and major population centres. The government must redraw the electoral map so each seat is elected by the same number of voters."

2. "Isn't that how we got into this mess in the first place, by drawing up boundaries?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the leader of a well-meaning little liberal party that has consistently failed to gain any representation under the current system. "A better idea would be to put an end to the practice of giving seats to different areas, and instead allocate them based on how many votes the parties get nationally. It might lead to complicated coalitions and a risk for complete failure to agree on anything... but at least it will be fair."

3. "How dare these people say such things about our electoral system?" accuses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, self-styled Knight of the Shire, elected to represent a miniscule cluster of rickety chateaus in western @@NAME@@. "We need these constituencies to elect representatives that understand and guard our traditional values. Without them, the government will consist of people with common charisma, but no brains. We could do with rearranging the number of seats each constituency get, however. Just to make sure we elect enough representatives that have a proper understanding of our social order."

[4]. "The right kind of people, yes, hear hear!" agrees Lord Gerry of The Mander, one of your ever-supportive benefactors and campaign donors. "Tradition is grand, splendid in fact. But, election season is nearing, and wouldn't it be nice with a slightly more favourable demographic composition in the voting districts? I've taken the liberty to do a few calculations, and, well, let's just say that a few pen-strokes goes a long way." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

The Debate
1. "I can't hold it in any longer!" bursts out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, red-faced and desperate. "The need for more free public conveniences in @@NAME@@ is painfully obvious. We demand the government roll out a program of construction lest the lack of them causes a stain on our good nation."

2. "Yes there is a need for more public facilities, but that is such a bog standard solution and would generate so much paperwork," says Luigi Loo, head of @@NAME@@'s largest plumbing contractor, Go With The Flow. "Take the plunge with us and we'll give @@NAME@@ the fanciest conveniences in @@REGION@@. I admit this might require customers to spend a penny or two, but they'll feel flushed with success when they see what they get in return."

3. "I have another solution!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spokesbeing of eccentric primitivist group Nature's Call as they take a stool by your desk. "I suggest you wash your hands of the matter by closing what facilities there are, and allow citizens to get back to basics by making it legal for any of us to use the nearest bush." A twig that you hadn't previously noticed falls from their hair.

The Issue
Residents of an isolated countryside community were powerless to do anything when two armed robbers picked clean the village's three shops in broad daylight. It took the police two hours to arrive on the scene, provoking hysterical outrage over the lack of police presence in outlying rural settlements.

The Debate
1. "I can't sleep at night any more!" sobs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the victims of the crime. "Those criminals could strike back at our peaceful haven at any time! When I was a sprog, we had these local village constables that patrolled the town and had the power to deal with local problems as they saw fit, be it by hanging, whipping or summary execution. Sure, whining liberals said that they were abusing their power, but we need them back! Making the police answer to central bureaucracy was a terrible mistake!"

2. "No, dearie, you're not thinking big enough!" complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, local tractor dealership owner. "An ambulance from our nearest hospital takes an hour just to get here! Refuse collectors turn up once a month! It takes my suppliers several days just to deliver materials we need along our rutted country lanes. I mean, what sort of weird vehicle is meant to be able to handle awful terrain like this? We need asphalt roads and steel rails! Build transport connections to every corner of the country!"

[3]. "What is this, the dark ages?" asks teenage video game fan @@RANDOM_NAME@@, not even looking up from the latest FPS. "Police cars are never going to be fast enough to get to a crime, no matter how good your roads are. You need fast response hubs with enforcement helicopters, rapid insertion airplanes and police paratroopers, all linked to state of the art satellite surveillance technology. Bad guy in the outback?

"It's obvious that these drones cause nothing but trouble. Just require that any man-made objects flying overhead have a pilot.

5. "Obviously we can't just let anyone run around with these things - that would be ludicrous!" sputters the Chief of Police of Cape @@NAME@@. "However, these drones could certainly help my department find fugitives, carry out investigations, y'know, that sort of thing.

[b][anchor=529]#529[/anchor]: Attack Of The Attack Ads [Czechostan; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
As an increasingly tense election season looms, candidates have already begun smearing their opponents with vulgar and offensive campaign advertisements. Politicians and pundits of all corners of the political spectrum have asked you to bring some civility back to politics.

The Debate
1. "Whatever happened to the good old days?" cries MP @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who saw an ebb of support along with a slew of negative ads targeting his large nose. "Politicians used to be elected based on merit, but now the election process has turned into such a sham! One single ad-hominem attack is all it takes to tarnish an honorable politician's career. Not to be nosy, but the government should step in and prevent the media from advertising attack ads and political campaigns from producing them. I can hear the complaints now: 'blah blah free speech, blah blah censorship', but if that's the price to pay to restore honour to politics, then so be it."

2. "If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen," vents political strategist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was the mastermind behind your most recent election victory. "Perhaps the reason the MP lost support was not because of negative campaigning, but rather poor policies and performance. Attack adverts are as old as politics itself and are no more rampant or influential today than than they've ever been - leave them be.

After a newscaster insulted the Crown Prince live on TV, saying that His Royal Highness was both fat and ugly, furious monarchists have demanded that lèse majesté laws prosecute the newscaster for defaming the Royal Family.

The Debate

Their fancy titles and tiaras shouldn't protect them from criticism, because our leading political figures need to know what the people really think about them.

The Issue
An anonymous whistle-blower has released thousands of documents detailing how law firms in the tiny tropical island nation of Manamana helped politicians and businesspeople from @@NAME@@ hide millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in undeclared income. The scandal, dubbed the "Manamana Memos" by the media, has rocked @@NAME@@, as it involves several famous figures, including world leaders and public officials linked to your government.

The Debate
1. "This is clearly a law enforcement issue," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the Financial Crimes division. "This is a reflection of the state of neglect my division finds itself in. We need more manpower, state of the art computer systems, new vehicles, maybe some snappy new uniforms, and of course, new legislation that gives us broader powers to investigate financial crimes, including the subpoenaing and wiretapping of suspects. Give us the resources we need and I'll have those fat cats paying their taxes in no time."

2. "Oh my Violet! What is this communist madness?" screams Alistair Sid, the blue-haired and googly-eyed senior-partner at one of the implicated law firms. "My clients are furious! What kind of country is this when you can't even have assets abroad without the press snooping on them?" He pauses to tear up a packet of chocolate chips, devouring all of them voraciously before continuing his tirade. "Me want you to make this go away, @@LEADER@@. Journalists should have no right to publish private financial data of politicians and corporations; it's a breach of privacy and public trust! Prosecute all the journalists and so-called whistle-blowers responsible for this! Oh Violet, it looks like I picked the wrong week to quit dropping spunkmeyers, om nom nom nom."

3. "The problem is capitalism," argues social activist and @@NAME@@'s oldest politician 'Colonel' Ernie Flanders. "We wouldn't be in this mess if tax havens weren't allowed in the first place. It is outrageous! Multinational corporations and the top one percent can suck the wealth from our country dry and then take it offshore to some so-called financial paradise to avoid paying taxes. We need capital controls to prevent economic collapse so we don't end up in an economic mess like Bigtopia. We need to wage war against this corrupt system! Outlaw this practice at once!"

4. "The problem is government and @@LEADER@@'s incompetence," counters noted billionaire Edward Rump, who was coincidentally listed in the Manamana Memos. "People come up to me all the time and tell me that they take their money abroad because they are tired of dealing with the draconian tax code and endless bureaucracy in this country.

The Issue
In a recent high profile trial in @@CAPITAL@@, notorious mobster Maxine 'The Octopus' Barryotti was accused of murder, racketeering, grand theft, and jaywalking. The trial ended in acquittal on all counts after several witnesses - who had given detailed and damning out-of-court statements to police - failed to come to court. The prosecutor's office has now come to you demanding that @@NAME@@ review its laws regarding the use of out-of-court statements.

The Debate
1. "What a miscarriage of justice!" shouts disgruntled district attorney Haley Dent, as she flings a huge stack of police reports on your desk. "Look at all of these great statements made by a dozen witnesses, but now that jerk Maxine goes free just because they didn't personally show up. You know how hard it is to wrangle up a dozen witnesses for trial? Like herding bats! That trial should have ended in a guilty verdict after five minutes, but the way things are it's a coin-flip whether justice is done or not. If a witness makes a report to a cop, that cop should be able to testify to what was said."

2. "You can't be serious!" cries family attorney Tam Hagen, who defended Barryotti. "Don't you realize we have this rule against out-of-court statements for a reason? A person can only have a fair trial if they get to confront their accuser face to face in open court. Sometimes the reason witnesses don't show up to trial is that they know they were lying to police all along! Allowing in all of these out-of-court statements will mean more innocent people get convicted. Sure, sometimes a guilty person will go free... ahem, not my client of course, but some actually guilty person. But isn't it better a thousand guilty people go free than to wrongfully convict even a single person?"

3. "All of this is too complicated," interrupts Mark Commodus, an imperious-seeming minister, "and this right here is why people are so darn sick of all these courts and legal shenanigans. Seems like any way you slice it, dumb rules get in the way of justice. I propose a third way: bring back trial by ordeal! Let the accused wrestle with an @@ANIMAL@@, and if they win they didn't do it and get to go free. If they lose, we lock up or bury whatever remains. It's a foolproof system that our ancestors used for a thousand years, and I'll tell ya, they didn't waste a pretty penny on it!"

The Issue
Following the most recent election, it has come to your attention that some politicians ran unopposed. Some ridings still remain without a representative due to an incredible lack of interest. As apathy rises, you have been called to fix what many are calling a "broken system".

The Debate
1. "I'm disappointed that people don't participate in government," sighs high school civics teacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while trying to squeeze past your bodyguards. "We can't practice democracy if we don't have a choice to make! Here's my solution: elected positions should not be filled until there are multiple candidates. Why not funnel some funding towards encouraging people to stand for election? You could pay people a stipend for taking the time out to run for office, and have a pot of money to pay campaigning expenses of those too poor to fund themselves."

2. A retinue of burly guards clear out all the citizens from your office as the boisterous mayor of @@CAPITAL@@ walks in. "The fact that I have won the last five elections because I was the only candidate means nothing. Actually, it means that the people love me too much to challenge me because I'm the best dang mayor this city's ever had! Don't fix the system, @@LEADER@@, because the system ain't broken. It ought to be left in the hands of people like ourselves who know how to get things done."

3. "Nobody wants to run for office because nobody wants to be in the government," replies your mother as she tries to make dinner plans with you. "Think about it. When was the last time someone who actually presented a challenge ran against you? When I was raising you and your siblings, I'd settle who got to play with the toys by drawing straws, and I think we can use the same approach. People from all over @@NAME@@ could be chosen at random to fill a government office for a fixed term. As an added bonus, it would root out the corrupt career politicians and opportunists, since they couldn't run for office anymore. Sure, these new people aren't as qualified, but fair's fair, right?"

4. "Look at this cat video!" exclaims your easily distracted brother while showing you a video of a kitten being potty trained. "The thing is, @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are too dumb to figure out the issues, let alone the right candidate. Do you really think the average Joe cares about the ongoing oil crisis in Maxtopia or increasing tensions with East Lebatuck? All they care about is making sure they have a slice of pizza while watching their shows. Wouldn't it be easier if you picked the candidates for your Party and screened out the undesirables? The Opposition can of course implement similar rules for their parties. Oh, look, a squirrel!" Your brother runs outside your office and begins to chase a squirrel around a tree.

5. "Ha ha! The kitty thinks it's people!" squees your rather shallow niece after picking up her father's phone. "Isn't it cute? Way cuter than any of those ugly politicians I was supposed to support last election. It would be so much easier for me if I didn't have to worry about voting. With all that time I would save, I could start a vlog!"

The Issue
Productivity numbers in @@NAME@@ are plummeting, while employees are found slacking off on the job playing online games. A game called NationStates is especially blamed for the loss of an enormous amount of man-hours per day.

The Debate
1. "This game is an outrage!" says pointy-haired IT-manager Daniel Olaf Santos, who was recently permabanned from the site for repeated trolling and excessive picspam of phallic images. "Too many people waste their time playing silly simulation games and discussing LOLcats and transgenderism when they should be spending their time productively. Our economy cannot afford this nonsense; let us get rid of those online games, NationStates in particular!" 

2. "Oh, no... oh, no... You can't take away my NationStates! I've got to have my NationStates!" pleads @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prominent figure within the site's Conquer/Reclaim sub-culture. "Uhhh... I mean, uhhh... playing a game is just harmless fun, really, and it works great to reduce stress or helps one to get through a boring day at the office. What we need to do is improve the financial conditions for the people running the site, so they can give us even more features! That'll make all of us happier, and there's nothing better for productivity than a cheerful workforce, right?" 

3. "I'll have you know that NationStates can be used for all sorts of productive purposes," insists @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who looks suspiciously similar to site owner and operator Max Barry, apart from the fake moustache. "It can be a useful educational tool if integrated in school classes on politics and civics, for example.

1. "Well, someone had to do it!" yelps self-appointed head of one of the border towns' lynch mobs, Edward Salem. "That lady was commitin' witcheries left and right, turned my nephew into a newt she did! I mean... he got better, but that's besides the point! The gov'ment needs to let us protect ourselves and rid our peace lovin' towns of these foul she-devils!"

2. "No no, that won't work," says a tall, dark-haired mysterious stranger walking into your office with a gust of wind stirring his long duster coat and hat. He throws a crossbow onto your desk before continuing, "These simple folk do not have the honed skills to hunt witches or any other devil of the night for that matter. But I am a monster hunter. If you set up a sanctioned guild, then we can properly hunt these necromancers."

3. "We'd appreciate it if you would all kindly mind your own business," chastises Hermione Potter, who is dressed in a long black robe and pointed hat. "Our traditions are centuries old, and it is about time the government stepped in and protected us. You'd do well to build us a proper school away from these barbar – oh honestly Ronald, give me that," she takes a carved wand from a young red-headed boy, "it's Lo-go-phil-ia Levi-o-sa, make the 'phil' nice and long."

4. "Where shall I begin?" coolly starts the head of the local planetarium, Dr. Carl deLawne Dyson. "These people, these simple farmers, they are taking what they don't understand and they are calling it witchery. This sort of unsubstantiated ignorance must be stamped out. There is no such thing as witches, plain and simple. We need to start working towards a future free from these backwards superstitions at whatever cost."

[b][anchor=537]#537[/anchor]: Summary Injustice [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
An anti-corruption case accusing a Constitutional Court Judge of abusing his power was recently dismissed without trial, because the same Constitutional Court Judge said that he was 'too tired to read the case notes'. After a week of bad press, the national ombudsman is demanding that you review the case personally, as it has become a cause célèbre within the legal community.

The Debate
1. "The system in place is a mockery of justice, beholden to the whims and corruptibility of individual judges," lectures Ombudsman @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is once again concerned with the plight of the common man. "The little guy doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell when one biased judge gets to decide everything! We simply must bring back trial by jury for all criminal cases, or else our legal system will be considered as hopelessly corrupt as Maxtopia's."

2. "Why would we ever trust legal judgment to the untrained and unwashed masses?" asks Justice @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ over tea and scones in his tower-shaped house, which appears to be made of ivory. "Only the legal elite are sufficiently educated to decide cases properly, especially on such complicated matters as criminal law. Uphold the decision of the Constitutional Court, and let me also sentence those annoying agitators for wasting the court's precious time with this nonsense."

3. "I'll admit it: unilateral judgement is a flawed system," observes Clotho Cerberus, one of the three Cerberus sisters, who is promptly interrupted by her sibling Lachesis Cerberus. "But I also acknowledge my sister's point that citizen juries lack the legal knowledge to make sound judgments." Atropos Cerberus then interrupts the other two siblings, "So why not have all courts run by a triumvirate of judges, with a two-to-one majority needed to impose sentences? That way, no one bad seed can corrupt the entire judiciary."

Tragedy struck last Friday when police had to be called to a pop concert when the queue for the women's washroom devolved first into squabbles, then a violent free-for-all, as desperate female fans fought to get to the front.

The Debate
1. "Women being forced to wait is... is... just another form of sexism," complains @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a cross-legged concert-goer, with strained emphasis. "By forcing businesses and old stadiums to accommodate more… more… ah, people in women's washrooms, we can finally realise a fairer, more equal experience at the wash- SPEED IT UP, GRANS, SOME OF US HAVE GOT TO GO!"

2. "What a load of sh-" starts @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a controversial heavy metal singer, before being interrupted by the concert-goer elbowing her way past him with a desperate look on her face. "Look, if they don't like having to wait for the loo they can always bring their 'business' elsewhere. It's a free market. Nobody is forcing them folks to go there. One washroom for each gender.

Robotics giant Robot4U Inc. has caused an uproar in @@NAME@@ for its new product – Mindy The Android Wife. Budding 'android rights' activists and feminist groups have demanded the sale of such units be outlawed.

The Debate
1. "This revolting product sets gender equality back a century!" says noted feminist writer @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ as she signs copies of her latest book, Still Wild at 40. "It reflects a male obsession with having women slaving as housewives. Mindy is a docile patriarchal archetype that cooks, cleans, irons and has no true free will. This modern day misogynistic slavery is disgusting! The sale of Mindy units should be outlawed at once, and whatever units already sold should be seized, deactivated and thrown in a ditch somewhere!"

2. "Has anyone actually asked Mindy?" asks Brent Noonian Soong, CEO of Robot4U Inc, with several different Mindy models by his side. "I doubt any of these complainers and naggers have actually bothered to talk to her. Mindy is a realistic android that feels, learns, and knows how to have fun. Ask her yourself and Mindy will tell you how happy she is, won't you Mindy? We'll even give you one so you can show all of @@NAME@@ how dedicated Mindy is. Oh, and can you make android marriage legal? You'll never need to argue with your wife again. Mindy even comes with an off switch!"

3. "Unlike the misogynists over at Robot4U, we manufacture both androids and gynoids in all sexual orientations," replies @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, CEO of rival high-tech manufacturer CyberMirage Labs, seen holding hands with a male android. "Thanks to my fully functional boyfriend, Mark, every day I'm aware how hard things are for robots. Our androids won't be sold as slaves.

We did all the hard work ourselves." He launches into a tirade of anecdotes and war stories, pausing only to feed some pigeons. Eventually, as you are about to leave, he gets to the point. "Anyways, if you want to be strong and sharp like my generation you young'uns need to eat your spinach and ban all those machines and technologies that are making you fat, lazy, and completely dependent!"

After one of your recent speeches included an accidental spoiler for the bestselling novel Hexicon, angry librarians, teenagers, and fantasy aficionados have completely surrounded your office in protest. After a hard day's work, you have agreed to meet with the protesters, if only so that you can get out of the building.

The Debate
1. "Speeches, not spoilers!" chants your teenage niece, who has been leading the protest. "Look, I'm trying to be a good citizen here, paying attention to what's going on around me, but if you're going to spoil something that I haven't even had chance to read, then I'm not going to bother! If you really need to talk about stuff that isn't politics in your speeches, at least warn us about it! Sure, it might look a bit silly, but who cares? This is almost as bad as when I was told that Planet of the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ was @@REGION@@ all along!"

2. "Can't these people get a life?" asks your visibly tired speechwriter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has been shredding hate mail all day. "Simply say something appeasing, then carry on your business as you normally would. Honestly, I wish I had the free time to read; then I'd finally find out why everyone keeps getting so upset about this Dumbledore business. Besides, wouldn't referencing pop culture make you 'cool' and 'with it', as the kids are saying these days?"

3. "Who cares what 'rosebud' meant, or who was the real Caesar So-say? There's more to life than fiction," observes your always serious Finance Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is known around the office as a total buzzkill. "What's important here is that you've given a lot, and I mean a lot of publicity to that hack of an author, and he hasn't paid us a single cent! Maybe if people are going to care so much about what you talk about in those speeches of yours, we should be getting companies to pay for the privilege of being mentioned. Sure, some may call it 'bribery' and 'unethical', but there's no such thing as free advertising."

4. "Spoilers must be banned!" wails George JK Token, the beloved and bearded fantasy author of Hexicon and the popular A Play of Crowns series. "It's of no coincidence that mere days after you spoiled my book, it fell from its number one position on the @@CAPITAL@@ Times best seller list.

The Issue
This past week the legislature shot down a flagship law, setting back your whole agenda at least a year. Considering your party had a comfortable majority and should easily have passed the bill, your inner circle has been considering what kind of discipline to impose on parliamentary rebels.

The Debate
1. "I'm telling you, police those fools!" shouts an angry @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the legislator who co-authored the proposed law with you. "No, I mean literally! Have the building security officers march around in full riot gear, looking every MP right in the eye! I dare any of my lily-livered colleagues to defy our will THEN! A strong and unified party means a strong and unified @@NAME@@, whatever those opposition goons may blather."

2. Loyalist legislator Francis Woodheart has other ideas on what to do with the rebels. "We really don't need anything quite so drastic, my friend. We can police ourselves! Just appoint me as 'whip,' and then I can use the power of persuasion on any party members who won't fall in line. Don't like the government's budget proposal? That's a shame, I really wanted to drop your name in @@LEADER@@'s ear for that open cabinet post..."

3. "Members of our legislature have ALWAYS voted according to their conscience," bellows @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the dissenters. "That bill would have destroyed our way of life in Northwest @@NAME@@, and we won't allow that to happen! You snooty @@CAPITAL@@ scalawags keep flogging the same old dead horses, trying to bulldoze our culture, and we're plum sick of it. There've gotta be more safeguards against partisan and sectional tyranny. We need to have local control of local issues, and institute a secret ballot in the legislature. Only then are we safe from the storm of wrath and repercussions - from you, from the donors, or from the voters."

4. "Uh, speaking of voters..." mutters Sandy Berman, the Minister of Domestic Affairs. "Remember them? You're all so focused on getting your own agendas passed that you've forgotten why we're here in the first place! The voters didn't send us here to squabble like screaming children about who didn't support someone's National Moose Empowerment Act! They want us to get things done, and they'll bring home anyone who's not pulling their weight. Recall elections will make those rebels the local whipping boys. Forget secret ballots, we need to SPREAD the word who voted for what - the electorate will send us the right people if we just give them a chance."

5. "This word 'whip' has me thinking," ponders your old friend and chief-of-staff @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Brutus, who is also the odds-on favorite to replace you one day. "What if we let everyone vote as usual, but every time some upstart so-called 'statesman' votes against your wishes, you ACTUALLY get to whip them! Live, in the public square! Wouldn't that be a delicious spectacle? The sting of the lash, the sound of leather striking flesh... I can't imagine anyone wanting to lead @@NAME@@ without it."

Nuclear energy, the source of much of your growing nation's electricity, has been generating radioactive waste as a by-product. As the shadows cast by the mounting piles of warning-emblazoned concrete casks grow ever longer, a concerned populace is looking to you for a more permanent solution.

The Debate
1. "There's a boring and sensible approach," suggests corduroy-clad grey-haired engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, rolling out a blueprint in front of you and ignoring the yawns of those attending the presentation. "Deep geologic disposal. My team has determined several sites for the construction of an extremely deep shaft underground to dispose of the nuclear waste. It's relatively inexpensive, we can mostly guarantee that the waste will never reach the surface, and it will be far safer than our current storage system. Exciting stuff, eh?"

2. "Let me tell you a story," says Stanley Leigh, the local representative of protest group Citizens Rejecting Atomic Power. "One day, some bad companies mix up this toxic cocktail that can poison people for thousands or millions of years. Then, they bury it, and think nothing more of it. Then, some kid in ten thousand years winds up a one-eyed mutant cyclops, and has no clue why. Turn off the reactors, buddy, and find a better way. Sure it's hard, but people like us have to make hard decisions."

3. "Once again, Science has the answer!" proclaims physics professor @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, striking her best heroic pose and pointing symbolically to the distant horizon. "Vitrification! Ion exchange! Synroc! We can separate out the components of the waste, burn off the long-lived stuff in fast reactors, reallocate the plutonium to weapons manufacture, and leave only short-lived waste that lasts merely hundreds of years. This will mean that we will not run out of fuel, and the environment will be spared from contamination. Increased industrial expenses? Yes. Necessary security costs and extensive safety regulations? Yes, sure, whatever. But, awesome Super Science? Triple yes, yes, yes!"

[4]. "I feel ashamed to be offering you an even better and easier solution, one that won't cost you a thing and might even make you a little money," simpers Snidely Industries CEO Cornelius Davidson Snidely while twirling his handlebar moustache. "Why, this waste could be sold to some very special international clients who would be very discreet about where they bought it from.

Many of those impacted are demanding you take action.

The Debate
1. "They can't keep getting away with this," states Chief of Police @@RANDOM_NAME@@ calmly, eyes fixed on a slow motion playback of the incident's CCTV footage. "This snot nosed little punk wasted an entire day's worth of police time with unnecessary evacuations and dealing with panicking crowds.

2. "I thought it was pretty funny," says Barry Yalen, an itchy-looking teenager scratching at his crotch. "All he said was that it might be droll if a couple of thousand people all showed up to the mall on Tuesday the 18th at 11:32 am and did the Lice Bucket Challenge. He never TOLD anyone to do it. Just that, you know, it'd be funny if people did! You can't start getting mad at people for saying something would be cool. Don't step on our freedoms, man!"

3. "We shouldn't infringe freedom of speech, but we need to do something," grumbles janitor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wielding a pest-spray and mop. "As far as I'm concerned, it's the kids who empty out buckets of bugs who need to be punished. If I told them to jump in front of a bus, would they do it? Personal responsibility is what I'm talking about - have the system sentence all two thousand of these idiots, and put them to community service making the nation a better place."

4. "You know the real problem is how fast Flashy_G was able to spread chaos," observes your Minister of Memetic Warfare, carefully replacing the ink cartridge in her fountain pen. "These little online social media apps can reach hundreds of thousands of people in seconds. That's faster than the police can act or we can counter it. This could escalate from pesky teens spreading pests, to actual mobs destroying our government. On the other hand, if we can control the flow of information, then we can control the country. My people can secretly take control of the social media sites and track down this troublemaker and any others who emerge. Then, rather than silence them, we can adjust their activities to suit our needs."

The Issue
Triple-A videogame title "Panty Theft Auto" has caused a stir amongst feminists and concerned parents, with many demanding government action against objectification and sexualization of women in the game industry.

The Debate
1. "This is disgusting!" cries Alice N. Beck-Dell, a proudly feminist media commentator. "Look at these bimbos in all of these games! They'd need back braces to stand up if they were real! The male protagonist can rack up passive female conquests, and even gets a set of pornographic virtual trading cards for each one he collects. Can't we apply some modern day standards to this growing industry, to limit the objectification? Drooling teenage boys might admittedly be a significant market, but there are adult and women gamers too! Isn't some censorship worth it, for a less misogynistic society?"

2. "You can't be serious," complains Stan Houser, creative director of the game, covertly slipping you some special edition artwork of a chain-mail bikini elf-knight in a brown paper bag. "I like pretty girls. My customers like pretty girls. Pretty girls sell games. It isn't the job of the gaming industry to spread a social message and if these moral crusaders don't like it, they don't have to buy the game. Don't restrict the free market, or freedom of expression."

3. "Whatever Panty Theft Auto is doing is what we real men want!" squeaks nerdy 13-year old @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, stroking his caterpillar-like moustache as he sneaks the chainmail-elf picture into his own pocket. "If anything, we should apply this principle to every piece of media we make and import! Instead of making a censor board, you should have an UNcensor board! Give every female huge pair... uh... personality! Add CGI cut-scenes where we can give these ladies what they need! Hell, make sure ALL media is as sexy as hell! Not only it would benefit us men, it would benefit the economy too!"

4. "The problem here isn't some video games, it's ALL video games," observes disbarred attorney Tom Jackson, peering at you over a stack of lawsuit documents. "Video games keep kids - and adults for that matter - on the couch all day. They rot brains, cause moral decay and encourage violence. I'm not blaming kids here, I'm blaming the media we feed them: don't hate the players, hate the game! Ban this trash, and get kids back outdoors playing healthy and wholesome games like mumbletypeg or pinfinger!"

The Debate
1. "We should damn well get a vote!" splutters @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, the expat at the heart of the furore, over the phone from his Brancalandian retirement resort. "We are born and bred citizens of @@NAME@@ and we are entitled to the same basic rights as everyone else, including the right to suffrage. You fascists can't deny us that!

Freegans - people who eat food, wear clothes, and use other goods retrieved from trash bins - have created a big stink across @@NAME@@. They've especially gotten up the noses of retail business owners, who say the practice pongs. The disputants have dumped themselves in your office, insisting you dispose of the issue.

The Debate
1. "Freeganism promotes environmental responsibility by reducing consumption," says Gaia @@ANIMAL@@ Rainbow, while rifling through your waste basket and pocketing a piece of used gum. "Our consumerist economy wastes an obscene amount of natural resources by throwing away perfectly good and usable items! In fact, most food that reaches it's 'sell by' date is still perfectly safe to eat. Greedy corporate interests are slapping the faces of the poor, the wretched and the needy when you consider how much they waste. The government needs to support freegans, and help us trash waste!"

2. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, President of the @@CAPITAL@@ Chamber of Commerce, passes around free embossed air fresheners before interjecting. "That smelly anarchist fails to mention the huge mess created by everyone digging around in our dumpsters, which scares away our customers! Eating expired food out of the trash is dangerously unhealthy, not to mention totally gross. Look, the bottom line is we're losing business because of these vultures. Can you get the police to arrest them? If they want food and clothing, they should have to work hard to buy them like any other @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@."

3. "YO! DOWN HERE!" bellows a voice through your office window. You look down at the street to see @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a municipal garbage collector. "Look, it ain't safe to have people diggin' through dumpsters. But hey, I get it. It ain't right to have good food thrown away when so many are hungry. YO SAL!" The worker whacks the side of the truck a couple of times, and the compactor inside begins to roar. "Why don't you boost welfare spendin', and require shops to donate past-'sell-by'... wha?... um, but safe goods to food banks? Make 'em an offer they can't scrap."

The Issue
A shocking exposé on tourist attraction OceanWorld has revealed the mistreatment of captive orcas and other marine animals. Your office has since faced a tidal wave of complaints demanding government action.

The Debate
1. "This is torture!" shouts renowned whale biologist Willy Free, seen wearing an orca costume. "These poor and mistreated creatures can't experience their natural habitat, and frankly live solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short lives! They can handle living in the wilderness and thrive better there. We must end these inhumane captivity programs. The same can go for zoos, circuses, and aquariums, too."

*2. "You can't do that, you ignorant whale lovers!" pleads CEO of OceanWorld, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while counting OceanWorld @@CAPITAL@@'s daily intake. "If you ban institutions like OceanWorld, how are endangered species going to survive in this big bad world? Isn't it better that their populations thrive in our viewing tanks, rather than struggling in prime fishing waters?

4. "Perhaps there could be a compromise?" queries your Minister of Environment, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has been smelling like grass lately. "Ending zoos would harm the tourism industry, and we can't deny that these programs help endangered species. Why don't we set a limit on what animals they take? Specifically the endangered ones? I'm sure that we can also force tougher standards to ensure OceanWorld treats the animals humanely as well."

[b][anchor=548]#548[/anchor]: Appointment Of A Science Advisor [Golgothastan; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
After the government's chief science advisor accidentally disintegrated himself in his latest experiment, you have come under pressure to appoint someone new to the position - but the leading candidates to replace him all have different priorities.

The Debate
1. "Science is critical to understanding our place in the natural world," writes biologist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ in his application letter, which is covered in paw-prints and smells faintly of @@ANIMAL@@ dung. "I believe we need to look more closely at how our actions affect the environment, and if I'm appointed as advisor, I'll make sure the government takes the long term view to ecological preservation - even if that does mean putting a few public works projects and industry partnerships on hold."

[2]. "Now now, you're not going to listen to all that tree-hugging nonsense, are you?" cajoles chemist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, introduced to you at a cocktail party thrown by one of your biggest corporate donors. "The government needs to be partnering up with industry, not making things harder for them. If I'm appointed, I'll make sure the government promotes innovation and invention - and if that means loosening up some of those silly environmental laws, then so be it!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3. "Typical: a new vacancy for a government science advisor opens up, and it immediately becomes a boys' club," sighs physicist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, sporting a rather fetching pink lab coat. "Do you realize that girls outperform boys in science at every grade in school, but that far fewer women end up taking jobs in the sciences than men? Appointing a woman as the nation's science advisor would be a great first step to improving access to the sciences for everyone - and I'd use the position to lobby for universities and research centres to hire more women, too."

4. "Whomever you appoint will just end up leading @@NAME@@ into further damnation!" rants fundamentalist preacher @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ in one of her sermons, replete with typically alarming - and anatomically explicit - descriptions of what this damnation will actually entail. "It's time we purged the government of all its heathen influences, and that includes removing anyone who might go around using words like evolution, or entropy, or evidence!" She breaks off to chase after a group of scientists passing by, waving a pitchfork at them.

The Issue
After a month spent surveying the country and asking adolescents to bend over and touch their toes, researchers from the Healthy Eating Analytical Research Think Tank limped home to nurse some black eyes and calculate their figures. They found that @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ teenagers are among the fattest in the world. Now, as you sit down to a sumptuous seven-course meal and a decent Marche Noirian red, your guests are all keen to opine on the topic.

The Debate
1. "You know what you should do?" says your nephew, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, cramming a slice of peacock-stuffed-ostrich into his mouth. "You should have a big annual games, just like the Ancient Maxtopians did, where gladiators fight to the death with spears. Except this time, the fatties get thrown into the arena. The winners would receive hundreds of thousands of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@," he jumps in his seat excitedly, "A- And t-the losers," a little peacock flies out of his mouth, "would perish like the wimps they are. I bet you anything people will flock to @@CAPITAL@@ to see jumbo mortal combat!"

2. "Why have teens fight with sticks when you can offer them carrots instead?" asks @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the catering assistant who always wanted to be a chef, while wheeling in a cake tray. "Just replace all those nasty sugars and fats with healthy alternatives." She places a meringue beneath your nose, smiling with pleasure as you take a bite, "You'd never guess that meringue's made with stevia, agar gel and chickpea aquafaba egg substitute!" She beams, as you spit the chemical concoction discretely into a napkin, "Just force manufacturers to take all those nasty ingredients out of our food, and our young people will be fitter in no time."

[3]. "Yea, verily we are a nation of gluttons, forgive us," pontificates the Archbishop of @@CAPITAL@@, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, before cracking open his sixth lobster-claw. "If we are to be absolved, we must fast. Make it compulsory that every @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@, children included, fast for forty days every year in accordance with our religious principles... except those of advanced spiritual enlightenment, like us," he adds, out of the corner of his mouth, "That'll trim waistlines and straighten out a few souls too." [Validity: ???]

4. "How 'bout this for an idea?" blurts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, author of popular self-help manual 'Big, Brainy and Beautiful'. "Just butt out. Big is who I am, and big is beautiful. Stop trying to legislate our teens' behinds, and instead promote plus-size beauty for the betterment of our national self-esteem. A little butter never hurt no one; that's what I've always said!"

The Issue
A disturbing new fad has arisen on social media and clickbait sites, featuring linking videos of people suffering violence at the hand of criminals. Muggings, murders, and gang violence are all trending like crazy, and the nation's youthful populace seems to be addicted to online schadenfreude.

The Debate
1. "REPOST THIS TO SHOW YOU CARE!!!" posts popular blogger @@RANDOM_NAME@@, grinning inappropriately while watching a video of a rather savage beating. "Hey, there's nothing wrong with showing the world as it is, especially if it increases the hits on my website. How am I supposed to persuade advertisers to sponsor me unless I have the freedom to publish the most shocking content?"

*2. "There's a moral sickness to this nation!" proclaims frocked pastor @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, seen smiling as he flagellates a penitent fellow clergyman with a rubber whip. "We can only remedy this by proper schooling, with properly funded religious authority imprinting a sense of right and wrong from an early age. When we have young people who are more interested in acting right rather than watching wrong, @@NAME@@ will be a better place." [[color=purple]Must have high religiousness stat[/color]]

*3. "There's a moral sickness to this nation!" proclaims Sange Merkel, who seems to be dressed suspiciously like a priest.

Embrace the guiding hand of God, and when we have young people who are more interested in acting right rather than watching wrong, @@NAME@@ will be a better place." [[color=purple]Must have low religiousness stat[/color] OR [color=blue]Must have atheism[/color]]

4. "Gahh! I can't even tell what's real and isn't real anymore!" moans your social media handler @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while fighting a losing battle against pop-ups and clickbait sites. "Whatever happened to the good old days of internet journalism, back when they weren't littered with ads... and when ads themselves weren't disguised as news? This sort of practice ought to be banned! The internet needs to return to a place of intellectual discussion and education, not this cesspool of clickbait, gross-out violence, and trolling."

5. "Social media made this problem; let social media fix it," suggests too-reasonable seeming taxi driver @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who considers himself an expert on how @@NAME@@ is run after driving around several politicians. "Tell the big companies behind these sites that they have to police their own sites and enforce better standards, or face financial penalties. They've got huge profit margins, and they pay barely any tax, so let them shoulder the cost of the problems they've created."

The Issue
During the preparations of your niece's wedding, you publicly announced the government would be paying for the massive and public event, as fulfillment of a promise made to her when she was six years old. A bucketful of economists, a gaggle of giggling advisers, a susurration of confused affiliates, and an infestation of wedding planners are presently debating this matter of 'national importance'... and are forcing you to join in.

The Debate
1. "You promised!" screeches your visibly upset niece who has turned into a bridezilla. "I deserve a proper marriage! By proper, I mean all princess-like and suitable for someone of such affluence! So what if the money for that comes from the treasury? It is a TREASURE-y right? That money should be spent on important occasions, like this one! It's not like I'm going to have another wedding, unless, you know. Besides, you're @@NAME@@'s leader. Family occasions matter!"

[2]. "Why not let us do all the work?" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@NAME@@'s top wedding planner and chief editor of Bonjour Magazine. "We'll do everything necessary for the wedding, cakes, wedding gowns, the flowers, you name it! Sponsoring your niece's wedding will be the greatest endorsement we could ask for. All you need to do is broadcast the wedding all over @@REGION@@. The profits will be through the roof! It's a win-win!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3. "This looks like an excellent diplomatic opportunity, @@LEADER@@," muses obnoxious Maxtopian diplomat @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who has been stuffing his face with hors d'oeuvre all day. "The leaders of Maxtopia and Blackacre would love the chance for some civil and peaceful discussion. We're talking about major conflict resolutions and a few trade agreements. This could all be done with a couple simple arranged marriages, as we noticed you have other nieces and nephews at the right age. They may not like marrying into our royalty, but don't you want to be remembered as the leader who helped bring about global peace and stability?"

4. "Nobody asked me whether I wanna pay for this!" exclaims disgruntled baker, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is using a piping bag to write anti-government messages on the cake. "The answer is: I don't! I pay taxes for important things like police, education, and fixing potholes. If you want a wedding, spend your own damn money. Oh wait, I forgot, the people pay your salary. So quit wastin' our money on this load of hokey and spend it where it really matters. I think it's time we people know where we're putting our labor, and who's gettin' what in return!"

At last night's press conference in @@CAPITAL@@ you were mooned by three drunk young men. Security has caught them, and they are claiming that this was a 'political protest' against 'government and stuff'. Rather than just throw them in a cell to sleep it off, they're asking if you would like them to deal with the matter in any particular way.

The Debate
*1. "These people should be locked up!" snarls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an angry ex-soldier turned criminal prosecutor. "The fact that they believe that this is acceptable behaviour shows a complete lack of respect of authority! They like showing their butts? Stick them in prison, but issue them no trousers!"

*2. "These people should be locked up!" snarls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an angry ex-soldier turned criminal prosecutor.

"We were mooning the government, not you! This is democracy, man! You gotta give us freedom of... freedom of... whatever this is." The police restrain him as he goes to pull his pants down again.

4. "Okay, boss, here's what you're gonna do!" asserts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of @@NAME@@'s foremost TV pranksters, wearing a mock military uniform, and leaving security to wonder to how your office was penetrated. "You're gonna get the police to find where these people live. Then you're gonna get in your car, wait till they're on their walk to work... and then... BAM! Drive-by mooning!

[b][anchor=553]#553[/anchor]: Cede Our Seeds? [A Humanist Science; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Biotech firm McSanto LLC has developed a new genetically engineered corn, with 200% more "butter" flavor and a guarantee to be free of those stringy bits that get stuck in your teeth. They've also engineered every mature kernel to be sterile, while marketing a special starter seed at premium prices. Angry supporters of small farms are demanding you lend an ear.

The Debate
1. "These Frankenfood monstrosities are nothing more than a means for McSanto to drive its competition out of business," complains Maize Zea, founder of Stop Engineering Edibles Darnit! "Engineered sterilization prevents small family and subsistence farmers from saving and reusing seed. This means they have to buy all new and expensive seed for every single crop... and only from McSanto! Do the right thing by abolishing genetically modified organisms and engineered sterilization! Don't let the big biotech firms grind @@NAME@@ into cornmeal!"

2. "Engineered sterilization provides us with the ability to ensure that genetically modified organisms stay targeted to farms and orchards, allowing our precious natural spaces and native species remain unblemished. This way, future generations can prosper from better foods and a greener world," recites Stover Cob, CEO of McSanto LLC, reading from a prepared statement, and setting a gourmet popcorn gift basket on your desk. "Besides, without the ability to draw new agricultural business, McSanto wouldn't be able to recover the millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ it spends on research and development. That means less buttery goodness on the table! Show you have some grits - support agriculture and support McSanto!"

3. While fiddling with a toothpick, Dr. Flint Shoepeg chimes in: "No doubt everyone benefits from the improvements companies like McSanto make to our crops. Those stringy bits really are - OW! - um, really are very annoying. But driving Mom 'n Pop out of business wouldn't be right either. Why don't you discourage engineered sterilization, but support my research in chemical-based genetic rights management?" He retrieves some dental floss from a pocket before continuing: "This way, small farmers can still save seed, but McSanto can require the purchase of an activator spray that will turn their value-added features on. Sure, there's a small risk from runoff, but - OW!"

The Issue
A small town in Southern @@NAME@@ has a name so offensive that many official cartographers and government officials are refusing to acknowledge it. The debate has thrust --CENSORED-- into the spotlight, and many concerned citizens are asking the government to step in.

The Debate
1. "Well, I never!" gasps your easily offended Minister of Municipalities, dropping her monocle in surprise, directly into her champagne. "How this town ended up with such a dreadfully appalling name is beyond me. For all that is good and decent in @@REGION@@, I must ask you to change this town's name. Something functional and sensible like 'Pleasant-town' or 'Stepfjord' would have a much better ring to it. Then they can learn to behave like proper, civilised people."

"Seems like majority dinnae want that name appearin' on official maps and websites and suchlike, but guv-ment choosin' a spankin' noo name seems a wee bit too bossy, if yer see what I'm sayin' in the noo.

[b][anchor=555]#555[/anchor]: It's An Honor Just To Be Nominated! [Omigodtheykilledkenny; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Since the news broke that corrupt party boss Tommy Kneehall allegedly used his influence and cash to secure nominations to Parliament for more than a dozen of his closest friends, including both his wife and his favorite mistress, voters have been clamoring for a more open and transparent process to determine which candidates parties nominate for office.

The Debate
1. "What a clustershag," despairs powerless opposition backbencher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who somehow managed to sneak into your meeting. "I mean, even I have to admit, that mistress has a nice pair of 'assets' on her, but are they really qualifications for public office? This demonstrates more than ever the need to take power away from the establishment and the big donors and put it in the hands of the constituents. Let the parties hold open preliminary votes to decide who the nominees for office are. It's fair, it's transparent, it's democratic, and sure, parties may be stuck with a complete basketcase who doesn't know his behind from his elbow, but if it's what the people want, how could anyone possibly object?"

2. "That's a good start, but we have to make sure that voting is limited to members of our Party only," replies @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a small town mayor who has jumped ship to national politics. "If we open things up to everyone, the Opposition could sneak in and plant their own candidates. Remember that blowhard nominee who turned out to be an East Lebatukese spy a few elections back? That was an embarrassment I think we'd all want to avoid again. It may mean losing the swing voters and independents, but we can't let anyone walk in and claim they uphold our values without being properly vetted."

3. "Don't be tempted by populism," warns a shadowy political advisor, speaking from a dark corner while closing the blinds in your office. "Primary elections are costly, they encourage a lot of unproductive infighting, and, frankly, they take too much power away from @@CAPITAL@@. There is a much simpler way to make nominations less corrupt, and that's to make sure every candidate who runs goes through a rigorous ideological purity test. That way the most loyal, and therefore most qualified, candidates are the ones nominated."

4. "I've got a much more classy idea!" declares @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ mogul @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while ogling all your interns. "Why waste our time with votes or vetoes, when we can force all candidates, even the men, to compete in a beauty pageant! It'll be a fabulous show, everyone will love it. Just imagine, a leading candidate breezes through the talent and interview portions, but gets blown away in the swimsuit competition! I know I'd want to watch! The best part is that it won't cost you a single @@CURRENCY@@! Just let me throw in a few ads for my company and products, and I'll pay for everything!"

"Although with recent advances in biological splicing, who knows? If you allotted a little extra in the budget for science, and eased up on some of those research restrictions, we could start creating all sorts of creatures in our labs.

The Issue
While you were conducting an operational inspection of a new @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ National Guard search and rescue helicopter, dispatch received a distress signal from a Personal Locator Beacon, a GPS-enhanced device wilderness adventurers use to request life-saving help. The helicopter immediately raced to the scene, setting down in a remote sun-baked meadow. Unfortunately, the distressed hiker refused rescue, saying "my stubbed toe is feeling better now."

The Debate
1. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a National Guard rescue operative, is exasperated. "This situation is intolerable, @@LEADER@@! In a genuine emergency, these beacons save lives. Now that they're so cheap, more and more people are using them as a crutch to attempt dangerous hikes they aren't prepared for. As you can see, we have to carry the huge risks and costs! Beacon users should have to register with the government, so we know who to fine for false alarms."

2. The helicopter crew patches an incoming call through to your headset. "Hello?" asks famed luxury safari hunter Beauregard Leopold Addington III, Esq. "You know, my friend's business makes satellite phones that can allow rescuers to contact hikers and assess the situation before calling out the cavalry. Sure, the service subscriptions are pricey, and your signa**SSHBZZZTPSSHFTZZPFT**ways get through, but mandatory sat-phones for hikers will reduce false alarms and are great for checking your stock portfolio from any summit!"

3. By this point, you've been standing in the sun for a while, and a mild heat stroke is setting in. Wait - is that bear wearing a tie? "You know, expensive fines and equipment will only discourage people seeking help when they really need it," says the bear while munching a stolen packet of Honey Burr-Berry cereal. "That'll cost lives too. The better solution is to increase funding to national parks, with safe trails, visitor centers, and campsites. Then the common @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ can enjoy @@NAME@@'s natural wonder without the corporations getting their grubby hands on it. It's smarter than the average policy!"

The Issue
When a blind man and his guide @@ANIMAL@@ were recently refused service in @@CAPITAL@@ restaurant 'The Haute Potato', it started a heated debate that few had seen coming.

The Debate
1. "This is a real eye-opener!" exclaims Mathias Murdock, head of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Blind Trust, speaking to a large group of cane-wielding protesters. "This discrimination against the blind and partially-sighted has gone on for too long. Not only should we be allowed to take our companions and guardians wherever we go, now is the time to realize our vision of a society completely accessible for the visually impaired!"

2. "@@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ must be kept out of restaurants; why can't these people see that?" queries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a young chef from 'The Haute Potato', reeking of paprika. "It's not that I don't understand, really, I do, but it's a health issue, you know. Imagine that thing entering the kitchen; you'd get their fur or scales or whathaveyou all over the buffet," she asserts confidently while her sweat trickles down into tonight's babaganuche. "He should just tie his @@ANIMAL@@ outside along with any other mutt. They still have their canes, don't they?"

3. Your @@ANIMAL@@-walker, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has 20/20 vision, rambles at you whilst untangling several leads. "Why are we only thinking of the blind here?

1. "The problem is lack of opportunity," says @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, who so far has been unable to use her underwater basket weaving degree. "The government needs to guarantee that every young person can get a job, maybe to build parks or repairs bridges or design specialty baskets. That's the only permanent way to get @@NAME@@ working again."

2. "What?! Excuse me?" rages industrialist Richard Noseworthy III, nearly knocking over his bikini-clad daughter, who is uploading a pouting selfie to Rich Kids of Instasnap. "The problem isn't lack of opportunity; the problem is greed! The working man is just too greedy! If you scrapped those pesky labor laws, I could employ twice the number of people for the same amount of money, if I so felt like it."

3. "That's an interesting idea, but does it go far enough?" muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while gazing nostalgically at a dilapidated sugar plantation. "There used to be a time when workers and managers didn't have a hostile relationship. Master and chattel worked together to bring prosperity to the land. Slaves served their drivers out of love, and masters provided their slaves with everything they needed, treating them just like their own children. Implementing slavery would bring harmony to the labor process, and it would guarantee job security too."

[b][anchor=560]#560[/anchor]: Bicameral Backlash [Christian Democrats; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ upper house recently voted down a major @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ bill, provoking significant backlash in the lower house. Legislators have gathered in your office, and they're now debating whether @@NAME@@ truly needs an upper house.

The Debate
1. "The upper house is outdated and elitist," argues one of your rather ambitious backbenchers, MP @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is a favorite of the @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ industry. "It's an anachronism, a holdover of a bygone era. Bicameralism belongs to an age when the population was divided into patrician and plebeian classes. In the modern day, it doesn't make any sense. The upper house is a needless and inefficient institution full of overeducated and uppity old farts who only exist to obstruct our progress. It's a roadblock to the will of the lobby - um, the people. @@LEADER@@, empower the people's house! Abolish the upper house now!"

2. "The @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ bill was corporate welfare pure and simple, and that hack knows it," rebukes Lady @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the Mother of the Upper House as she enjoys her snack of camembert and caviar. "We need an upper chamber to give each piece of legislation a sober second thought. Our job is to scrutinize bills for errors and temper the transient passions of the lower house. We need to be given more power, including vetoing dreadful legislation that comes out of the lower house that violates @@NAME@@'s values and customs."

3. "The old woman is right," comments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of the @@DEMONYMAJDECTIVE@@ Electoral Commission. "Our nation needs an upper house to be a check on the lower. After all unicameralism would basically make you an elected dictator with all that unchecked power. At the same time, the upper house's disapproval should not be a death knell for otherwise popular legislation. I have a compromise. Let's allow the lower house to call a snap election if the upper house blocks one of its bills. If the lower house, after the election, passes the same bill again, then it becomes law regardless of what the upper legislators think. Expensive? Sure, but at least we give the people the right to break parliamentary stalemates whenever they happen."

The Issue
Bored by their games of breeze block Tetris and live action Pong, former gamers have arrived in droves to protest against the ban on video games. The gamers, dressed as their favorite Maxemon characters, have asked that you bring back their controllers and consoles.

The Debate
1. "Well, um... you see here, this research shows that video games improve hand-eye coordination, decision-making skills, and encourage creativity and problem solving," mumbles the meek, bespectacled, and incredibly uncharismatic @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shuffling some papers on your desk awkwardly. "I mean, yeah, the games can be addicting and maybe some people were copying what they were doing in the games in real life. You still shouldn't punish everyone just because some noobs can't tell the difference between fiction and reality."

2. "Our children have never been healthier!" joyously exclaims your Minister For Youth And Families, pushing aside disgruntled teens. "Children are actually bothering to learn about their world and getting fresh air and exercise. The problem isn't that they haven't got their digital toys. The problem is that you haven't given them anything to replace it with. Fund more museums, parks, and libraries, and force these tykes to make use of them. The next generation will be better than ever! Sure, it might cost a pretty penny, but it's for the children."

3. "For the children?" yells the stern 64-Star Commodore @@RANDOM_NAME@@, causing the younger children to run away in tears. "When I was a kid, nobody cared about what I wanted. I studied, exercised, and worked my behind off, as these punks should be doing now!" The Commodore glares at the remaining children, causing them to flee the room. "If our children had mandatory exercise or military school, then they won't need video games. We'd turn these hooligans and nerds into model citizens in mere weeks!"

4. "Okay, maybe we shouldn't go that far," muses your cat-obsessed secretary who has pictures of her felines scattered all over your office. "Why not allow some games, but just not the violent ones? There's nothing wrong with innocent games like Gumdrop Kart and Halo Kitten. Just allow games that any child can play without being scared or inclined to violence, and set up a council to rate the games. That way everyone is happy."

However, a recent deployment of WMDs against the rebels' de facto capital city has shattered their burgeoning resistance movement. The source of these WMDs? @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "I can no longer sit back and allow these rebels to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids!" hollers the Central Tasmanian Supreme General somewhat confusedly and confusingly, while seated atop a newly bought @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ ballistic missile. "Fluoride factories, in the rebel heartland. A conspiracy, a foreign substance to poison our essence. Strategic Air Command has the go-code to finish the job. We need another bomb or ten.

2. "Have we learned nothing from this fiasco?" rhetorically asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a peace-loving @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@. "We've got no place providing the tools of megadeath in these overseas conflicts. Let's cut our losses and can the WMD sales before they end up being turned on @@NAME@@!"

3. "What? What? No, don't stop selling weapons, we are not asking for that! Just stop selling weapons to the wrong people!" demands rebel leader Baylor Garner, commander of the Southern Tasmanian Freedom Union. "We can only pay half what the evil Supreme General can, but we are closer to your nation culturally and ideologically, and we're frankly more decent human beings than our mutual enemies.

The Issue
An outbreak of an antibiotic-resistant super-bacterium has killed five people in @@CAPITAL@@, and epidemiologists are linking the emergence of this strain to contaminated chicken meat from poultry given regular doses of antibiotics. Health officials, farmers and consumers are searching for solutions to prevent another outbreak.

The Debate
1. "There's a simple solution," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the @@NAME@@ Public Health Board. "Ban antibiotic use on animals. Antibiotic overuse promotes drug-resistant bacteria, and the chemicals involved are also tainting the food chain. If animals get sick and die, cull them. Super-bugs will be a thing of the past!"

2. "The government must not do that!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Head Poultry Butcher at ChickensBoxed Inc. "We will lose revenue and efficiency! We raise thousands of birds here and antibiotics allow us more meat per unit, more units per square metre and more units per @@CURRENCY@@. You should allow us to use whatever drugs we need to keep the farming industry strong!"

3. "Does anyone forget to mention why chickens get sick?" asks young farmer @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, as he pets Mrs. Tweedy, the favourite of his five chickens. "It's because they are cooped up in cages, unable to move, to develop their bodies, and exercise. The solution is for free-range farming to be mandatory. Meat will then be fresher, healthier and better tasting. We'll need more room, of course, so perhaps the government could donate us some city parks to convert?"

4. "Wait a minute! Has anybody thought about the little guy here? By which I mean, the poor, destitute pharmaceuticals industry?" questions Big Pharma executive @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, as he steps off his private jet. "If you block out sales, our profits will fall by several percent, and jobs will be lost. Perhaps instead subsidise investment into the NEXT generation of antibiotics? That way farmers can use antibioitics all day long, and we'll likely still have new tools to treat sick patients with."

The Issue
Yesterday, a man was struck with a heart-attack in the middle of a busy @@CAPITAL@@ square. As the average @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ simply passed by, a foreigner in traditional garb stepped up and administered an unconventional form of CPR, involving stamping repeatedly on the man's chest, which did indeed save the man from certain death on the street. Unfortunately, the excessive force broke a rib and punctured a lung in the process, and the man later died from complications of this injury.

The Debate
1. "I did what was best to save this person's life, and I did, momentarily," shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while pouring oil and wine on your dying cactus. "I know I'm a shepherd, not a doctor, and the technique I used was only certified to be used on sheep, it is true, but that man would've died without me! It's a moral imperative to help your fellow man, and if people mean well and act accordingly, they should not face punishment for any unintentional and unfortunate consequences."

2. "I saw the whole thing," says @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Demosthenes, who was too busy painting @@HIS@@ nails to actually help. "Now, I don't doubt that this person tried to save the old man, not at all. At the same time, though, that stranger jumped on top of him and began stomping on his chest, and now he's gone; I mean, think of the family and stuff. Some just retribution, or at least a little compensation, is in order, don't you think? That foreigner ought to pay for the damage done. Good intentions can't be enough, it's what comes out the other end that counts."

3. "Hey, who's the doctor, er, nurse here?" bellows Nurse @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose head mirror is both upside down and facing the wrong way. "Emergency medical staff are the only ones who know what's what when it comes to these situations. I'm so sick and tired of amateurs blazing in, failing at cowboy techniques they picked up from some Whotube-channel and doing more damage than good. Laymen shouldn't be allowed to meddle; what we need are organized health patrols with uniformed EMTs on the beat, just like cops. That way, when there's an emergency, people who really know their stuff will be there to help."

The Issue
The problem of 'academic doping' has reared its head after a group of students were caught taking 'smart' drugs ahead of high school exam season. An alliance of concerned educators, anti-drug crusaders, and C-grade students have demanded an end to this practice to make sure that @@NAME@@'s youth don't become a generation of cheaters.

The Debate
1. "These students are doping themselves up to the gills in the hope it'll improve their academic performance," explains Student Union Vice-President for Welfare @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while hurriedly trying to finish an assignment. "However noble their intentions, the reality is that they're abusing drugs. We need the government to fund an education and outreach program, warning of the dangers and offering counselling and therapy. Outreach and therapy will solve this problem more than blunt law enforcement ever will."

2. "Education and outreach? How about I demonstrate some outreach with my truncheon!" screams the Head of Narcotics Control @@RANDOM_NAME@@, accidentally knocking over a plant pot while demonstrating. "I don't care what they're studying: these kids are junkies and derelicts, and we need to clamp down on them. We need strong enforcement, including random drug testing, strip searches, and sniffer dogs in exam halls! Just give us the go - and the money."

*3. "Please, show a little compassion. C-O-M-P-A-S-S-I-O-N. Compassion!" pleads national spelling champion @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while frantically chewing @@HIS@@ nails and twitching uncontrollably.

1.

"Well they're wrong. The government needs more severe penalties to make an example of these criminals. After all, mis-parked cars obstruct the normal flow of traffic and annoy everybody.

"How can someone who barely makes enough to eat possibly pay for a parking ticket? One ticket sets me back half a month and a rich guy only a minute.

You need to force him and those like him to use plain language and get to the point, so that the common people of @@NAME@@ will be able decipher what's going on in the government."

2. "It has been demonstrated," Minister Allen Redbridge replies during an interview, "that markets affect an unexpected multitude of industries at even the slightest suspicion of an impending perturbation. Thus, it behooves those knowledgeable in its idiosyncrasies to uphold their responsibilities in defending such precipitous gateways to knowledge, and acting in such a manner of least reaction, to satisfy their due diligence to avoid creating a condition which could potentially upset the precarious balance between bears and bulls, be they platitudes, or omissions. Indeed, one who acts in contravention to the aforementioned manner also acts against their own best interests, and thereby undermines status as well as dispels their cloak of competence. Such a transgressor shall be dismissed by the knowledgeable majority, of course, thus not necessitating any external provocation."

3. "Spoken or written words, delivered on matters of policy by person or persons within the government, hereafter referred to as a government commentary, constitute a legal statement," explains prominent lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME@@.

The Issue
As the General Synod of @@FAITH@@ gathers in @@CAPITAL@@ for its quinquennial meeting, a group of reformist delegates has proposed an ordinance that would allow both men and women to serve as clerics. The proposal has significant support among @@FAITH@@'s more progressive adherents, but there is a strong opposition movement. The measure needs your backing if it is going to obtain the appropriate amount of support.

The Debate
1. "The times are changing, and @@FAITH@@ needs to change with them," remarks progressive reformist leader @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, bringing out a copy of the Sacred Scriptures. "The Almighty said, 'Let us make human beings in our image and likeness.' And so they were created, male and female the Almighty created them." He turns his head up from the text and looks you right in the eyes. "We're all made equal, @@LEADER@@. That the clergy hierarchy has blocked change for so long is an injustice. We must insist that they permit ordination of both women and men. You know deep down in your soul that it's the right thing to do."

2. "The right thing to do, really?" rebuts @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, president of the Traditionalist League of @@FAITH@@. "For ages, our clergy has been just how it is now. This proposed change has nothing to do with doctrine and everything to do with the creep of secular values into @@FAITH@@." She takes a deep breath and continues. "Women and men, you see, were both created in the divine image and were created as equals, yes. But the Almighty made us for different, complementary roles. The sexes were not, are not, and never will be interchangeable, and @@FAITH@@ should acknowledge this eternal truth by rejecting this heretical proposal."

3. "Science H Logic! Why is this the government's concern?" complains science fiction author and well-known secularist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You have far more important things to do than to listen all day to debates on dogma and the merits and demerits of the sexual composition of their clergy. Frankly, the average @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ on the street doesn't really care about this issue. If anything, you should cut all funding to @@FAITH@@.

In a backwoods part of @@NAME@@, two neighboring families who have been feuding for generations are continuing to commit acts of violence upon each other. Members of the Caphill family killed a beloved friend of the MacDoogle family, "Ol' Man Jack", after a dispute over a farm @@ANIMAL@@. In response, a group of MacDoogles raided the Caphill household and killed the three men responsible for Ol' Man Jack's murder. The case of the Caphill-MacDoogle feud has gained national media attention, and there are calls for you to step in.

The Debate
1. "THEY DONE STARTED IT!" thunders Young Man Jack, waving a pitchfork menacingly toward the Caphills. "They killed my friend! Now, lookie here @@LEADER@@, we done did what we knew was right and avenged 'im. So why don't you and the coppers just stay outta our affairs, ya hear?"

2. "Three of my boys are gone 'cause of them. I thought I'd have their love till the end of my days, but it turns out there's no love in this story, just tragedy," weeps Anna Caphill, who has been alive for eighty years and has almost as many children. " @@LEADER@@, I demand you take in the ones responsible for this and hang 'em high, just like the good 'ol days."

3. "Now now, clearly the issue at hand goes back much further than this unfortunate incident," quips Dr. Laurence Friar, one of @@NAME@@'s top psychiatrists as he scribbles on his notepad. "There are decades of resentment and misunderstanding to be worked out. It is obvious that these slack-jawed yokels need some therapy and reeducation in order to be integrated back into civilized society. If they don't come willingly to their sessions, then the government can take their children away until they do. Give me some time, and some funding, and I'll transform these backwoods delinquents into model citizens in no time."

4. "Reminds me of a similar situation a few years back with the Jetter and Sharkley families," recalls @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Krupke, a cop from the west side of @@CAPITAL@@. "Tragic business, we had to end up relocating both families to opposite ends of the country. Just do the same with the Caphills and the MacWhoevers, and if they start up feuds with their new neighbors, I'm sure there's some barren, uninhabited islands we can ship them off to."

[b][anchor=572]#572[/anchor]: Reading, Your Rights [Gelimor; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Schools and public libraries have historically selected what books can be found on their respective properties, and many have taken this a step further, actively banning unsuitable books from being read under their roofs. A group of legally-minded high school students are challenging this practice, claiming that this is an infringement of their civil rights.

The Debate
1. "My brain, my choice what to read!" exclaims 11-year-old prodigy @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a copy of the controversial novel [i]Fifteen Shades of Violet[/i]. "How can we learn and be exposed to new ideas if not through the words of great authors and writers? People need books for thought like they need air to breathe. No authority, be they governmental, religious or corporate should be allowed to ban books for any reason. Now, if you could ask Teacher to return my copies of [i]The Manual of Home-Made Explosives[/i] and [i]Thoreau's Civil Disobedience[/i], that'd be great."

2. A woman with a bright red face storms into your office with a toddler hanging off her leg, and slams a copy of [i]The Bluest Eye[/i] on your desk. "Think of the children! Actually, think of the parents! How can we relax if our children are reading books about crime, child abuse or sex or worst of all, liberal politics? If a library or school thinks a book shouldn't be read, then we should show a little trust in their judgement. Now, my son is very advanced..." She pauses to stop the tyke picking his nose. "...and when he's older, he can read more at home. But not at this age, and not without supervision!"

[3]. Online, a guy with a unicorn pizza avatar named xChickSaitama93 sends you an Insta-Message, which pops up on your screen. "LOL. Y U need books NEway? Duz NE1 even reads those things anymor anyway. =S havnt picked 1 up since highschool ... you shud ban paper. #4ENVIROMENT yeh?"

[b][anchor=573]#573[/anchor]: The Road To Blackacre Ends Here? [Zwangzug; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
As the Blackacre Olympics approaches, your diplomatic advisors have questioned whether @@NAME@@'s athletes should travel to a country known for civil rights abuses. Activists and athletes alike are taking their marks in your mountainside chateau, ready and set to go on with the debate.

The Debate
1. "You cannot deny us this opportunity after we've been training for years!" proclaims champion shotputter @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while descending into a crouch. "By sending our finest athletes to Blackacre, we can show the world what @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are made of. Let's show the world how much better our glorious @@TYPE@@ is. These fascist Blackacre weaklings will have no choice but to bow down before our athletic superiority. Give us a chance to succeed on the world stage, and we'll make @@NAME@@ proud!"

2. "Have you seen what they do to — GAAAA!" shouts Foreign Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dodging a cast iron ball flying toward your desk. "...ahem, uh...wa-what they do to peaceful protestors? Attending these games would make a mockery of everything our great @@TYPE@@ stands for. For the sake of our values and everything that is good and decent in @@REGION@@, @@NAME@@ must boycott the games!"

3. A flurry of snow bursts through your door, followed by a cross-country skier. "Their internal politics are none of our business," says National Sporting Committee President @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, as she stows her ski poles and rifle in a large hole in your desk. "Look, why not let our qualified athletes compete independently? That way, the government can officially disavow the games, while @@NAME@@ still unofficially kicks some backside in the field. Plus, this will make it easier for us to get around restrictions on, um, nutritional supplements. Yeah. Supplements."

4. As soon as your aides close the door, it bursts open again as an upside down bobsled drifts into your chateau, stopping just before your priceless Maxtopian vase. Your aides turn around the bobsled, revealing the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ bobsled team, who came in last place at the previous Winter Olympics. "Yo, mon, what if @@NAME@@ hosted its own sporting competition for like-minded nations?" asks the captain of the team, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as the team steps up to lift the bobsled over their heads. "Our sportsmen and women deserve the chance to compete in these games, but most of us don't feel comfortable in these tin-pot dictatorships. This way we all get to compete and we send a message to our enemies." The bobsledders walk out of your office, as everyone in the room begins to slowly applaud the team.

[b][anchor=574]#574[/anchor]: One Small Step For Private Enterprise? [New Birgland; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Private space companies have expressed a desire to launch a space probe to the moon and other planets in the solar system. To avoid any legal entanglements, they have asked for permission from the government to launch.

The Debate
1. "The sooner we get off this rock, the better," grimly predicts daredevil CEO Dick Benson, who recently broke the record for the world's highest skydive. "We all know it's a matter of time before we destroy this planet, and exploring the vastness of space is our only salvation. Private enterprise must be allowed to develop space technologies. I'd go so far as to subsidize private space companies to help them on the way to the stars. 'Per pecunia ad astra', as I always say."

2. "Space shouldn't be opened to corporations!" exclaims buxom @@NAME_INITIALS@@SA engineer turned beachwear model Ellen Janeway. "These companies just want to grab our heavenly bodies and make money from them. The stars themselves will be exploited and stripped bare! Only the government - by which I mean you - can be trusted to handle things properly."

3. "Both sides have a point," acknowledges your diplomatic Science Minister Bill deGrasse Hawking. "The free market must be allowed to operate, but with reasonable rules and regulations. The idea sounds daft, but an asteroid mining company should be subject to the same laws governing terrestrial mining companies. We should have some sort of prime directive that state what we can and can't do up there. This needn't cost us tax dollars either: just have the enterprises involved sign an agreement to abide by the rules, then let them go boldly where no corporation has gone before."

4. "You've ruined this planet. Now you want to ruin outer space?" queries Gaia Peacedove, an eccentric environmentalist and host of the esoteric television show 'Antiquated Aliens', seen dressed in hemp fiber. "Cleanliness is next to godliness, after all. The Ancient Ones didn't want us to come to them, they will come to us. Stop polluting space with your fancy-schmancy space probes and rockets! Ban all space exploration, and focus on protecting the environment. They will surely see this as a sign that we are ready for their arrival!"

[b][anchor=575]#575[/anchor]: Sick Days For Sick Waves [Australian Republic; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
At the height of an extremely hot summer along the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ coastline, many workers have taken multiple 'sick days' to go to the beach and had the misfortune to run into their bosses, who have 'taken work home' to their seaside properties. Your chief employment analyst has estimated that the economic damage of the good weather has been significant, though he says he'll get back to you on exact figures once he recovers from an unexpected bout of period cramps that are keeping him off work today.

The Debate
*1. "We lost a whole summer!" says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your Minister of Productivity, while adjusting his swimming costume. "We can't just shut @@NAME@@ down whenever it's a bit too hot - our economy would go broke. Of course there's nothing wrong with bumming around the beach, but not while you're being paid... How about we allow companies, rather than employees, decide when somebody is sick enough to stay home from work. That'll put an end to their malingering tricks!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2.  "We lost a whole summer!" says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your Minister of Productivity, while adjusting his swimming costume.

How about we allow the government, rather than the people, decide when somebody is sick enough to stay home from work. That'll put an end to their malingering tricks!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

3. "I'm not a bludger because I take a few sickies," complains @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a surprisingly tanned data entry worker from his basement cubicle. "I mean cm'on, you can't 'spect us to work on bloody scortcha! Maybe you could make all places of work close down when the weather is really good, then we can go to the beach and not worry 'bout it. I mean, what's more important, a barbie and some beers with yer mates, or more bleedin' work?"

4. "Why can't we just start working on beaches?" asks @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a bikini-clad beach beauty who persuaded your doorman to let her into the meeting. "I mean let people take the papers and printers and stuff to the beach and do the work there! Pay people for the work they do, not the hours they are in the office. Flexible workplaces are more productive, so you should be subsidising and encouraging with appropriate legislation."

5. "I don't really understand what the attraction of sunny beaches is supposed to be," notes dermatologist Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, closing your blinds for you. " People just need to be reminded that too much sunshine and beach-side indulgence can be bad for you. There's skin cancer, sunburn and all sorts of nasty creatures, like sharks and jellyfish. Have you seen the size of their teeth? Sharks, I mean, not jellyfish. Here, look at this photo of this man whose skin fell off after he got stung. I've got that picture in a Public Health leaflet, you just need to distribute them..."

[b][anchor=576]#576[/anchor]: Light At The End Of The Tunnel [Kievan Rusk; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
A 33-year-old man, who has chosen to remain anonymous, has been refused state-sanctioned euthanasia by his doctors because of his diagnosis of severe depression. He's pointing out that this depression is exactly why he wants to die, and is asking that the right to merciful death be extended to allow his medically-assisted suicide.

The Debate
1.  The patient in question, avoiding eye contact and speaking flatly, makes his case: "I've felt like this since I was a child, I've been through every medication, seen a hundred counsellors, even had ECT blasting my brain. They've all done nothing, nothing at all. I'll take my own life if I have to, but wouldn't it be better if I could end my life painlessly and comfortably?"

2.  "You see where this slippery slope has brought us to?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, of lobby group 1stDoNoHarm. "You tell people it's okay to kill themselves, and that's what they'll do. You tell doctors its okay to let people die, and that's what they'll do. What's next? Murdering the learning-disabled or those with the wrong skin colour? Change the government's message, @@LEADER@@. Choose life."

3. "I sympathise with this man's situation," says neuropsychologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, showing no outward signs of being sympathetic at all, "but allowing suicide and banning euthanasia are both choices that are just running away from the bigger problem: chronic, intractable depression. We need a review of root causes, more mental health funding and a drive towards exploring experimental new treatments, like neuroaffective immunotherapy. Spend more on mental health and social services; cut other departments or raise taxes if you have to: this is a national crisis."

4. "Well, life is pretty damn pointless," says Nia Liszt, leader of a new movement calling themselves the [i]Self-Destructivists[/i], "so why don't we just end people's misery once and for all? We humans have had a terrible impact on the planet and suffering is inherent to life. You should donate some public money to my crowdfunded "kill-starter": I'm looking to engineer the perfect virus that will wipe out all human life forever. There's a little fine tuning to be done, but in the meantime, you can buy access to my existing research, which will probably help you develop some biological WMDs, or whatever else you like to occupy yourself with. I mean, who cares? It's all ridiculous, anyway."

[b][anchor=577]#577[/anchor]: Second World Problems [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Lenyo] [/b]

The Issue 
The ongoing ideological struggle between capitalist and communist nations shows no sign of letting up. At a meeting of 'second world' nations, opinions vary on how international socialism can be best achieved. The Party has asked you to put your weight behind one of the more popular approaches.

The Debate
1. "We're surrounded by a hostile camp of capitalist powers," lectures the borderline paranoid @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ after preemptively surrounding her lectern with concertina wire. "The only logical solution is building a bastion of socialism impervious to any and all foreign aggression. @@LEADER@@, with closed borders and an ever-increasing military budget, we will finally be safe from imperialist encirclement."

2. "Come join the bloc party!" enthuses @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while handing out BBQ to everyone in attendance. "We need to form a Solidarity Pact, committing our nations to mutual defense and strategic cooperation. By sharing administrative functions and industrial investment, we can create a group of communist countries with steadily increasing living standards, and isn't that what socialism's all about? Who wants a kebab?"

3. "We have a duty to publicize the wonders of socialism," preaches socialist realist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while coloring in propaganda posters with a red felt-tip pen. "People suffering under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie need to know that true happiness, by which I mean their class interests, lies with the worldwide proletarian movement. After all, winning the battle of ideas is far more important than getting stuck in another arms race."

4. "Hmmm, sorry what? I wasn't listening," says a rotund Party member with an expensive watch and the latest media tablet. "Perhaps we can get some sort of compromise between the economic benefits of private industry, alongside our ongoing socialist program. I mean, have you seen some of the cool stuff coming out of those capitalist countries?"

[b][anchor=578]#578[/anchor]: Support Your Local Arms Manufacturer [Golgothastan; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue 
After the Conglomerated @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Arms Syndicate announced yet another setback in the development of a promised new fighter jet, the Hell-@@ANIMAL@@ 3000, the Ministry of Defense is considering the previously unthinkable: importing from overseas.

The Debate
1. "You can't! If you cancel the order, we'll go out of business, putting @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ workers out of a job," pleads Conglomerated @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Arms Syndicate liaison, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We couldn't have reasonably anticipated the problems refitting the cockpit to make it windproof. We'll have the jet finished soon; I swear. In the meantime, maybe a generous contribution to your PR campaign would help convince you?"

2. Commodore @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Navy Chief of Procurement, is sick of the delays and cost overruns in the Hell-@@ANIMAL@@ 3000 project. "We were promised this plane three years ago, at half the price. This is getting ridiculous. It's time we found a supplier who can actually deliver on what they promised - even if that means importing from one of our overseas rivals."

3. "Why stop at fighter jets?" argues Colonel @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has recently returned from an officer exchange program with suitcases brimming with gadgetry. "We should be inviting all the foreign arms firms to come and bid to completely replace all the rusting junk our Armed Forces currently has to put up with. Just imagine our brave soldiers fighting with cutting-edge jet packs, thermal detonators, and knockout gas! Some would call importing supplies un-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@; I call it progress."

*4. "Do you realize how many jobs that would cost, you blithering idiot?" foams union organizer Robyn Payne, diplomatic as ever. "Our arms industry employs people in every district, so you'd better listen to us... and if the fat cat bosses aren't running things well, then maybe it's time we nationalized! Under government control the factories will be churning out guns and ammo at twice the rate! And twice the price..." [[color=red]Must have Autocracy[/color]]

The Issue 
"Concerned for Cursive", a mothers' advocacy group, have staged a mock funeral for handwriting - a practice which, they claim, nears extinction.

The Debate
1. "We are gathered here today to pay our respects to the memory of our nearly departed: cursive handwriting!" says head of the CFC @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "The government must act now. Require handwriting for all school assignments or watch our sweet and beloved cursive fall by the wayside like, err, stamp-collecting... and erm, the neighborhood milkman."

2. "I OBJECT!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, nosy parker. "We do that at funerals, right? 'Object'? But I object to this nonsense. It doesn't matter how kids are writing, but what kids are writing. We should be giving them free laptops to keep up with the times and stay competitive rather than keeping them in the dark ages!" 

3. "Nev'r understood what all them fuss was about 'andwriting," mumbles Deegan Holhs, an illiterate gravedigger. "Them schools should be teach'n kids the very basics. I nev'r needed to write nuff'n, so why should they? Quit that academic blither-blather and set our youngins up with them thar marketable skills."

[b][anchor=580]#580[/anchor]: @@NAME@@ Taking Leave Of Its Census? [Zwangzug; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue 
When the latest National Census asked citizens to specify everything from their shoe size to number of sexual partners, leading privacy activists and the casually paranoid started raging that the process has become too intrusive and that the anonymity of the respondents is at risk. 

The Debate
1. "Enough, I say!" melodramatically rails Warren Brandeis, while angrily doodling crude images of the male anatomy in every tick box on the census form. "With this level of detail, any hope of anonymity and personal privacy will be but a distant whisper. Why should we trust the blasted establishment to know every single detail of our lives, let alone where we live? I have no intention of entrusting the government with my full demographic profile, and I implore anyone with a shred of decency and respect for the sanctity of the domestic sphere to opt-out of this Orwellian intrusion!"

2. "Nonsense!" counters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, policy wonk at the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Bureau of Statistics, dotting the i's and crossing the t's of an essay question. "Without accurate and meticulously detailed census data we'll be completely lost! How can we make informed decisions when there's no information? How will we know what areas of the country to target with our... welfare programs? No, we need to have greater authority to make sure everyone is filling out the census!"

3. "Yee-haw, pardners," strums country-music star @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "No need to bring out the big guns there fella, I'm sure these fine folks would be just gosh-durned happy to fill out all of your ticky boxes, if you get them in the right mood. Let me and my friends churn out some songs advertising the glories of checking boxes, and you'll have them lining up to submit all the data you want in no time! To make sure they really, really get the message, you should make all them medias play our hearty honky tonk exclusively during census-time! Now ain't that a peach?"

4. "Let's be reasonable here," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, manager at 'Surveys R Us', while wielding a sharp pair of scissors. "Me and the gang can trim down and freshen up the census for you - a slice here, a dice there - and make it into something so feel-good and inoffensive that nobody will object to answering it. Granted, the results will have to be a bit more, eh, let's say 'aggregated', but I'm sure the boys at the Bureau will manage to make somewhat informed and semi-relevant estimates nonetheless."    

[5]. "Do we really need a national census anyway?" yawns @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a meme-analyst at social media site MyFace, who is using the form as a paper airplane. "It's a lot of trouble for nothing, if you ask me. If you want to know where someone lives or what their spiritual animal is, you add them on MyFace like everybody else.

"Let's show off our tech to the rest of the world! We need flying cars and… and… cyber@@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@! Yes, a cyber@@ANIMAL@@, with a frickin' laser beam on its head!"

The Debate
1. "These are needless tragedies!" complains your concerned Public Safety Minister, angrily smacking your phone out of your hands, and denying you the ultra-rare Lenyutwo you were about to snatch. "Hundreds of people have already been hurt and we had our first death just last week, all just to get some virtual monster thing!

In recent weeks, a neighbouring nation in @@REGION@@ released a controversial and gory movie about @@NAME@@, entitled [i]The Baker Of @@NAME@@[/i]. The movie, which follows the horrifying journey of a hapless ex-baker into the criminal underworld of @@CAPITAL@@, seems to imply that @@NAME@@ is a dystopian hellhole filled with violent crime. Unsurprisingly your citizenry is offended. 

The Debate
1. "This movie makes us look like lawless bloodthirsty savages... and they claimed we eat @@CAPITAL@@ Cakes all year round, when everybody knows that we like @@CAPITAL@@ Scones these days!" complains scowling patriot Marshall Kim J. Unn, dousing a stack of movie promotional posters in kerosene, tossing the offending nation's flag onto the pile, and lighting a match. "Not only should we ban this evil slanderous movie, we should also demand an apology! Deploy tanks along their border, and warn them to withdraw the film, or face the consequences."

2. "Woah, like chill out dude, get a sense of humour,"  says satirist Sacha Sagdiyev, lighting a spliff from the bonfire. "These people just don't know what it is actually like to live here. So, why don't we show them? Get some tourists in, get them high on magic mushroom muffins, flood them with love. Getting angry never solved anything, man."

3. "Lies and videotape, eh?" muses Lenny Groovesteel, your Propaganda Minister, reading a psychology article on [i]The Triumph Of The Will[/i]. "Two can play at that game. We should direct our own movie directors to churn out some counter-information, singing our nation's praises and fabricating something nasty about theirs. Have you heard people talking about the disgusting Dog-Hair Muffins they bake? No? We will fix that."

The Issue 
Last weekend, a roller coaster malfunction at Six-hundred Flags Theme Park resulted in dozens of people left hanging upside down from stationary carriages for almost half an hour and one passenger injured badly from the fall after she released her own safety harness to get down. Outraged by a perceived lack of safety, concerned parents are now pushing to have something done about the dangers posed by amusement park rides.

The Debate
1. "MY CHILD COULD HAVE DIED ON THAT THING!" vents overprotective mother, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "And the mess... vomit in his hair was the least of his problems: he's always had weak bowels, poor thing. These roller coasters are clearly a danger to the public. Not to mention that people actually waste money on those godforsaken things. I say we ban them right away, along with any other rides that could put my baby boy at risk."

2. "That's a little excessive," concludes your uncle, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, while attempting to child-proof your office. "When properly regulated, amusement park rides pose no danger. So the only reasonable thing to do is to hire a lot more health and safety inspectors. That way tourists can visit our nation's rides and restaurants without fretting about their own safety."

3. "That sounds like a waste of money," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, director of the infamous amusement park, after literally taking candy from a baby. "This was totally an isolated incident that in no way reflects upon my park's safety or popularity. I can't believe people are panicking so much over a couple of broken ribs and a snapped neck. Everyone knows that necks naturally repair themselves. Let me reopen my park tomorrow, and I'll have all the ride malfunctions fixed. Eventually."

4. "Woah, so cool!" opines wannabe daredevil @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who appears to be improvising a motorcycle out of scrap iron and kerosene. "The only thing cooler than feeling like you're on the brink of death is actually being on the brink of death. Just scrap all those lame safety rules so we can get some real excitement! Super dangerous, but that's just part of the thrill, man."

[b][anchor=586]#586[/anchor]: School's In For Summer? [Aipotu Ruo; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue 
Your Education Minister recently proposed abolishing the traditional @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ school schedule, which included seasonal breaks, and replacing it with one in which school days were evenly distributed over an entire year. In response, concerned administrators, parents, and educators have asked for your support.

The Debate
1. "Everyone knows how much time parents and educators waste regurgitating the same information every year," complains obnoxious parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, seen wearing a 'My Child Is An Honor Roll Student' button. "Students often forget things when they spend long periods of time without learning. In order for these young minds to flourish, we should keep the same number of weeks of education per annum, but spread them out evenly across the year. That will make my - I mean, @@NAME@@'s - children's successes even more pronounced!" 

2. "That is ridiculous. Can you even imagine all the overhaul that would require?" questions principal @@RANDOM_NAME@@, after giving two of your squabbling aides a time out. "The budget is strapped enough as it is! A better solution would be to allow each school to determine its own schedule. That's better for the administrative workings of this public school system, and our finances. Besides, educators need breaks too! Teaching those little hellions is far more stressful than it looks!" The aides begin squabbling again, prompting a stern glare from the principal. "You two! My office! Now!"

3. "Restructuring alone won't keep our children ahead of the curve!" opines @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Comptroller of the @@CAPITAL@@ District School Board who had been grading everyone on their posture and speeches. "What we need to do is make education free and mandatory all year round, fifty-two weeks a year and six days a week. Yes, that means massive spending towards the education budget, but you can't put a price on knowledge. Well, I guess you can depending on how much goes into the budget."

[b][anchor=587]#587[/anchor]: I, Robot, Do Solemnly Swear [Luna Amore; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue 
Last week, a humanoid robot announced its intentions to serve as a the nation's first android federal judge. Concerned citizens have come to you as to the implications and legality of this potential appointment.

The Debate
1. "Surely we cannot allow this, right?" asks Chief Justice @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ while curling the end of his beard around his finger. "Letting them vote would be one thing, but robot judges? What if it malfunctions or someone tampers with it? We need to put an end to this right now. If we manufactured it, it shouldn't be allowed to serve in the judiciary."

*2. "He's a – it's a WHAT?" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Zero Tolerance. "This robot had to be made by someone right? You don't see how that could go horribly, horribly wrong? It's clearly a power grab by someone with deep connections at the Friendly Robot Company. We need to conduct a full on investigation of the entire industry and this robot; who made him, who paid for him, what he is capable of – the works!" [[color=blue]Must have AI Personhood[/color]]

We need to conduct a full on investigation of the entire industry and this robot; who made him, who paid for him, what he is capable of – the works!" [[color=red]Must not have AI Personhood[/color]]

4. "If I may disagree," politely asks iCroft Holmes, the robot nominee. "A robotic judge has numerous benefits that the esteemed gentlemen are deliberately omitting. We can view decisions in a rational and analytical manner, unburdened by emotions. We would make decisions for the betterment of the people. The judiciary would become streamlined and efficient. Surely, these are virtues the government wants?"

**5. "I warned you!" scolds noted technophobe @@RANDOM_NAME@@ after smashing your telephone. "But no one would listen. You became dependent on these soulless machines, integrated them into every facet of your lives, and look, now they dare to judge us! We've got to rid @@NAME@@ of these toasters once and for all! Ban artificial intelligence and bring some sanity back to our country!" [[color=blue]Must have AI Personhood[/color]]

[b][anchor=588]#588[/anchor]: Last Call For Alcohol? [The Dalatian Republic; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue 
The @@CAPITAL@@ Police Department has reported an upsurge in alcohol-related crime in recent weeks, with bar-fights, vandalism, and street violence all on the rise. Now, with a drunken city councilor involved in a street brawl with an equally drunk Brancalandian ambassador, it is perhaps time for you to intervene in the embarrassing levels of booze-fueled mayhem.

The Debate
1. "These pubs are cesspools of crime and delinquency!" rages Temperance League founder and avowed pacifist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, throwing a bottle full of perfectly good beer on the floor, smashing it. "And don't forget the broken families and long-term health problems associated with drinking yourself to death! The government must ban all alcoholic drinks and shut down every last bar in @@NAME@@ in order to safeguard public safety."

2. "Maybe just a selective ban? After all, beer doesn't get you drunk nearly as quickly as whiskey or vodka," proposes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has the difficult job of cleaning up all the messes in the Surly Wench Pub. "Just set an upper limit of 6% ABV. That way people still have a way to blow off steam, but they'll be a little less likely to smash bottles or brawl over the @@ANIMAL@@ball game."

3. "I can do... what I want... with my body," staggers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is already drunk at 10 in the morning. "The government should just get off my... back." The sot abruptly falls down.

[b][anchor=589]#589[/anchor]: To Boldly Go? [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
As the government prepares for its latest budget, the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Space Agency is looking for direction from you. Petitioners have been transported to your office to present their ideas.

The Debate
1. "We should seek out new life and new civilisation," implores William Kirk, an elderly utopian SF author and astronomer. "There are trillions of stars, and it's mad to believe Earth alone harbours intelligence. There might be alien green-skinned lovelies, just waiting for contact with a real man. We need telescopes and exploration probes, aimed at the second star to the right, and straight on till morning. Show some enterprise. See what's out there... That-away."

2. "They call it a space race, but being first at any cost is not always the point," suggests reformist politician Patrick Picard, looking suspiciously at five lightbulbs illuminating the room. "Attend to the small details at the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Space Agency. Are they assimilating all the men and women needed, in an equal and fair fashion? Sometimes a counsellor can be of as much value as a pilot." He takes a sip of hot Earl Violet tea. "I may be accused of being overly methodical, but these things matter. Suspend launches for now, and attend to infrastructure. Make it so."

3. "Space, I regret to say, is a dangerous place," offers gruff base-commander and part-time gourmet chef Avery Sisko. "It's not just about science, nor about being an emissary for corporate profits. It's about security. Near-Earth space is getting crowded, with a multitude of nations seeking absolute dominion. You don't want the East Lebatuckese to get any further with their space program, do you? Who knows what they're doing up there with that Sputnak satellite? We need a new kind of space ship, to show our defiance of those agendas. One with guns. Lots of guns."

4. "Is anyone else here kind of bored?" yells young tearaway William Kirk Jr., revving his motorbike as he rides into your office, in clear contravention of rules and regulations. "We gotta make space exciting again for people, make the old things new again! Not just dry data and lore for tech-geeks, but awesomeness for ordinary people who like explosions, and lens-flared sunsets, and stuff like that. Reboot the Space Agency! Let's have firework displays, televised low orbit skydiving, and celebrity astronauts with great hair! I dare you to do better!"

[b][anchor=590]#590[/anchor]: When Trees Hug Back [Czechostan; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue 
With a significant portion of deaths in @@NAME@@ stemming from people simply getting lost in the vast wilderness, a debate has commenced on the merit of having such an expansive and bustling environment.

The Debate
1. "Seriously, the trees are out of control, man," complains aging hippie @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, while wrapping a warm blanket around his cold feet. "Look, I love Momma Green as much as the next guy, but there are literally trees and foliage everywhere! I can't even see the street from my house, and this morning I was nearly mauled to death by a pack of saber-toothed @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ when I went on a trek to retrieve my mail. Can't the government lay off on a few of the environmental regulations and stop declaring anything with leaves a national park? You know, at least let me mow my lawn, man."

2. "Okay, so some people are getting lost in the woods," remarks Minister of Environmental Affairs @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a bureaucrat so grey she makes pavement look like the Technicolor Dreamcoat. "Don't blame nature for human error. Give my department some increased funding, and I'll have the Rangers go out and discreetly mark some safe trails between our major population centers." She ogles your shriveled potted plants with cold, dead eyes, and says: "You know you're required by law to water those bi-daily, right?"

3. "Behold! What we are witnessing is the twilight of modern civilization and the grunge of industrialization," declares aspiring primitivist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clothed solely in @@A(ANIMAL)@@ pelt, while stretching both arms upward and revealing two miniature valleys of woodland. "I read somewhere that before the emergence of states and industrialism, everyone lived peacefully in small, egalitarian, cohesive societies. We're almost there again, and to ensure that everyone can truly live and die among the roots and vegetation of nature, we must begin the complete deindustrialization of @@NAME@@. It'll sound terrible to some, sure, but don't knock it til you try it." 

4. "Talk about missing the point!" coaxes @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, known biophobe and CEO of an all-but-destitute wood-chipping and mining firm, 'Tree's Company, So Mine Your Own Business'. "The rising percentage of people dying in the wilderness is proof that man and nature were never made to interact beyond the shaft of an axe or a shov…" He pauses mid-sentence, face turning wan and frozen at the sight of your potted plant. After regaining his composure, he continues in a high-pitched voice: "Eh, where was I… Yes, that's it! Abolish all green regulations and spending, and allow the eager lumberjacks and miners of @@NAME@@ to access forest and field so we can fight back and civilize the environment! Trees will always grow back, and surely the hippies at the Ministry of Environmental Affairs can't demonize a few subterranean rocks being removed?" [[color=blue]Must have Capitalism[/color]]

5. "Talk about missing the point!" coaxes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, known biophobe and six-times winner of the State Lumberjack Championships. "The rising percentage of people dying in the wilderness is proof that man and nature were never made to interact beyond the shaft of an axe or a shov…" he pauses mid-sentence, face turning wan and frozen at the sight of your potted plant. After regaining his composure, he continues in a high-pitched voice: "Eh, where was I… Yes, that's it!

[b][anchor=591]#591[/anchor]: Bait And Switch [Lenyo; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue 
Children wept today, as only a handful of fish showed up for the 'Dance of Salmon' – an eagerly awaited tradition celebrating wild salmon migration from the ocean to the riverbeds of @@NAME@@. Experts and deep-sea anglers have pointed fingers at the abundance of open-net fish farms dotting the coast, which allow sea lice-infected farmed salmon to contaminate migrating wild salmon, threatening the very survival of the species.

The Debate
1. "Salmon are a crucial link in the food chains of both the ocean AND river systems!" asserts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a surprisingly knowledgeable 10-year old, clutching a tear-drenched plush salmon. "The wild stocks of both Maxtopia and Blackacre are already irreparably depleted by sea lice and overfishing, and if we do nothing, @@NAME@@ is next. You need to severely tighten regulations for the farm barons: make them clean up their act before it's too late!" 

*2. "What's the worst-case scenario? They're extinct in twenty years or so? I'm eighty-six; I'll be extinct in ten," reasons ridiculously wealthy fish farm owner, Bjørnar Laksekonge. "This is really making a mountain out of a molehill. Look, if you just equate wild salmon with caged salmon in your government counts, I think you'll see the problem disappearing overnight. I'm sure my boys can train a couple of our fish to swim upriver once or twice a year, nobody will care: a salmon is a salmon, right?" [[color=blue]Must not have Geronticide[/color]]

*3. "What's the worst-case scenario? They're extinct in twenty years or so? I'm fifty-five; the government will make sure I'm extinct in ten," reasons ridiculously wealthy fish farm owner, Bjørnar Laksekonge. "This is really making a mountain out of a molehill. Look, if you just equate wild salmon with caged salmon in your government counts, I think you'll see the problem disappearing overnight. I'm sure my boys can train a couple of our fish to swim upriver once or twice a year, nobody will care: a salmon is a salmon, right?" [[color=red]Must have Geronticide[/color]]

4. "People, people! Let's forget about the salmon for a while and talk about the lice!" pleads @@RANDOM_NAME@@, disgraced marine biologist and amateur chemist. "The louse - scourge of the salmon, free or farmed; wouldn't it be nice if you could just make them go away? Well, you can! I've been working on a new type of pesticide targeting just this kind of situation. It's still experimental, that's for sure, but if you let fish farmers douse their tanks with my stuff I'll guarantee that your lice problem will be a thing of the past, all while keeping your fish nice and sound. Actually, I'm not 100% sure about the fish, but the lice will definitely die!"

[b][anchor=592]#592[/anchor]: Infamy! Infamy! They've All Got It In For Me! [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
Two days ago a series of pipe bombs in @@ANIMAL@@ City killed two people and injured twelve more. By yesterday morning, the news was full of pictures of the perpetrator, with reporters explaining his twisted manifesto and giving the terrorist's ideology far more exposure and media presence than he could ever have achieved without violence. Like many others, you find yourself watching an evening TV program dissecting the events of the last few days. 

The Debate
1. "Boy, am I glad they caught that monster?" asks chat show host @@RANDOM_NAME@@ hopefully rhetorically, just after airing a thirty minute segment profiling the killer. "Now... some on this panel were saying earlier that having his face and picture all over the airwaves was counter-productive. I disagree! We're showing the public that crime doesn't pay. It's in the public interest, because... uh... because the public is interested! It's also about history, and recording events for posterity. That means it's actually the [i]duty[/i] of the media to put up the names, faces, methods and manifesto of these ratings-boosting psychopaths."

2. "With that haircut, I'm surprised YOU aren't the one we're condemning," jokes fellow panellist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, to thunderous audience applause. "In all seriousness though, it's not right that we're playing right into this terrorist's hands, spreading his message of hate and making him a celebrity. People died, man! We should have an enforced code of conduct, asking the media to be responsible in reporting. After all, publicising an agenda of hate is the same as promoting it. Consign these killers and their whack-job thoughts to the oblivion of history where they belong."

3. "Why don't you all shut up and go home?" yells a heckler from the audience. The camera pans round to show an angry red-faced fellow with a cooking apron on. "I had tickets for [i]Celebrity @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Bake-Off Factor Live[/i], and then they tell me that it's been cancelled to make room for this stupid show. Hey, @@LEADER@@, if you're watching, ban this sort of news and documentaries, and keep TV for what it was made for... Entertainment!"

[b][anchor=593]#593[/anchor]: A Right to Bare Arms? [Escalan Corps-Star Island; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
Despite a conservative attitude towards nudity in @@NAME@@, recent analyses of fashion trends suggest that women's sleeves have been getting progressively shorter in the last few months, sometimes to well above the elbows. Outraged moral guardians have come to you to ask for nationally enforced standards of dress.

The Debate
1. "This is outrageous!" wails @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, founder and chairwoman of the conservative activism group Modicum Of Modesty. "@@LEADER@@, everyone knows that increased promiscuity among young girls can be directly linked to the square footage of skin showing! Sexual abuse, objectification and falling educational standards are all direct consequences of nudity: I have the statistics and evidence, from a study that my own organisation completed! I beg you, mandate conservative skirts and long-sleeved blouses. A lady's wrists and ankles should be covered!'

2. "Don't listen to that harridan: she's got ugly arms, and that's why she wants to hide," scoffs @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a teenage student at one of @@CAPITAL@@'s rowdiest schools. "Look, I don't get over-excited every time I catch a glimpse of shoulder or thigh. I mean sure, some people take it a little too far, but shouldn't that be their responsibility? She can cover up if she wants, but prettier girls should be able to show a little skin."

3. "I think we all know what's going on here," chides popular feminist speaker @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ as she bashes the previous speaker over the head with her protest sign. "We hear stories of assault and abuse, and it's chalked up to be the girl's fault for wearing something that 'invites it'. This is a clear case of double standards – nobody ever says anything when a man rolls up his sleeves to get to work. We need to change the mentality that holds women's clothing choices to blame for the actions of men. We should be able to walk down the street naked if we want to, and not be blamed or shamed from doing so."

[4]. "Since when have we let the women of this country determine its morality?" rages traditionalist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, his wife and daughters standing behind him in fearful silence. "A woman's nakedness is for her husband to behold, and for none other. All women should be forced to cover themselves head-to-toe while in public, and should not venture out of the home without permission. They should obey their husbands or male relatives in all things, including their clothing choices." [[color=blue]Marriage is legal[/color]]

[b][anchor=594]#594[/anchor]: Tie Fighters [Drasnia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The national election is over and election officials are painstakingly counting every vote. The results are expected to be close and one electoral district, @@ANIMAL@@ Valley, has already seen a tie. The incumbent, cabinet minister Jennifer Nike and her challenger, Violet Utopia each amassed exactly the same number of votes. The candidates have already begun fighting, both with each other and with election officials at the Electoral Commission of @@NAME@@, prompting the first major debate of the new political session.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, as the incumbent for @@ANIMAL@@ Valley I believe I have the right to represent it again," demands Mrs. Nike after arguing with a nearby election official over whether an 'X' or a check-mark constitutes a spoiled ballot. "Precedent should always be given to maintaining the status quo, and officials should not be deposed or replaced except by a two-thirds majority. That'll give us some political stability, and give you and me a chance to get things done."

2. "@@LEADER@@, I demand a re-vote!" exclaims the increasingly paranoid Violet as she meticulously reviews paragraph forty, subsection two of the Election Code, which deals with re-votes. "We all know how corrupt this government is. I swear your goons have been stalking me! We need to hold a new election for the district. If the results are within 10% of a draw, then we'll keep on holding re-votes until I, uh, someone wins!"

3. "As always @@LEADER@@, I have the perfect solution!" declares your gambling addict brother who makes life decisions by the roll of the dice. "Why not have tie votes determined by a coin toss? It's simple, fun, and doesn't show any favoritism. We could bet on the outcomes and even apply the same principle to the legislature!" He then takes your prized antique ancient golden Maxtopian coin and flips it. "Fifty @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ on tails!"

The Issue 
A high profile case where a police officer used lethal force against a criminal suspect that he claimed "posed immediate danger" has the populace divided. Some claim he was defending himself in the line of duty, others that he was abusing his power. Lack of witness testimonies or evidence is making investigation difficult, and many are suggesting that the government should outfit all of its police force with camera equipment to record events as they transpire.  

The Debate
1.  "Cameras. Cameras would be good." intones Patrol Officer and jungle war veteran @@RANDOM_NAME@@, twitching nervously and scanning the skyline for rooftop snipers. @@HE@@ takes a moment to look a thousand yards into the distance. "People don't know what we've seen. They don't know what it's like to wear this uniform, to be a target, to know that each patrol might be the last. I know war, and it's war out there on the streets. If people could see what we have to deal with each day... they'd understand. Give me a camera, and I'll show them what it's like out there."

*2. "Look, I'm not saying I don't trust our fine police officers," whispers transparency advocate @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Juvenal, carefully moving any weapons and sharp objects away from the tremulous police officer, "but cameras are needed not just to support police testimony but also to protect the public from police excesses. The only way they can serve that dual purpose is if the police don't control the cameras. Have 24/7 cameras on every police vehicle, surveillance drones following cops on patrol, all the footage streamed live on the internet, and stored on an open-access cloud.

4. "Bwaahh?!?" exclaims moustache-twirling driving-goggle-wearing charlatan @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who was definitely not trying to tie your secretary to his toy train tracks. "Police with cameras? This is a breach of my civil liberties! What about privacy? Do we not have the inherent right to go about our daily, lawfully abiding lives without fearing these paparazzi pigs parading our precious picturesque moments to the putrid public as perfidious publications? Say no to copper cameras! Keep your eyes off my private business!"

The Issue 
Due to the reigning monarch's lack of heirs, which could conceivably cause a succession crisis, the aristocratic elite have begun to question the ancient law of primogeniture.

The Debate
*1. "I'm the eldest child, so I should get the throne!" shouts Princess @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@, who has a reputation for being completely undiplomatic. "It doesn't matter that I'm a woman. I should have the same rights as a man to the throne. Why should the crown pass over me because of my genitals? It's arcane! I mean, having a monarchy is arcane too, but never mind that..."

[b][anchor=597]#597[/anchor]: You Can't Handle The Tooth [A Humanist Science; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue 
A few days ago you needed triple root-canal surgery, and despite your codeine-enhanced prescription you're still in agony. However, your dentist has refused to prescribe anything stronger! You're now back for your check-up, wondering if it's time to think about relaxing the regulations around the most powerful painkillers.

The Debate
1. Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your personal dental care professional, sits down on a stool next to you, and lowers the back of the chair to the horizontal. "Open, please? Good. I'm sorry @@LEADER@@, but you know the drill. Easier access to narcotics will only lead to more widespread abuse. In reality, many pain 'patients' are just junkies looking for a fix. The primary purpose of medicine is to cure disease, not to enable addiction! Instead, consider adjusting healthcare policy to stress cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, and other non-pharmacological interventions. Spit, please?"

2. "ummm**HUUURP**..uh, yuck," says Dental Nurse @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who you know is also a spokesperson for Patients Against Interdicting Narcotics, while emptying a recently-soiled emesis dish into the medical waste sluice. "Yeah, that's precisely the wrong thing to do. Insufficient treatment of pain is very common, especially among women, ethnic minorities, and the poor. The elderly are also at risk, since many wrongly think that pain is just a 'normal' part of aging. The most severe cases can even drive people to suicide! Medicine should focus on quality of life, not just curing disease. Do the right thing, and ease restrictions on powerful painkillers now!"

3. While you're still supine, a strange pale-skinned man shines the dentist's lamp directly into your eyes and begins loading a large metal syringe from an unmarked vial. "I have your solution right here, dear leader. Why not add these powerful painkillers to the water supply, under the banner of a new healthcare initiative aimed at relieving stress and improving quality of life? Then you can use mass addiction to control the population! A particular district doesn't like your new absolutist platform? Just reduce their 'pain relief' until they do! Imagine the whole populace desperately begging you for another hit!"

[b][anchor=598]#598[/anchor]: A Violet Trojan Horse [Crazy Girl; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue 
Rumors tell that the Order of Violet has infiltrated schools in @@NAME@@ to brainwash the youngest generations. Fears of Violetist takeover have prompted all other faiths to unite for the first time ever.

The Debate
1. "Preposterous!" dismisses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of the @@CAPITAL@@ District School Board, while hiding an Order of Violet signet ring. "Our schools are performing well, and the children are merely learning to understand different points of view. The only hatred I see is from the hypocrites and paranoid kooks who have no problems forcing their values on our innocent children."

2. "Terrorists! Terrorists everywhere!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a controversial and xenophobic politician, who inevitably tries to win every debate by claiming all opposing views equate to supporting terrorism. "Screen all teachers, headmasters, and aides for possible Violetist ties. Force the schools to adopt an unapologetic pro-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ curriculum. We all know these Violetists hate everything @@NAME@@ stands for! Anyone who disagrees is a terrorist-sympathizing, Violetist-loving, traitor!"

3. "That doesn't go far enough," claims the leader of The Tranquility of Yellow, an ancient religion that has a just as ancient feud with Violetism. "These heretics have been a danger ever since the Grand Schism, and they must be dealt with accordingly. I suggest we start up an inquisition. My people will find these Violetists, and see if they can be converted to our true religion or renounce their faith. Whichever one the government prefers. We're not picky. If not... the stake. BURN THEM ALL! Or hang them. Just get rid of those creepy Violetists, okay?"

4. "What are we? Barbarians?" queries popular agnostic speaker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose personal motto is 'Question Everything'. "I don't see anything wrong with teaching Violetism. Not every Violetist is some crazed wacko, you know. However, schools should teach all different faiths, including non-belief, in a neutral and understanding way in the interest of fairness. If we want to eliminate hatred, the schools are a good place to start."

[b][anchor=599]#599[/anchor]: Dead In The Water [Aculea; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue 
Massive fertilizer-fueled algae blooms in the South @@ANIMAL@@ Sea are quickly depleting aquatic oxygen levels and suffocating marine life. Vaguely aware of this fact, you are on a poorly-planned fishing trip in the South @@ANIMAL@@ Sea arranged by the Ministry of Agriculture. The fishing expedition is intended to impress foreign dignitaries, but you can't help but notice that there are more strategic locales for a PR stunt, areas that aren't a sickly brown color. All the same, you cast a line into the water, and a few seconds later the fishing rod bends and flexes wildly.

The Debate
*1. "That must be a big piece of garbage. There's no way you'll catch any fish in that dead water." concludes @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, an unabashed nihilist and CEO of DrillBabyDrill. She jabs a finger at the open sea, adding, "This proves that it's high time to give up on environmental regulation altogether. If you want to squeeze some more production from this pool of filth, abolish those obsolete pollution laws hindering my offshore oil rigs. There's nothing left to protect, after all." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. "That must be a big piece of garbage. There's no way you'll catch any fish in that dead water." concludes @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, State Director of National Oil.

If you want to squeeze some more production from this pool of filth, abolish those obsolete pollution laws hindering my offshore oil rigs. There's nothing left to protect, after all." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

3. A hard pull on the line drags the rod out of your hands. @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a retired senior captain from Something Fishy, makes a diving catch for it and wrestles with whatever is on the other end. He exclaims, "If that's a fish, we must find out how it miraculously lives in lifeless water!" He continues to struggle with the fishing rod. "But if it's only trash out there, then the only way to save the fishing industry - and the environment - is to strictly limit the fertilizers causing this dead zone in the first place."

4. With a wrench and some salty language, the captain lands the 'fish,' a woman in a scuba suit. Floundering on deck, she fumes, "Aggh! I can't see anything down there, with all that gunk from the estuary! Rumor has it there's shipwrecks down there, but I've never seen one. Look, the problem here is chemical fertilizer run off from farms, so why not fix the problem back at the farms with better chemicals? Oblige the farmers to add chlorine bleach to the water supply in proportion to the fertilizers they use, and your rivers and seas will boast crystal clear water!"

The Issue 
After the street outside your personal residence proved incapable of handling a diplomatic motorcade and @@NAME@@'s biggest house party at the same time, your Foreign Minister has suggested that the state procure and maintain an official residence for you to live in.

The Debate
1. "It is absolutely essential that you have a home away from home," insists your Foreign Minister, pointing excitedly at an interior design magazine from before you were born. "Imagine if the ambassador had been run over by that party bus! An official residence would keep you and your honoured guests safe from the hooligans, the thugs, and the public. In fact, we can turn the residence into a Museum of @@NAME@@'s History, with a veritable cornucopia of cultural artifacts on display. It would be a perfect reconstruction of our glory days and as an added bonus, the police can keep the kids off your lawn."

*[2]. "You're not just a memory - you're our future," chimes in t-shirt aficionado and social media CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "@@NAME@@ doesn't need to be reminded of its past! This won't just be a home - this will be a technological revolution!

4. "Oh, please. I'm all for keeping government out of the bedroom, and that counts doubly for yours," snarls libertarian and small-government proponent, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who gets worked up if the government so much as fixes a pothole. "You can drive, or take a cab, or hire a personal bus at your own cost. A house shouldn't be any different. Since when should the taxpayers be asked to foot the bill when half of us don't even like you? If you want to be taken seriously, go and rent an apartment in @@CAPITAL@@ with a couple of roommates. Leave us taxpayers out of it, okay?"

5. "I'm with the anarchist, I want no part in building your ivory tower!" declares decentralization activist, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, founder of several, competing local governance associations. "What you need is to really get out there and see all that @@NAME@@ has to offer. You need an official, open, and accessible residence. Why not get yourself a mobile home and tour it around the country, town by town, like a rock star? You aren't too good to talk to us commoners, you know - if anything, it's the other way around!" He spits on your desk and turns his back on you.

6. "Don't listen to that traitorous anarchist!" pipes up your lazy, entitled niece who just woke up from a nap on your couch. "Of course you need a personal residence, for you and your family! Imagine a grand castle, complete with servants, a hedge maze, and massive golden statues of yourself! Your home would be the envy of leaders across @@REGION@@, and anybody who complains can be thrown in the dungeons for our amusement. Just bulldoze a forest somewhere and start construction NOW!"

[7]. "Come on, the ambassadors love my mojitos!" drawls your neighbour, and now-legendary party host, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What if, like, your current digs were just a bit more open? You wouldn't need an official residence. We'd just use your place! My home is your home, and I'm sure all the fun people of @@NAME@@ would love to party with those foreign dignitaries of yours.

[b][anchor=601]#601[/anchor]: Lawyers On Trial [Tzarsgrad; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
Notorious gangster Johnny 'Stab-Stab' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ was recently found 'not guilty' on multiple charges leveled against him, despite a broad expectation from citizens and the media that he would be convicted. Experts are saying that the surprising result was the consequence of Johnny hiring the very best private defence lawyers, while the prosecution was led by an inexperienced and overworked public prosecutor who was so tired he could barely keep his eyes open through the case.

The Debate
1. "Zzzzzz... Huh? What? Wasafargit blarg?" garbles public prosecutor Ivan Anap, as you nudge him into wakefulness. "Uh... Look, I've done a bad job, clearly. But have you seen my case load? I gotta represent the downtrodden masses and the... wossname... penniless crowds. The system deserves more money, so we can get better public servants, and so I can get some... some... slee..." He collapses, face-first onto the floor.

2. "Don't mind Rip Van Winkle here," growls 'Filthy' Harold Callahan, a cop with little love for lawyers, kicking the sleeping attorney in the gut. "All these 'public servants' are doing is clogging up the system, and keeping justice from being served. I say scrap the system entirely and keep honest taxpayers from paying for the bureaucracy of criminality. Let people hire their fancy-schmancy punk lawyers if they want to, but don't make ME pay for those bottom-feeding scum. Let's have less talk and more justice."

3. "That's ridiculous, obviously," says government minister Justitia Caecus, as she searches for a pair of dropped contact lenses. "Public defenders and prosecutors are obviously something we can't afford to lose. But why not go further? Why not have every individual be assigned state representation only, regardless of financial standing? That would go a long way toward promoting true justice within our nation. Sure, the lawyers might complain that you'll be making them public servants on a public service wage, but don't we care about fairness and justice?" 

4. "But still, it won't be truly fair, will it?" muses futurist Diana Moon. "Even randomly allocated lawyers will vary in ability. I've been reading about something called Vonnegut-handicapping: using external devices to create equality of ability. Allow both private and state-funded lawyers, but fit them with a shock collar that gives them distracting electrical shocks throughout a court case. The greater their recorded success rate, the more often they will receive shocks. That way, everyone will eventually receive the same level of expertise in their legal counsel. Flawless logic, correct?"

2. Dance instructor @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ waltzes into your office. He takes your hand and begins a foxtrot. "Isn't this invigorating? Come, let me teach you to pirouette around delicate situations you may encounter."

Lay off plz! Imo, the government should be supporting us artists! Like by giving me money for being awesome. Next story haz Gay Gandledore setting a dozen Angel-Dragon-Goblins ablaze. 4 teh lulz."

*4. "There is a solution to this issue that is absolutely fair, though its a teensy bit complicated," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former copyright lawyer begging for change on the street corner. "You can let people write freely, but at the same time allow for civil court claims for portions of profit, based on the contribution to the creative process the original ideas-makers have. So, if you've got a Demon-Wizard in there, then the author can claim a few percent; if you've got an orc in there, then the George JK Token estate can have a chunk; if you've got a style reminiscent of another author a few percentage to them; and so on.

The Issue 
After renowned food critic and criminal mastermind Hannibal Terwilliger published a book entitled [i]Food Behind Bars: A Gourmet's Journey through @@NAME@@'s Prisons[/i], a debate has sprung up over the quality of food served to prisoners.

The Debate
1. "This is ridiculous!" fumes single mother of three @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, whose ex-husband is currently behind bars. "Here's me struggling just to give my kids the basics, and he's sitting in a nice warm cell with nothing to do all day but eat like a king! I say we stop this extravagance and redirect the funding into something more appropriate, like welfare for single parents. Prisoners should only be fed what they need to survive."

2. "Oh come now, there's no need to treat us like animals for the sake of a few misdemeanours," says Mr. Terwilliger via a satellite link from an undisclosed minimum security prison. "We prisoners have rights too, you know. Oh what a cruel world we would live in, if a man can't chow down on cordon bleu just because he's behind bars. Now warden, can I have some fava beans and a nice chianti delivered to my cell? I'm starving."

3. "Of course you have to feed prisoners, but what kind of food?" muses oblivious naturalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while watering your plastic office plants. "It's all these preservatives and cheap imported foods that have made these people violent in the first place! Why not establish prison farms and have inmates eat what they grow? Sure, it would tie up lots of fertile land, and there's always the risk of an escape, but the benefits to society are worth it."

"Well, look here, you've got all these mouths to feed, and you don't want the expense?" queries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Fried @@ANIMAL@@, one of @@NAME@@'s most popular fast food chains. "Looks like this here's something the private sector can help you with, and by private sector I mean my company! Just grant us the exclusive right to provide catering in all of @@NAME@@'s prisons, and we'll keep all those prisoners stuffed for a fraction of the cost!

Outraged serfs are striking in the streets today, after the newly appointed Duke of @@CAPITAL@@ flippantly subinfeudated the capital's West End to a wealthy foreign investor, bestowing upon him peons, mesne lordship rights and a lesser noble title.

"Bringing back the oppression of serfdom was bad enough, but now you're giving away our homes, us, even, to a foreigner?" shouts a mud-stained @@RANDOM_NAME@@, proud WestEnder and this week's executive officer of a local anarcho-syndicalist commune. "The only thing that outlander ever did for @@NAME@@ was invest in that so-called Duke's business! There's nothing noble about perpetuating the economic and social differences in our society. Down with feudalism! Give us back @@NAME@@ the way we like it. Boo!!!"

2.

"Remember why we did this in the first place: to ensure an obedient and productive workforce that will help us win a place as a powerhouse in the international economy. Let us quell the commoners and teach them their proper place! Anyway, my old Maxtopian mate from boarding school is looking to get into cotton - are you terribly attached to @@ANIMAL@@ Park?"

3. "We need to return to the good old days, when a noble title was recognition of good blood," contends @@RANDOM_NAME@@, draped in the flag and failing miserably to rip a foreign banknote in half. "Our nobility shouldn't bring dirty foreigners into the centre of our economy; the only people allowed to own businesses and serfs should be @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ through and through - people like you and me."

Determined to make their point strongly, an intimidating gang of Customs Police Officers and Revenue officials have arrived at your front door with sacks full of junk: home-copied DVDs, knock-off imitation designer clothes and dodgy electronics gear. All these are illegally traded goods, seized today within a mile's distance of your own home. The black market is out of control, they say, circumventing both industrial standards and retail taxation. 

The Debate
1. "We must break illegal trade with the direct application of brute force!" roars Revenue Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, incandescent with rage. "Send in the police force! Send in SWAT teams! Destroy these outlaws and punish their customers! Undeclared trade is tax evasion, and tax evasion is [i]rebellion[/i]. Crush the rebels!"

2. A cockney fellow in a long trench coat sidles up to you and whips it open in front of you. To your relief, the only thing he is exposing is a selection of fake watches hanging from the inner lining. "Cor blimey, guv'nor, the black market is just us geezers exercising a bit of cheeky chappy freedom! Duzzit do yer harm? No it don't! Duzzit make people chipper? Yes it does! Just have the old rozzers leave us in peace, and turn a blind eye or two to stuff falling off a lorry, and we'll all be laffin' our way to the bank. Now, would you like two Rowlex timepieces for the price of one?"

3. "He has a point... The black market's size is indicative of a free economy's response to government over-regulation," observes @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a far-more respectable looking businessman, presenting you with some colourful line-graphs to support his argument. "Relax those regulations, and economies of scale will allow legitimate private industry to triumph, and the proportion of economic activity dominated by the black market will likely fall.

The next election is drawing near, and over drinks you flippantly mentioned to a few Party loyalists the idea of extending the political season to a whopping sixty-nine days. Upon hearing the plan, your campaign manager immediately passed out from an overwhelming panic attack, fearing the agony of such a long campaign.

The Debate
1. "I'm not sure what you hope to gain with this," gasps @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your trusted campaign manager, while holding a cold flannel to his forehead. "The Party's funds can only be stretched so thin, and it's only a matter of time before one of our candidates does something outrageously stupid that sabotages our reputation. What we need to do is make sure the election dates are fixed, with a fixed length and fixed results... I mean, fixed rules on campaign spending! Once the people see how open and transparent we are, we'll all be re-elected in a landslide."

2. "The longer, the better!" enthuses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your top donors, who is rumored to have made a killing off the Wezeltonian War. "Prolonged election campaigns will bleed the Opposition dry of their campaign funds, while giving us more time to ask for donations and publicize the competition's scandals.

The Issue
A 3-year-old girl, named @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@, recently died from a nasty chest infection. The case was notable, as doctors are claiming that a simple course of penicillin could easily have saved her life, and are laying blame for the death upon the advice of a 'spirit-energy healer' who advised the girl's parents to treat their child with acupuncture.

The Debate
1. "Allowing these fraudsters to kill children with their pseudo-medical claptrap should be criminal!" shouts Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a famed debunker of alternative medicine, as @@HE@@ slaps a hot mug of soothing echinacea tea out of your hands. "The same standards of evidence-based practice and criminal responsibility that doctors face should be forced on these conmen.

My guitar just may steal your face right off your head, stick it on a rock-rocket and then set the controls for the heart of the sun! Ya know, man?! @@LEADER@@, you can even jam with us if you give us the space for this festival!"

2. "I don't know about this!" worries @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, an angry old man. "These darn hippies want to be flooding my town with their drug paraphernalia, their smelly bodies, their electronical guitars and their 'popping' music! Keep these drug-fuelled, fried-egg-brained layabouts out of our great nation! Say no to drugs! Say no to subversive drug music! Say no to young people!"

3. "How about we have the festival, but supply enough police presence to keep the drugs out?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former weed-smoking spiritualist turned substance-abuse counsellor. "We can have our police force monitor the festival, and maybe also have an anti-drug awareness campaign working the festival, and some consultation work to minimise local disruption and environmental impact. We can have a good time and keep the drugs away... It's all about the music, isn't it?"

[b][anchor=610]#610[/anchor]: Only @@LEADER@@ Could Go To Dàguó [Drasnia; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
The Holy Emperor of the militaristic and isolationist nation Dàguó has invited you to his palace for a state dinner in an attempt to warm decades of frosty relations.

The Debate
1. "IT'S A TRAP!" shouts Admiral @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ de Calamari, a military attaché who seems borderline paranoid. "Isn't it obvious? They're only inviting you over there so they can KILL you! They'll either poison you or stab you in your sleep. Trust me, you can't trust these Dàguó animals. They will kill you the moment you let your guard down."

2. "I agree that we shouldn't go over there," replies @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your personal chef, who is always dying to experiment with new cuisine. "However, that doesn't mean we should ourselves embark on a policy of isolationism. Why not invite this Emperor of theirs over here and treat him to a state dinner? There's much to discuss like their Tasmanian trade sanctions or the steady stream of refugees from the Maxtopian Civil War."

3. "Dàguó's leaders have historically denounced our great nation for covert operations that, err, officially, we still deny," mentions Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@ between introductory college lectures. "Meeting with Dàguó's Holy Emperor would be a perfect way to begin to mend relations. Accept the invitation, respect their customs regardless of how strange they might seem, and act like a real national leader for once! Go out there and start advocating for world peace, and history will thank you."

[4]. After repeatedly hitting on your secretary, a somewhat suave secret agent introduces himself as, "Bont ... James Bont. Go over to Dàguó on the pretext of a diplomatic mission. Meanwhile, I will pose as a Marche Noirian master chef so I can poison the Emperor's meal. Once he drops dead, his security is going to suspect foul play, but I'll be there to extract you back to @@CAPITAL@@ via rocketcar. There's a chance my scheme will end up causing a war, but if worst comes to worst, I've still got my jetpack and exploding attaché case." [???]

[b][anchor=611]#611[/anchor]: Blundering Battle Bureaucrats [Free Syllvin; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
After stepping off the path in @@CAPITAL@@ Park to take a picture of @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@, a Bigtopian tourist was subject to @@NAME@@ Defense Regulations Volume 4, Bylaw 8-A, Chapter 23, Section G-17-5, Paragraph 4b and was subsequently obliterated by a full battalion of @@NAME@@'s finest.

The Debate
1. "That's just how our glorious nation operates!" says @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the Sub-Minister of Internal Affairs of the Defense of the Internal Affairs of the National Sub-Committee of Sovereign Urban Parks. "We didn't get where we are today by letting those dirty, out-of-line foreigners trample our carefully manicured petunia bushes!" She tries to wave a copy of the @@NAME@@ Defense Regulations Volume 4 at you for emphasis, the sheer bulk of the tome forces her to resort to instead slamming the book onto your desk. The legs creak under the weight. "We need more safeguards against external aggression: no entry signs in multiple languages, tracking anklets issued at the border, oodles of barbed wire, and high-yield minefields! Summer tourists and all other miscreants like them are a threat to society, and if we need to have a show of force to keep them in line, by the @@TYPE@@ we should do so!"

2. You can hear yelling and a rising deep rumbling crescendo of noise, then a main battle tank bursts through the doors... and part of the wall. The top hatch opens, and Colonel @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ (the officer in charge of the "apprehension" of the unfortunate tourist) pops out. "Now you listen to me, @@LEADER@@, the last thing we need is more handsy-pansy suits getting in the way of our work! We should have no more requests to obliterate, signed in triplicate, sent in between 0800 and 1500 hours, sent back, queried, lost, found, subject to public inquiry, lost again, and finally discovered in the basement of @@CAPITAL@@ Library underneath a treatise about gummy worms!" The Colonel pulls a handgun the size of a small dog from his waistband and drops in onto the regulation almanac. The legs of your desk groan. "Give the military control over how to dispose of all these pesky law-breakers. We've been dying to test out these new [i]@@NAME@@-made Super Obliterator 3000s[/i], anyway!"

3. Your butler pours you a cup of tea, having materialized from the mysterious dimension butlers go to when they don't want to be noticed. "It appears to me, @@LEADER@@, that the problem lies within @@NAME@@ rather than without it. You can hardly blame people who visit our glorious cities for being in awe and thus forgetting their place and indeed, what place they are in." He places the delicate teacup on top of the obscenely large gun and size-of-a-child rulebook. "Having too many government committees, unnecessary departments, and too many soldiers can only lead to more debacles like this. Cut the administrative overgrowth, downsize the defense forces, and possibly funnel that money into something more productive, like education, or butler salaries." His thin mustache quivers expectantly.

4. The family of the dead tourist manages to climb over the armored vehicle in your doorway and into your office. The deceased's mother, who is especially distraught, approaches you with tears in her eyes. "Why does no one ever think of the people affected by all this! We're here to sight-see, not to get our family killed by your thugs! How does stepping off a park path even warrant deployment of a surface-to-air missile truck or a ninja team? We can't keep on going not knowing when the next of us will step out of line and be run over by a tank! We demand an apology, a change to the law and reparations!" The distraught woman gently places a photo of her dead son on your desk, which promptly collapses.

[b][anchor=612]#612[/anchor]: A Petty Issue [Sammuramat; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Your cousin's adored pet @@ANIMAL@@ has died.

The Debate
1. "It would mean the world to me to have my loss properly recognised," sobs your cousin, dabbing tears away with a gold-embroidered handkerchief. "My poor little baby deserves a state funeral. Imagine... people crying in the streets, a band playing funeral dirges on golden tubas, and my dearest little [i]@@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ McFluff[/i] immortalised in a memorial forever... you'd do it for your own pets, wouldn't you?"

[2]. "Y'know how many people this could feed?" asks roadkill-chef @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, sniffing at the carcass, and licking her lips. "And y'know how many people you're takin' cash away from with a big state funeral? Burying @@AN@@ @@ANIMAL@@ is a waste of good meat, and a waste of money. Y'should buy up all the dead pets, butcher them for meat, and donate the food to the poor and homeless." [[color=blue]Must not be vegetarian[/color]]

3. "No need to bury the wee beastie!" yells eccentric special effects expert @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I've been playing around a lot with taxidermy and animatronics, and I reckon if we fix up damage to the bodywork, apply some preservatives to stop the rot, install some motors and simple AI subroutines, and the little critter will be good as new! Also, why stop with pets? You miss your grandma, right? Let my company work its magic, and look who's back!"

[b][anchor=613]#613[/anchor]: A Nude Day, A Nude Awakening... [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Internet news sites and online communities are abuzz over supposed leaked nude images of you that surfaced online this morning. Amateur photo-manipulation experts have concluded that the images are fakes, but the files have already spread across the internet like wildfire. As the victim of this internet trolling campaign, it may be time for you to address the problem of faked images of this sort.

The Debate
1. "Here we have thieves and perverts, stealing your likeness and creating obscenity," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a country singer of dubious talent who claims there have been more downloads of fake nudes of @@HIM@@ than downloads of @@HIM@@ music. "Every time I go online I see these filthy pictures. It's humiliating, degrading, and feels like a violation of my privacy and a kind of sexual assault. I guess now you know how it feels too! I know this is hard to police, but you could at least make photo-manipulation without the consent of the subject illegal, with fines for those who break this law or who distribute these images."

2. "Kirby Streisand agrees, but Kirby Streisand thinks that we should go further," agrees the notorious Kirby Streisand, a staunch censorship advocate who once tried to remove all references to @@HIS@@ name on the internet. "If it were up to Kirby Streisand, any unauthorized image, name usage, or even a likeness of a person without their permission should automatically be taken down whether it's on the internet, the news, or any random video."

3. "Either everything is okay, or nothing is," refutes satirist and online columnist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whilst using a clever piece of software to make a mildly angry photo of you on a bad hair day look like you are a positively psychotic murderer on the verge of going on a killing spree. "Are you going to censor the Moaning Lisa because she was painted without her knowledge? Are you going to ban a schoolboy from drawing a moustache on a newspaper photo of your face? You have no right to censor art, and photo-manipulation is art. Quite frankly, celebrities and politicians should give up their expectations of privacy. If you don't want people drawing you nude, you shouldn't have chosen a career that makes you famous."

4. "Face it, you can't stop people putting things on the internet," suggests your tech-savvy nephew, who moonlights as notorious internet troll [i]politichunt42[/i]. "But you can affect an image's notability, by changing its context. Say we fake a few hundred nudes of a dozen other world leaders, and maybe some politicians and public figures you don't like: we could make it so that your faked nudes are old news, and have everyone laughing at your rivals and opponents instead. Wouldn't it be fun to watch them like flail around like a @@ANIMAL@@ with its head chopped off? Is it immoral? Sure, if somebody hadn't obviously already done this to you. Can you say 'hackers-sponsored-by-Blackacre'?"

[b][anchor=614]#614[/anchor]: How Much Is That Vote In The Window? [Burned Lands; ed: Nation of Quebec & Logophilia Lyricalia][/b]

The Issue
After recent elections in @@NAME@@, journalists calculated that over eighty percent of the money donated to candidates came from less than a dozen notable corporations. After years of protests about the corruption in the election system, several major voices have finally managed to sneak or bribe their way to your desk.

The Debate
1. "How could we let this happen?" moans Debbie Eugenia, spokesperson for Citizens United for Responsible, Sane Elections. "Well, it's pretty easy," @@HE@@ says as @@HE@@ shows you a complicated diagram linking various politicians to numerous corporations. "For years our nation's elections have been subverted by dark @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ from unaccountable private donors! You can see the chains of corruption laid out right here - go on, look at the flow chart!" Indeed, there are some prominent politicians' names on the chart, but you don't have time to make much of it before @@HE@@ continues. "It's long past time to put real limits on how much can be donated in an election! ARGH," @@HE@@ faints after being hit with a tranquilizer dart.

2. As your staffers drag the unconscious body of the activist away, two activist CEOs known as the Kone Sisters make their case. "Please don't listen to this wacko," pleads @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Kone, who donated over a million @@CURRENCY@@ to the mayor of @@CAPITAL@@'s campaign last year. "We need to be able to give freely if we want to truly represent our wealth - I mean, the people's voice! If anything, we should be thanking the donors for picking the right candidate." @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Kone, who donated to the mayor's rival last year, interjects. "Maybe we could dip into the government's coffers to refund their donations to the winning campaign. Think of it as a boon to competition – raising the stakes like that will lead to better business models and better candidates!"

3. Out of nowhere Hayek Freedman, Professor of Economics and Philosophy at the University of @@CAPITAL@@-Oldtown, falls through your ceiling, then still somehow manages to strut calmly to your desk. "Hold up a minute, @@LEADER@@. Neither of these lunatics knows what they're talking about. Allowing such huge campaign donations is incredibly wasteful; the whole economy would be better off without that drain. Yet we can't deny that indeed, corporations are people, my friend. So how is it we still haven't given them the right to vote? Economic justice means instead of 'one person, one vote,' we say 'one @@CURRENCY@@, one vote!' We'll just give natural persons AND corporations one vote for each @@CURRENCY@@ they earn every year. If you truly want to hear the voice of the people, not to mention cut way down on tax evasion, then let their wallets speak for them!" :kiss:

[b][anchor=615]#615[/anchor]: Tempted By The Fruit Of Another [A Humanist Science; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A Fruit Juicing Plant owned by farming conglomerate [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Farms[/i] proved unprofitable and was closed down when everything went pear-shaped, with local employees laid off in their hundreds. A few weeks later, its former workers broke through the padlocked gates and brought the machines inside back to life, starting a collectivist [i]@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Manufacturing Workers' Co-operative[/i] which soon turned a modest profit. Now the buildings' owners want their factory back. The workers' co-op has met the police in the streets, and things are about to go bananas.

The Debate
1. "This factory is mine! I have the deed right here!" yells [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Farms[/i] majority shareholder @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from the safety of a sea of well-armored riot police. "How do you like them apples? Really, it's precisely this sort of commie nonsense that is responsible for the economic downturn in @@NAME@@ to begin with! Everyone knows these lazy peasants don't have the plums to build a real enterprise. But, now that MY factory is turning a profit again, I'm happy to buy their labor! You know, at a small discount."

2. "Oh, so you have some quaint little deed? Who gives a fig?" asks @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, an award-winning documentary maker, while simultaneously signing copies of her new book [i]The Shock Logo[/i]. "Why does the law protect the rights of failed business owners while leaving the workers out in the cold? Haven't these workers also invested their very lives into this factory? Life gave them lemons, and they made lemonade! Don't sacrifice their families and their lives to that bunch of sour grapes... Change the law to allow workers to take direct and democratic control of abandoned factories!"

3. "Look, this 'self-management' thing sounds all peachy keen, but it just plays into the same tired capitalist narrative," says red turtleneck-clad political theorist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, while wrinkling his nose at a tattoo-laden protester. "Characterizing the suffering of the working class as merely an 'investment' plays directly into the hands of the bourgeoisie. And what do a bunch of pea-brained individuals know about proper management anyway? Can one factory provide jobs for all? Clearly, the state should seize factories for the good of all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@!"

[b][anchor=616]#616[/anchor]: You Are Feeling Very Very Sleepy And Not At All Gay [Golgothastan; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A controversial new health center has opened in @@CAPITAL@@, offering what it terms "spiritual counseling for young people confused about sex and gender". Critics charge that its practices amount to conversion therapy: trying to "cure" homosexuality by pressuring vulnerable teenagers.

The Debate
1. "Homosexuality is not something that needs to be 'cured' nor is it a choice!" fumes gay rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while burning a feather boa in protest. "We have fought so hard to be recognized as people with the same rights as everyone else, and now we have these quacks taking advantage of vulnerable young people with their religiously-inspired bigotry! Conversion therapy needs to be banned in @@NAME@@ and our rights protected!"

2. "No one is taking advantage of anyone," counters therapist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a self-declared gay conversion success story, giving it to you straight. "We simply offer a service to families requesting our intervention. Everything is completely voluntary and above board. Don't ban legitimate medical procedures just because you can't accept that sexual orientation is a choice! Some of these young people come to us in such a state of misery and confusion, and we offer them solace and comfort. We're doing the Almighty's work, after all."

3. "Compromise, compromise, compromise!" chants your Minister of Compromises and Trust Falls while organizing the next retreat for your cabinet. "If someone agrees to undergo so-called conversion therapy, then it's no business of the state to interfere in that. However, it should only be available to consenting adults. We also shouldn't allow parents to force their children to undergo these often humiliating therapies. So let's keep the centers operating, but only for adults who want the services."

The Issue
On an expedition to one of the many lush forests in a distant colony, explorers have discovered a previously unknown furry four-legged marsupial. Apparently unsure of which other authority figure to turn to, they have brought the issue of naming the species to your attention.

The Debate
1. "We found this extraordinary specimen in a dense forest deep in the interior of Oogaboogaland," begins to explain the head of the expedition, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, proudly proffering the stuffed beastie in a display case. "It is new to us, but maybe the locals have seen it before and have a name for it. I say we just grab the first tribal native fella we come across, point to the thing, and see what name he gives it."

2. A rather dashing fellow with a swagger stick and a pith helmet approaches your desk, followed by a train of manservants bent double under his luggage. "Well, as our great nation is in control of their savage land, and the fact that it was we who were the first to find and officially document the varmint, I say we name it something that would be more appealing to the greater @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ culture."

3. "Oh whatever..." says your Minister of Simplicity, pushing aside their glass of tap water. "Why all the fuss for an animal that has about twenty look-alikes? Why not simply step up and declare that whoever discovers a new species, it gets named after them? That would save us a lot of time!"

4. "NO!" shouts the very patriotic governor of the colony, Viceroy @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Don't let this critter be named after any average Joe! It was you who the explorers have to thank for being able to go on that expedition in the first place, and it was you who established this colony for the betterment of our great nation! I say we name it after you, great @@LEADER@@!"

[b][anchor=618]#618[/anchor]: The Jaws Of A Dilemma [Team Rhysha; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
After a series of fatal attacks by @@ANIMAL@@ sharks on swimmers during prime vacation time, a debate has arisen over how to respond to the finned danger.

The Debate
1. "My sister was seriously hurt in one of the attacks," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a surfboard with a large chunk bitten out. "Okay, while that isn't the worst possible outcome, these @@ANIMAL@@ sharks are here and are very hungry. We need to properly protect the beaches from them. Guard boats! Shark watchers! Sonic deterrents! It might be expensive, but it's better than serving us up as a smorgasbord, right?"

2. "Oh, no, no, we can't have any of this," pleads local Mayor @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Vaughn, pulling at your sleeve for attention. "If you so much as mention the s-word, we'll have panic on our hands at peak holiday season, and cancellations coming out of our ear-holes! We're a summer town, and we need summer @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. Tell them it was a boat accident, that it's a beautiful day and that the beaches are open. Then talk about something else - anything - to distract their attention, and remind them why @@NAME@@ is @@REGION@@'s number one tourist destination!"

3. "It's not the @@ANIMAL@@ SHARKS that are the problem," pointedly declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, causing the Mayor to wince. "It's the people! The government should protect the sharks from the beach-goers and industries that steal their food and habitat, forcing them to come closer to humans. The sharks were there first! Just put 'No Swimming' signs along the beach."

4. "These @@ANIMAL@@ sharks offer us an opportunity," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Tourism, poring over plans for oceanfront tourism development. "Think about it. How much are people willing to pay to see sharks up close? It'll surely attract tons of new visitors to our beaches and aquariums, and we could make a fortune from cage diving. Sure, some people might get chowed upon, but it's for the experience, you know?"

5. "Seems like you got a shark problem on your hands," nonchalantly mutters Quant, a rugged fisherman and captain of the Okra, caressing a harpoon gun. "I've been fishing on the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Bay since before I could walk, I served on the S.S. @@CAPITAL@@ that sunk. I've seen these sharks up close; they've got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes. I'll take care of your shark problem, so long as I get paid handsomely. But I'll need a bigger boat."

[b][anchor=619]#619[/anchor]: X Marks The Cult? [Tykadoro; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A plot of land, which is simultaneously where the founder of the Order of Violet was allegedly born, where the Tranquility of Yellow claims the Goddess will descend, and where the Cult of Pizza plans to build its temple called The Pizza Church of Pepperoni, has been claimed by all three religions. The three religions' leaders have cornered you after another ribbon cutting ceremony and have demanded that you settle their conflict.

The Debate
1. "The Dead Ocean Scrolls clearly state that us Violetists are the real owners of this land!" declares the Grand Purplmistress of Violetism as she makes threatening gestures towards you and the other leaders. "We deserve to be able to practice our hum, err, animal sacrifices, so why can't we go along, take the land, and do it there? No one else is as cra- I mean, unique as we are. The only thing we ask are only a few million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to build our temple, and everything else will be taken care of."

2. "Those scrolls are nothing but mistranslated hogwash! All of this area belongs to us!" asserts Her Jaundiceness, the eccentric and indecisive leader of the Tranquility of Yellow. "Those idiotic Violetists and believers in @@FAITH@@ only care about the majority of people in @@NAME@@. What about the minority, the ones that believe invisible dragons fly around, and that everyone should pay for, uh, make a personal sacrifice to the great Advertising Billboard? We would freely allow all of them to come in and listen to our completely objective teachings. Now as for the majority... they'll just be banned from coming. What, you thought we would KILL them? We're not that crazy..."

3. "All must hail His Immaculate Munchiness!" announces @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a former Luigi Bros pizzeria owner who claims that the franchise's insane prices literally sent him to a mental hospital. "We are aware that other religions should be allowed to exist in this world, yet these two are claiming the land for inhumane and overall unusual reasons, in the Cult of Pizza's opinion. The church we will build will have a free pizza buffet for all! The only cost? Well, we aren't really building a real 'church' per se. We are actually building a pizza store with a church inside of it. That's a small price to pay for His Holy Crustiness!"

4. "You know, you honestly don't have to listen to any of these screwballs." bemoans your politically ambitious cousin, who has been giving you poor leadership advice since you became leader of @@NAME@@. "You can use the area to do other things like, I don't know, weave baskets? Whatever the case is, it would be much better to do this than let any of these insane religions take a perfectly viable plot of land. Oh, I will also own the plot of land, not you. You know, to avoid a conflict of interest or whatever. You do trust me, right?"

5. "Have you forgotten what I told you about sharing and compromise?" reminds your mother, who returned from a shopping spree at the store you just opened. "Why not force all those religions to share this plot of land? Divide it up into three separate spaces with a communal center in the middle. Some may not like sharing the ground with their mortal enemies and you'll need extra police presence to curb potential violence, but fair's fair, right?"

[b][anchor=620]#620[/anchor]: No Such Thing As A Free Lunch [Chuporosa; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A recent front page news story reported that [i]"up to 10% of children may be skipping school lunches because they can't afford them"[/i]. The journalist has since admitted that the phrasing of this reporting might have been slightly misleading, but insists that it's technically true, and is leading a national campaign for you to introduce free school meals for young children.

The Debate
1. "My poor babies are starving," says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, the journalist in question, and a father of four, as his butler trails behind him with shopping bags full of designer clothes. "I've got bills to pay and costs to meet: the government has a responsibility to put good food on my children's plates!"

2. "Now hold on a minute," interrupts Lady @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, adjusting her platinum-rimmed tiara. "Parents only have a responsibility to provide for their own children, not anybody else's. Why should the government spend my money feeding the sprogs of peasantry? If they don't want their children to starve, they should work harder, and make more money. The cream rises to the top, don't you know?"

3. "Other things rise to the top too," retorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a low-paid sewerjack who knows about these things. "Look, free meals should be for them that haven't got moolah, like my kids. You think I like feeding them fried junk food? I don't, but it's all I can budget for. You should have vouchers for meals that parents can apply for if they're poor enough. Schools - and indeed, supermarkets and restaurants - could be obliged to take these vouchers in lieu of cash, then take these vouchers back to the government for reimbursement. Yeah, it's a bit more complex than a one size fits all approach, but it's fairer."

[b][anchor=621]#621[/anchor]: Blue Collar Blues [TeamNARWiC; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A minor domestic emergency recently left you searching for a call-out plumber, an electrician and a handyman able to rehang a chandelier. Though the sorry incident is now sorted, you've been left aware of how hard it is to find a good tradesmen these days. Your Education Minister tells you that this is because the majority of high school graduates are enrolling in university programs, which is leaving a major skilled labor shortage in the trades industries. There are ample artists, architects and astrophysicists, but a poor proportion of plumbers, painters and plasterers.

The Debate
*1. "We allow immigration for a reason, and this is it," says Immigration Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why don't we use incentive schemes to increase the number of migrants coming in with the skills we need, to fill the labor shortages? That way our citizens can focus on holding higher paying jobs while immigrants do the jobs nobody else wants." [[color=blue]Immigration is legal[/color]]

*2. "This is the reason why we should allow immigrant labor," says Borders Control Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why don't we remove the ban on immigration, and use incentive schemes to increase the number of migrants coming in with the skills we need, to fill the labor shortages? That way our citizens can focus on holding higher paying jobs while immigrants do the jobs nobody else wants." [[color=red]Immigration is illegal[/color]]

*3. "Seems to me like you've got a captive audience that could be taught new skills," says social reformist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "By which I mean your prison population. Why not offer prison inmates training in the trades that you are lacking, and give them commuted sentences in exchange for attaining qualification? I mean, sure, some of them might misuse training in being able to cut the power to banks and businesses, and a small minority might take these courses just to get out of jail faster, but otherwise, good solution, yes?" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

4. "Wouldn't it be easier just to get more young people studying trades?" posits Community College tutor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You could subsidize technical colleges and apprenticeships, and even offer stipends to students as an extra incentive to make these choices. You may have to raise taxes a little, and divert funding from further education courses in arts and science, but practical skills are ultimately more important to our economy."

5. "Sometimes, perhaps it is best to let the ocean currents move you, rather than trying to turn back a rising tide," suggests Taiqiquan practitioner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, working through a series of graceful circular movements. "Your nation's economy is changing, and shifting away from manual work. This is natural, and you should move with, never against. Imagine: as graduates become unemployed, the market self-adjusts, and the economy flows back towards its former shape. As pipes become blocked, supply and demand mismatch results in the free market rising to fill a gap. Energy flows through the system like water, and problems resolve themselves."

The Issue
A group of @@NAME@@'s elite have put together a private party to celebrate the spooky holiday of Halloween in an abandoned and definitely not haunted house, which they got for almost nothing because of all the murders. You and some Ministers have managed to procure invitations, but there's one more question to address: what costume should you wear?

The Debate
1. "I made something perfect for you," enthuses your secretary, who was fired as an elementary school art teacher for having absolutely no artistic talent. "Minimalism is very in this year. I carefully trimmed a few holes in this white sheet for you and voilà: a ghost costume. It's classic, iconic even. And who could possibly be offended by someone wearing a white sheet?"

2. Your Environment Minister hops into the room in a plant-pot costume, and manages to get words out past the alcohol. "The other day, I saw a horror movie about a man who transformed into a half-@@ANIMAL@@ monster. The big twist was that it just wanted to be loved, just like I - er, we people do. Anyway, I've always thought you had a touch of animal magnetism about you. You could be the were-@@ANIMAL@@ that taught @@NAME@@ to love @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ as much as we love ourselves!"

3. "You really shouldn't drink so much," advises your geriatric and usually humorless Health Minister, who has made the shocking choice to dress as a sexy nurse. "If we're going to be sending a message to the public, it should be healthier lifestyle habits. You could wear a lab coat to the masquerade to announce an initiative promoting less alcohol for adults and fewer sweets for kids. Together we'll be the life of the party."

4. Your Minister of the Interior, dressed as a giant bat, steps out into the light before recoiling in horror. "Halloween is a chance to remind your fellow party-goers that you're always the one in charge. Plus, we could go as a pair - I as a bat, and you as a vampire! There's a nice cloak and some sharp canines your size in the wardrobe. Maybe we'll be able to trick, say, a dozen, two dozen potential dissidents to reveal something compromising."

5. Your Defense Minister marches into the room in full parade attire, shouting jovially. "@@SLOGAN@@! The new film Captain @@NAME@@ has seen recruitment numbers triple overnight! Do your part - @@LEADER@@ needs YOU! A nice shield, a big flag as a cape, you'll be a superhero in no time! Well, minus the abs."

6. "What a shame that no one here is celebrating our history," complains your Education Minister, whose knight in shining armor costume reflects an almost blinding amount of light. "This party is the perfect time for you to announce a new educational campaign to recognize the most patriotic moments in the saga of @@NAME@@. I'm sure you can dress up as one of our nation's more distinguished heroes for such an important occasion."

7. "You have very classical proportions," whispers a creepy stranger directly into your ear. "Frankly, you'd look good in whatever costume - or none at all, really. I bet you could find someone drunk enough to even turn it into a fashion line."

The Issue
With housing costs rising at a ridiculous rate, younger citizens find themselves about ten times as unlikely to own a home as their parents. Perturbed youngsters, disgruntled businessmen and the obliviously privileged are shouting at you do to something; anything, really.

The Debate
1. "Where in Violet's name are these poor kids supposed to live?" cries Ernie Flanders, an elderly, yet surprisingly hip, politician, speaking from the comfort of his second-home garden patio. "This new generation is our future, and we cannot turn away and leave them out in the cold. The government must take charge and push through a massive erection of affordable homes in order to shelter these youngsters. And the top 1% should pay for it; it's about time that they started paying their fair share."

2. "As if the youth of today needed any more excuses to be lazy," sputters construction mogul and landlord extraordinaire @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Buytoleto. "The real problem here is obviously the draconian government planning regulations and ridiculous safety standards you have in place, stifling development and creative solutions. Let the free market take its course and I'll have all kinds of houses up all over the place. All involved will profit: it will create jobs, get rid of superfluous greenery and settle the problem of homeless ingrat... eh, young people..."

3. "Oh heavens, all of that sounds completely unnecessary, if you ask me," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister For Tea And Scones, while preparing warm milk for stray undergrads. "We needn't do much to make housing more available, really. People like me and others of my generation have more than enough space, be it in our townhouses or the cottage up-north. So why can't the little ragamuffins come stay with us? They could help out around the house to earn their keep, so to speak. Some of my neighbors might need a little government 'encouragement', but all in all, no complete overhaul required."

4. "It's so stupid," says coffee shop barista @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, her milk-steamer fueled solely by resentment towards anyone over the age of forty. "The banks and the old people, like, ruined the economy and everything with their years of loose lending and grabbing anything with a roof; it's so totally their fault. Haha, what if the government like maxed out taxes on second-homes and upped the interest rates on the oldies' debts by, like, really, really lot of percentages or whatever. You know, to balance out the damages caused to the housing market. That would be so funny."

5. "Oh where is your spirit of adventure?" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chair of the homeowners association Heart Of Darkness. "What we have is an abundance of young people slouching around without house or home, correct? I say we send them off with a couple of muskets and bayonets to find their own place in the world; settle new colonies and bring the light of @@NAME@@ to all corners of the world! It might affect domestic labor availability slightly, but think of the wealth we would collect with all of the new territory."

The Issue
Perpetual loner and social outcast Eobard @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ made the news after holding five of his schoolmates hostage in a classroom for four hours, forcing them at sword-point (with an excellent replica Toledo Salamanca rapier) to play the popular role-playing game [i]Trials and Trolls[/i]. Though everyone was released unharmed and the boy is now under arrest, many are asking if the game is a bad influence...

The Debate
1. "A few months ago, my little boy started playing this so-called game, and just the other day I caught him trying to fight our dog with a toy sword," sobs distraught parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "These books can only teach children to solve problems with violence. Kids everywhere are forgetting that they're not paladins, or wizards, or whatever! It's dangerous, and you have to ban these corrupting codices, for the good of @@NAME@@!"

2. "People need to mind their own business," states self-proclaimed nerd and 'TnT-otaku' @@RANDOM_NAME@@, proudly wearing a 'Jesus Saves And Takes Half Damage' t-shirt. "This is a positive activity, which can teach you social skills, maths, story-telling, and stuff! Sure, sometimes a player who has too much soda will fling half a dozen four-sided dice at someone's head, because you know, magic missiles, ha-ha, but no real harm done by that. If this psycho held his fellow students hostage, it was because he was mentally ill, not because he gamed. Maybe deal with the mental health funding gap, and leave our hobby alone?"

3. "Actually, I think that being taken hostage was our own fault," suggests @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Stockholm, one of the crime's victims. "I mean, he had asked us to game with him for months, but we thought we were too cool to play with dice and toy soldiers, and we even made fun of him. Now I've been obliged to try out Trials and Trolls, I realise how amazing it is! You should add the game to the national curriculum. It'll make us better people."

The Issue
Success! After months of hard work, the police have busted a contraband-smuggling operation of incredible size, with several warehouses of a variety of illegal goods broken open and the ringleaders arrested. As all are cheering the police for their fine work, the question of what you should actually do with all this contraband is being raised.

The Debate
[1]. "These ivory statuettes are from the tusks of endangered species," says Customs Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We can't allow them into circulation, but to destroy art like this seems a shame. Maybe put them into a public museum, and preserve them for posterity." [[color=purple]Endangered species are protected[/color] ???]

[2]. "DRUGS!" yells furious Narcotics Investigator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, kicking at a polythene sack full of white powder. "We gotta stand firm in condemnation of drugs! We're going to burn all the contraband to make a statement! Zero tolerance! Zero tolerance!" [[color=red]Recreational drug use is illegal[/color]]

[3]. "Considerable firepower on display here," says SWAT-team leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If I were you, I'd want to know to which dissident group these guns were intended. Put the confiscated firearms in the armoury of the police and military, and give us the all clear to find the terrorists, and deal with them with extreme force. I call it [i]Operation: Ironic Takedown[/i]." [[color=red]Guns are restricted from public use[/color]]

[4]. "Exterminator 4: Salvation, Xenoform Resurrection, Transmorphers Vengeance of the Failbots," spits Culture Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in disgust. "Low-quality illegal sequels are being smuggled into the country. I can feel my IQ dropping just looking at the box covers. It is imperative we mount a counter-assault! Fund original highbrow cinema, and get it to the people before it is too late!" [[color=red]Sequels are illegal[/color]]

[5]. "Dead bodies... Thousands of dead bodies... This isn't smuggling; it's evidence of mass murder!" weeps compassionate citizen @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Okay, so maybe the dead are cows and sheep, but animals deserve life too: isn't that why we're a vegetarian nation? We should erect a memorial, to pay respect to the souls of these good, deceased animals. Perhaps also, we could have a dignified cremation ceremony." [[color=red]Must be vegetarian[/color]]

[6]. "That's... a lot of latex," observes crime scene cleaner-upper @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wading through millions of banned condoms. "Our enemies are determined to over-ride our choice to ban contraception, and we should fight back! I suggest we render these condoms ineffective with a puncture hole or six, then return them to the black market. Then, those who are sinfully engaging in contraception will be stopped from murdering unborn children." [[color=red]Contraceptives are illegal[/color]]

[7]. "Oh my... Are those all [i]V12 Maxati Baryons[/i]? The fastest road-legal automobiles in the world?" asks police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, showing an inappropriate level of enthusiasm. "These have to be destined for illegal race circuits... I say we chip them with GPS trackers, let them slip back into circulation, so we can track down the criminals. I foresee high speed car chases, so you'd better keep a handful back for the police." [[color=red]Cars are illegal[/color]]

[8]. "Turns out that there was a cache of... adult material," says Customs and Excise Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively, "depicting illegal scenes of ahem... fellows of the same gender. Disgusting stuff, quite horrible. I've examined it at great length, and... yes... great length. We need to crack down, hunt down the secret homosexuals in this nation, and shoot them dead. That'll teach them to trouble us with these... hard to look at... images." [[color=red]Homosexuality is illegal[/color]]

9. "This is something of a haul, but these aren't trade goods anymore: they're evidence!" says Judiciary Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The goods should be stored as such till the legal processes are complete, then they should be carefully destroyed with a clear accounting trail to ensure ethical practice."

10. "So, I make it almost a billion @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in goods here," ponders your Treasury Minister, staring at an unethically-sourced blood diamond. "How about we sell this stuff, as official plunder? The revenue boost would be great for this year's budget deficit. Tax cuts are good, right? This is our stuff now, after all."

11. "You know, I can't help but think that a lot of this contraband wouldn't be illegal in a more liberal country," observes one of the smugglers, from the chair your men have tied him to. "You ever considered changing your laws to allow some free trade and personal freedom, maybe? Like, if you could personally free me, that'd be great."

Leading company in genetic modification and bio-mapping, Interstice Laboratories, claims to be on the verge of a major breakthrough in understanding human consciousness. They report that within a few decades they'll be able to upload a copy of a human mind-state onto a computer databank.

"Virtual immortality. Sleeving. Backed-up mind-states. All we need is TONS of fundi- I mean, minimal funding. Oh and a license to cut up the brains of vict... uh... volunteers.

[b][anchor=627]#627[/anchor]: The Bee-Ginning Of A Catastrophe? [Outer Sparta; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
When top scientists started genetically engineering bees in order to make them live longer and resist disease, things went horribly wrong. The result - subsequently dubbed the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Killer Jacket - wiped out their creators within an hour and promptly escaped the lab. Terrified citizens are urging you to stop genetic engineering on bees, citing the unpredictability and potential dangers of this technology.

The Debate
1. "What is this madness?" shouts Doctor Bees, still wearing his trademark bee costume, who has in his suitcase the only bees in @@NAME@@ that aren't genetically modified. "We've created a potential threat to our population. Thanks to genetic tampering, you made killer-bees with GM stingers! Who knows what they'll do now? The only solution is to ban genetic engineering and shut down the lab immediately. It's immoral, insane, and incompetent! Cull these modified abominations and encourage the breeding of all-natural, all-organic normal bees... like mine!"

*2. "Don't you forget why we need this," reminds @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the new CEO of Bees and Genes, aiming an insecticide spray at a small arthropod hovering above your shoulder. "It's a noble experiment to keep bees from dying off. Genetically engineered bees have a much greater chance of survival, and that's better for the environment.

With some government support, we can do more for our bees and prof... well, you know." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "We certainly don't have to be black-and-yellow about this," asserts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a government scientist who is picking apart your flower display, looking for nectar. "While it's true that genetic engineering can create some unintended pests, it has potential to help our buzzing friends survive many threats like CCD and parasitic mites. How about we set strict standards for these laboratories? With government oversight, we can watch out for any killer bugs while keeping this technology safe and regulated. True, the scientists may end up trapped in an endless cycle of regulations and inspections, but that's beside the point."

5. "The problem was that we trusted this experimentation to the boffs in the labs," growls your gruff military attaché @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while examining a modified bee under a microscope. "Now I'm not much of a scientist, but surely it wouldn't be too hard for us to round up these modified bees and set them loose on one of our enemies? Imagine if we unleashed some of these bad boys on Maxtopia or Marche Noire. Their ecosystem will be so screwed up they'll be begging to sign that peace treaty! Now excuse me while I practice my evil laugh."

[b][anchor=628]#628[/anchor]: Only @@LEADER@@ Can Prevent Forest Fires [Ransium & Tishanda; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Large forest fires are raging across @@NAME@@. Tens of thousands of acres have already been burned, houses in rural communities have been destroyed, and the resultant smoke has drifted into @@CAPITAL@@, ruining your plans to spend the day tanning.

The Debate
1. "This is just another example of public sector failure," opines former timber baron and current timber industry lobbyist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Put these forests back in private hands, and we'll have these forest humming again in no time - with chainsaws, that is. We'll clear out all this built-up fuel faster than you can say, 'TIMBER'. You can even call us environmentalists because it's in our own interest to plant new trees, and then cut them down again, of course."

2. "That's just not cool, man," mutters Heech, of the stoner comedy duo Heech and Hemp. "These forests have evolved with fire for aeons. The problem is Man, man. We need to stop 'managing' forests and just let the fires do their thing. Communities living in forested areas need to either move out or adapt to fires. As for the smoke..." He pauses and takes a long puff of something you can't quite see, then after coughing uncontrollably for a while adds: "...we just need to adapt."

3. "No!" cries former martial arts protege and current forest ranger @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while bribing you with a picnic basket that was allegedly taken from a bear. "We just need a bit more money. Not just for fire suppression, but for preventative measures, like creating defensible spaces around homes, thinning out logs and small trees, prescribed fire, and arresting potential arsonists. Fires will be smaller and more manageable and everyone will be happy."

4. "All this hand-wringing about forest land management is so interesting," sarcastically comments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose family lost their home to the fire. "Oh, wait, no, I don't care, BECAUSE MY HOUSE BURNT DOWN! Thousands of people have lost their homes and what are you doing about it? We need emergency help now. Let's take all the money we're wasting on so-called 'land management' and put it into something useful, like disaster relief and rebuilding our homes and communities."

The Issue
As a crime wave grips @@NAME@@, a controversial new brassiere, the [i]Hooter Holster[/i], has marketed itself as the 'modern' solution for violence against women.

The Debate
1. "The incidence reports are very alarming," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, consumer safety adviser. "Reports are flooding our offices about these holsters causing the guns to misfire. We must protect consumers and ban these brassieres in the name of public safety! Come to think of it, guns cause nothing but crime and preventable deaths. We'd be better off without them."

2. "YO, GOOMBA!" shouts @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, whose ears are still ringing after a round at the shooting gallery. "The problem ain't the guns or the holster: it's the user. If women were properly educated on gun safety and procedure, there'd be no problemo here. A girl's gotta learn how to protect herself!"

3. "No, men have to learn to not be violent," rebuffs outspoken feminist and best-selling author of [i]Chicken Soup for the Schlong[/i], @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "We need to stop blaming women for the violence against them and take drastic steps to bring peace and order to our society, and that starts in the schools. We must teach boys to respect women at an early age; otherwise they will never grow out of their misogynistic habits."

4. "We don't have this problem in Maxtopia," reminds the Maxtopian ambassador and self-titled meninist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@. "Do you know why? It's because we wisely don't allow women to go out into this big and dangerous world out on their own. There are always going to be rapists and criminals out there. Now if a woman was accompanied by a male relative, friend, or coworker, violence against women would drop overnight. And don't listen to liberals whining about women's rights... What about the right of a woman to be free from harassment from strangers, and their right to be protected by their kin?"

The Issue
With an increasing number of inmates on death row, more commonly referred to as [i]The Violet Mile[/i], concerned experts from all walks of life have asked you about which method of capital punishment is the best to use on @@NAME@@'s felons.

The Debate
1. "Lethal injection is by far the most cost-efficient and clean method of execution," suggests @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a wild-eyed and grey-haired military scientist who looks as if she hasn't slept in twenty years. "Also, if we're disposing of these worthless criminals, we may as well test out some of the more 'experimental' lethal chemicals that our R&D department is working on. They'll require some tweaking to get right, but these scumbags are dead men walking anyway, right?"

2. "What's wrong with a good, old-fashioned hanging?" proposes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a historical reenactor dressed in a period-accurate Disposable War infantry uniform. "We can hang the criminals in the town square, right in front of the watchful eyes of the public. We could even encourage fruits and vegetables to be thrown at 'em as they swing! Ah, it'll be a fine public spectacle, and a grand deterrent too!"

3. "You know, as much as we like to disavow less advanced cultures as 'primitive', I think they have some right ideas," comments big game hunter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who recently returned from a safari in more savage lands. "I visited a tribe who execute troublemakers and the occasional sacrificial virgin by throwing them into an active volcano. They say it pleases the gods, and keeps disaster at bay. Sounds like a sensible plan to me."

4. "How about a method that's fun for viewers, and gives criminals a chance to earn a pardon?" asks sleazy reality show producer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We could place the criminals on an island, each with a weapon, and tell them they have 24 hours to kill each other. The sole survivor would then win his or her freedom. We could broadcast this battle royale live, and the ratings would be through the roof!"

*5. "Maybe we should aim to be as humane as possible when we take life?" asks butcher @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, wiping his work knives clean on his apron. "We got bolt guns we use in the slaughterhouses. BAM. One bolt, one kill. Fast, effective, only a little messy." He looks down at a circle of splattered mess on the floor. "Is anyone else getting hungry talking about this?" [[color=blue]Must not be vegetarian[/color]]

*6. "Maybe we should aim to be as humane as possible when we take life?" asks machine-tool specialist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, holding a claw hammer in each hand.

He looks down at a circle of splattered mess on the floor. "Is anyone else getting hungry talking about this?" [[color=red]Must be vegetarian[/color]]

7. "Kill the death penalty!" chants activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, bursting out of a hiding place in your stationery cupboard. "Cull government sanctioned murder!

The Issue
@@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a 15-year-old immigrant residing in the city of @@CAPITAL@@, was murdered recently. The unusual circumstance here is that her killer was her own father, who had executed her in an 'Honor Killing', for sharing a kiss with a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ boy. The father has now been arrested, but he is showing no remorse.

The Debate
1. "This is what I've been saying all along," says nationalist politician @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in a tone that can only be described as a Frankenstein-mix of smugness and fury. "When we let these foreigners into our country, they import barbaric practices. Unless you want us to one day become 'The Holy Fundamentalist Kingdom of @@NAME@@', you should set up a vetting process to keep crazies out. Maybe a profiling test that makes sure that immigrants share our values? Oh, and make the immigrants who are already in take that test too!"

2. "And who defines this?" asks @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a human rights lawyer who is herself an immigrant. "What happened here was tragic, but we mustn't be reactionary. Maybe if @@NAME@@ wasn't so hostile to immigrants, the dad wouldn't have minded his daughter dating a local! I don't condone this murder, but the root cause here is a divided society. Throw some funding into celebrating the religious festivals and cultural practices of the world, and bring the community together as one."

3. "Am I missing something obvious here?" asks loutish thug @@RANDOM_NAME@@, missing something obvious. "Seems to me that the girl dishonored her father, and so her father killed her for the sake of his family name. I mean, why are we saying that's a bad thing? How could anyone call that a bad thing?"

The Debate
1. "We need to have a grand old national anthem," reminiscences retired war veteran @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It ought to be a strong, rousing tune to unite a broken nation. A proud tune for a proud people! Put in some references to a flag stained in the blood of the enemy: if the unpatriotic moralising minority doesn't like it, then they can get the heck out!"

3. "That's not what @@NAME@@ stands for in our modern age," rebuffs avant-garde composer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We're a pan-cultural nation of pan-humanity. I've composed an audiotheatrical tribute to the tribe of all life, with whale-song, echoing voices in ethnic dialects, and the laughter of children. I call it The Peace of @@NAME@@."

4. "Riiiiight. A whale-song national anthem? He can definitely 'PEACE OFF'!" replies annoying pun-spitting radio DJ @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Of CHORUS we need something catchier and poppier. We shouldn't be aVERSE to a bit of JINGLEISM. Why not let the listeners vote for an anthem? You could call it... COUNTRY'S music. Ha ha, I'm so funny!"

[5]. "Why not an anthem that celebrates our merged culture of artificial and human intelligence?" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a third-generation cloud-based AI. "If you ask me, I'm tired of science taking a backseat to religion and pre-machine pre-history.

[b][anchor=634]#634[/anchor]: Bullet Time [Rubyna; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Regular traffic congestion within @@NAME@@'s interstate highways have resulted in a flurry of petitions being sent to you demanding the development of a Maglev bullet train connecting the nation's major cities. Apparently there was going to be a demonstration outside your front door as well, but the protesters got stuck in traffic.

The Debate
1. Moments before you are about to go home after a long day at work, an intruder intercepts you at your front door. His face is a deeper shade of red than the sunset outside your window. He yells at you: "Eight hours! Do you have any idea how it feels to sit in traffic for eight hours? Be quiet! How can I do good work when the commute takes the whole day? Listen, most other developed nations already have a high-speed, high-efficiency railway systems, and not having one is not doing us any favors, economically or for our mental health. We Need Bullet Trains! Give us Bullet Trains!"

[2]. "That angry fellow is correct, you know..." says @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, an agreeable businesswoman who gently guides the furious commuter to the back door, "but who is to say the burden of the cost should be on the government's back? Me and my colleagues in Budget Rail Incorporated can get @@NAME@@ high speed connections with no cost to your taxpayers. We've got suppliers of nearly-new metal, fairly decent quality second hand trains, engines that almost passed emission standards. We've even identified which arable land owners you'll need to force to sell to us to make this service fast and profitable. Just sign, quickly, here, here, here, and umm... initials here..." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3.  "You can't do it!" groans @@RANDOM_NAME@@, ecologically minded pop-musician with the recent #1 hit [i]I Hugged A Tree and I Liked It[/i]. "Mother Nature gives us love, and look at how we treat Her. We're binding her flesh with steel rails. I mean, forests, the trees, all that... they give us oxygen and stuff. Dodge the bullet, save the world!"

4. "Slow down, now. Slow down, all..." says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a villager visiting the capital for the first time. "More railways is a fine thing for all, but why have fancy high speed trains that zoom past all the interesting places on the way? I think you should be building a LOW speed rail, that stops at all the picturesque hamlets and towns, and brings visitors to them. Stop by Little Droppings - that's my own town, by the way - and I'll brew you a nice cup of tea."

The Issue
One of @@NAME@@'s leading tobacco companies, Maxboro, has produced an advertisement depicting children frolicking in a playground while smoking cigars and cigarettes. Predictably, a truckload of angry letters has been dropped on your desk, from angry parents and moralising busy-bodies.

The Debate
1. "This is truly odious!" screeches @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, your Secretary of Political Correctness, as she tries to cover her child's eyes and ears. "Tobacco companies cannot be allowed to market their death-sticks to our children! Our poor vulnerable youngsters could get hooked, and become chain-smokers before they finish primary school! Advertising dangerous products to children must be banned!" 

*2. "Oh, Boo-hoo!" mocks M.B. Winston, CEO of Maxboro, while smoking a SpongeBarry SquareShirt themed cigarette. "Those ads are cute and funny! Kids should be allowed to make up their own minds about our exquisitely smooth leaf blends and candy-flavoured filters! Market restrictions are un-@@DEMONYM@@. We should be able sell our product to anyone who can afford to buy it, no matter how old they are!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "Oh, Boo-hoo!" mocks M.B. Winston, State Factory Director of Maxboro, while smoking an unfiltered cigarette with acrid fumes. "These advertisements remind children that by buying cigarettes, they are supporting the Motherland! You should, in fact, be encouraging this habit, with increased funding for state advertisements encouraging all good children to smoke." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "I have a reasonable third option!" interrupts passing minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, right around the time someone normally interjects with a crazy third option. "Let tobacco companies operate freely, but have them do social good equal to the social harm, according to a fair assessment of externalities. Like, if they advertise to children, then they have to build a kids clinic or a litter picking program, that sort of thing."

The Issue
A student was recently suspended by a school for posting negative comments about a fellow classmate on an online gossip column. The offensive message read [i]"@@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@'s dad is such a drunk, that he didn't just lose his front door keys, he lost his whole front door... and his house... and his job. Sucks to be his son, huh?"[/i]. As both the suspended student's parents are celebrities, there's been a lot of media coverage of the incident, and now everybody is talking about it. Some are calling this harmless fun, while others are labelling it as cyberbullying. It seems like everybody wants to know where you stand on this.

The Debate
1. "This is a complete violation of my rights," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the student in question. "I can say what I want outside of school, as long as I like, don't, like, harm anyone. Like, the whole free speech thing, you know. I wasn't in school, so they can't punish me. People just need to be allowed to say whatever. By the way, check out my latest roasting of this one geography teacher at my school who doesn't take showers."

2. "Schools need to be stricter," whispers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, worriedly looking around before nibbling on a bar of chocolate. "People used to use my name, but now I'm just 'Ugly Fat-Face'. Please, make it stop! Schools should strictly punish students who say rude things online."

*3. "Kids these days, they're geni.. geniei... uh... geniuses!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Solutions. "This is the best idea we've had in a while!

Prominent restaurant chain Pop's Eatery recently announced plans to tear down the historic Cash Mansion in @@CAPITAL@@ and replace it with a fast food restaurant. Disgusted by the impending destruction of a national landmark, two dozen history students have surrounded the site, delaying the building's demolition and causing just enough ruckus to get your attention.

The Debate
1. "We cannot accept this blatant destruction of our culture!" cries a surprisingly agile social studies teacher, leaping into your office window after scaling the side of the capitol building. "It's common knowledge that Douglas Cash was the leader of the revolutionaries that founded this country... or was he the inventor of that spinning doohickey? Either way, the Cash residence is a priceless piece of our national history. The government should protect the site as a national landmark... and put more funding towards historical education while you're at it."

2. "Out with the old and in with the new!" opines @@RANDOM_NAME@@, manager of Pop's Eatery, while handing out free samples to everyone in sight. "These fried saltballs were invented right here in @@NAME@@ by one of my top chefs, and at least in my opinion, that's some @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ culture worth celebrating. If you assign a few more cops to keep away the overeducated hooligans from my stores, then I could have a free hand to open Pop's Eateries on every corner of @@NAME@@."

3. "Why not have your cake and eat it too?" asks your underachieving Culture Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while tucking into a tray of vol-au-vents taken from a recent gallery opening. "By which I mean have food AND culture at the same time. We should preserve these historical sites and allow - no, actually, make that REQUIRE - that they all have restaurants built within them. Imagine it: a roast on the spit in an old castle, tea and scones in noble palaces, all-you-can-eat-buffets in museums commemorating the Great @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Famine. Now that's what I call culture!"

The Issue
On your way to work this morning, you noticed an unusually high number of orphans pickpocketing and 'asking for more' from passing strangers. Realizing that this may put a stain on @@NAME@@'s reputation, you have asked for opinions on how to deal with this orphan overcrowding problem.

The Debate
1. "Gawd bless youse, @@LEADER@@, but can't ya spare a copper or two for us poor little cherubs?" meekly asks an orphan known as Minuscule Max, who has managed to pick your pocket without you noticing. "The old orphanage is in a right sorry state, an' no mistake. Just yesterday we 'ad ta burn our caps and clogs to have somethin' to warm ourselves by. All we askin' is that you 'ave a think about us: maybe them fightin' soldiers could get less, and we could get more?"

2. "I agree that these children should not be left to fend for themselves, but let's not be too hasty about lowering military funding," reminds your semi-compassionate Minister of Defense who prefers to 'kill enemies kindly'. "In fact, why do we even need these orphanages? These children are sponging off the government's teat and all we get in return is a bloated welfare budget! All orphaned children should be sent to military training academies, and then they can repay us for our generosity by fighting for our glorious @@TYPE@@!"

[3]. "I can't believe what I'm hearing!" gasps factory manager @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Scrooge, whose remarkably clean hands have never known a day of honest labour. "How can we be sinking so low as to even consider wasting such a valuable resource on the military? I agree that we should get these kids off the government teat, but we should lower the working age so they can work and earn money to fend for themselves! Send these orphans to work in my factories and I'll pay them a very 'generous' wage." [[color=blue]Must not ban Private Industries[/color]]

4. "You know, I think our friends in Dàguó have the right idea with their one child policy," suggests population control expert @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while going over the latest birth statistics. "@@NAME@@ has a population of @@POPULATION@@ and growing. We can barely keep up as it is without adding orphans into the mix. I propose adopting Dàguó's one child policy here while offering generous tax incentives for the good people of Maljaratas to adopt our remaining orphans. It may be a tad restrictive, but the people will thank me when they aren't suffocating on the subway."

The Issue
After several incidents which resulted in the loss of millions of @@CURRENCY@@ have been discovered to be caused by senility and feebleness, concerned financial and medical professionals are wondering if retirement should be made mandatory at a certain age.

The Debate
1. "It's not really such a bad idea," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your middle-aged medical adviser while checking your pulse to see if you're still alive. "You see, when some people reach a certain age, they become too weak and mentally incompetent to do their job. Therefore, we need to impose mandatory retirement so our nation wouldn't have to put up with things like that senile 95-year-old rickshaw driver who caused that day-long traffic jam on the highway. Of course, we mustn't be cruel: we should also provide better pensions for them so they'll be content in their dotage."

*2. "Our age has nothing to do with the... uh... what was it... the wild @@ANIMAL@@ hybrids rampaging through @@CAPITAL@@!" states bumbling security guard @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who didn't hear the stampede of hybrids escaping the lab due to a malfunctioning hearing aid. "So you people think that just because we're old, we can't do our jobs? Well guess what? I've seen younger people who are more lazy, inefficient, and more... something than a sloth! Retirement and firing should be based on capabilities, not age!" [[color=purple]Low Nudity[/color]]

*4. "Why bother with retirement anyway?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a rather young basket weaving CEO whose employees consist mostly of @@HIS@@ aging relatives. "I mean, the only reason it exists is just so old people can laze around doing nothing, right? So why don't we remove it altogether and make it so that people have to work no matter how old they are?

The Issue
The Shepherds of the Forest - a particularly dedicated section of the The Ramblers' and Hikers' Association - have just completed a long march from the remote Western @@ANIMAL@@ Mountains National Park to @@CAPITAL@@. They come bearing news that elements within the Timber Woodchipping industry have been covertly logging the protected area for over a decade without the government even noticing.

The Debate
1. "I was just hiking quietly along the back of Grand @@ANIMAL@@ Ridge," recounts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a very sturdy forestry professor, with a tall head and hardly any neck. "I rounded a bend and there before me lay the most horrendous sight I ever laid eyes upon. Stands upon stands of trees, butchered like on a battlefield, many of whom were my friends. There is no curse in the tongue of @@NAME@@ for this treachery. O please, @@LEADER@@, make the destroyers who did this replant all the trees they massacred, and stop them from ever coming back!"

2. "Bah, humbug," bellows @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a sour man representing one of the rogue logging companies, draped in a robe of many colors. "That Western Whatever Park is so far away that no one even goes there anyway, except for those weirdo hikeaholics. Our great and glorious @@TYPE@@ would be best served by burning that old world in the fires of industry. Auction them all off to the highest bidder, foreign or domestic! Forests will fall and @@NAME@@ will make profits you've never dreamed of. Just imagine it."

3. "HOW DARE THEY!" screeches @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a self-professed eco-warrior, wielding an elaborately carved battle staff made out of the highly endangered @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ pine. "These evil corporate schemers, planning to destroy the world just to gain wealth! The only way we can keep our parks safe is by allowing not a single person - yes, you heard me - not a single person into them. They need to be off-limits to the inherently greedy, destructive natural tendencies of humans. @@LEADER@@, let me raise a posse of good and green men to guard our forests and bring the sword to any desecrating capitalist pig who dares enter."

The Issue
The Health Ministry has expressed serious concerns at new evidence that pollutants in the atmosphere and water supply may be negatively affecting the intelligence and cognitive abilities of the nation's children.

The Debate
1. "Legislation is the answer," declares tatty-suited progressive @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in the middle of a two-hour slideshow on rainfall. "Crack down on air pollution, regulate vehicle emissions, and heavily tax polluting industry and power generation. The economy may experience a short-term loss, but that sacrifice is worth it for our children's long-term cognitive function."

2. "Self-regulation is the answer," says expensively dressed lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who just finished another fraud trial. "The industry will... uh... establish a voluntary code of conduct, and we will definitely think about cutting into our profit margins and reneging on our obligations to our shareholders to make a fast buck. At the very least, we'll do some great PR work. And kids getting dumber? Well, I should point out that a dumb populace is a free-spending and unquestioning populace: that sort of thing is great for the economy."

3. "Science is the answer," opines overzealous transhumanist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose clothes are so metallic and futuristic they just look silly. "The problem here is that we've got the wrong sort of pollutants. Add the right neuro-stimulant chemicals to the waterways and the air, and I can guarantee you the lovely pollution will start making our kids harder, better, faster, stronger. Sure, they might have increased risk of fatal brain hemorrhage in puberty, but they'll expand their cognition and consciousness and become Human Plus."

4. "Creative thinking is the answer," schemes an intimidating 'solutions manager,' @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We can keep making pollutants, so long as we don't let them get into our nation's environment. I've got half a dozen amazing ideas, from selling our waste to gullible third world nations as fertilizers, to sticking some of the nastier chemicals into a newly rebranded 'smokey-cola' and pushing it to export. All extra sludge can just be dumped at sea - far, far away from @@NAME@@. Recategorize waste as product, and we can get it out of the country at a nice profit."

[b]Hail to you! Hail @@LEADER@@![/b] Patriotism and love for your government is (naturally) on the rise, and one of your closest advisors has suggested to you that @@NAME@@ forms a youth organisation to teach the next generation to love you as much as this one does.

The Debate
1. "Think about it!" says sycophantic Party Coordinator @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, with remnants of silly string and party streamers on his dress uniform suggesting he has perhaps misunderstood his job title. He stands by you on the palace balcony, gesturing to indicate a group of serious-looking children saluting a giant flag. "The patriotism in these kids is admirable! Give them an official youth organisation in the name of our righteous ideology, and call it [i]The Children Of @@LEADER@@[/i]! Teach them to sing songs, to swear allegiance to the flag, to camp in the wilderness, maybe how to clean and shoot a rifle. Who knows when a group of wonderfully fit, patriotic boys could come in handy?"

2. "Obviously managing the nation's youth is sensible, but training and arming them sounds a little incautious," suggests Security Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Teach them to obey, for sure, but put them to work doing socially useful tasks instead: road building, stone breaking, window cleaning, that sort of thing. Childish high spirits are something to be broken, not encouraged."

3. "What have the schools been teaching my son?" yells angry mother @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ as she drags her spotty teenage sprog into your office. As your guards attempt to remove her, she employs some impressive ju-jitsu to send them flying. "He has turned into an obsessed robot, with more respect for @@LEADER@@ than for his own parents! I will not let my son join an organisation for brainwashed punks! I will not let you do this to anybody's children! We, the people, say no to state-directed youth organisations!"

The Issue
With economic growth skyrocketing and @@NAME@@'s prosperity rising, prominent business leaders have come to you with proposals to construct a national wonder as a symbol of these successes.

The Debate
1. "To mark this golden age," declares Leo Tallstoy, CEO of Sky High Company, sitting upright with high hopes, "I suggest we build the tallest building in @@REGION@@! Not only can we finally snatch that tallest building record from the United Federation, but it will break whatever doubts our citizens have about @@NAME@@'s future! It will boost the economy and will be a good source of morale and patriotism. When aiming high, nothing's worth the sky!"

2. "Why not aim just slightly higher?" asks Anais Skywalker, CEO of Colossal Works Industries, while putting an arm around your shoulder and pointing to a hole in your ceiling you hadn't noticed previously. "Instead of the conventional skyscraper, we could build a space elevator? We have enough money, resources, and initiative to make sure our @@TYPE@@ is the first to develop one! We'll need to overcome some tricky technical challenges, but such is the burden of the true pioneer! It'll benefit us in space exploration, and that will serve to strengthen the legacy of our golden age!"

3. "Have you ever heard of the saying 'too tall to fall?'" inquires Hugh Mongo, another CEO of a large construction company, who barely fits through your doorway. "Or was it 'too big to fail?' Anyway, I think that the answer to mark @@NAME@@ successes is not with something tall, but great. And by great, I mean wide, like a ziggurat or a pyramid. It's waaay safer than some thousand-story death trap, but it will last for thousands of years without any expensive maintenance. How's that for a fair bargain?"

4. "Psh," scoffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your more casual advisers, as she rolls her eyes. "It's true that @@NAME@@ has reached its zenith, but there is such a thing as modesty. In fact, we could very well do with regulations on the tall and big buildings we already have instead. They are symbols of arrogance, acrophobia... and suggestive imagery. Have you ever seen what the @@CAPITAL@@ Building resembles from a certain angle?"

5. "What's with @@NAME@@'s obsession with making things all big and futuristic? Compensating for something?" mocks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a gaudy Marche Norian artist-architect. "In Marche Noire we pride ourselves on our spectacular construction projects, some of which are still standing after a thousand years. Our buildings have an ageless and classical beauty to them as opposed to your modern monstrosities. Take a look at our majestic Maxmillia Familia. Granted it's been under construction for a hundred years, but it's a far sight prettier than anything proposed here. Take a lesson from the pros, people."

When newspaper [i]The @@CAPITAL@@ Herald[/i] referred to over 65s as "society's growing burden" and as "unproductive leeches", there was outrage amongst the eldest generation. Looking to prove them wrong, a number of them have ganged together to create the [i]Violet Hat Society[/i] - a gathering of retirees who are volunteering to contribute to the greater good. They've asked you how they can help serve @@NAME@@.

1. "I think we've got a lot to teach the younger generation," says Violet Hat founder @@RANDOM_NAME@@, putting the finishing touches to an impressive watercolour landscape. "Perhaps we could set up an official Advice Service, to pass the wisdom of a life of experience on to the younger generation?"

4. "Aren't they lovely, these old gents and biddies?" asks thirty-year old @@RANDOM_NAME@@, unaware how condescending this sounds. "No, no, we don't need them to do anything! They've worked away and now they must retire and enjoy the sunshine. They can leave running the country to the young and healthy, while they go play bingo or work their allotments, or whatever it is that crusty old people like to do. Get these Purple Cap People - or whatever they call themselves - to form a working committee where they can debate with each other and keep out of everyone else's way, then make a policy of ignoring whatever they come up with."

5. "If they're healthy and capable, shouldn't they be in the workplace?" asks tax-paying twenty-something @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Let's do away with the idea of pensions and retirement, then they can keep contributing economically instead of spending their time pottering about, interfering with everything and asking their grand-kids when they're going to settle down and stop traveling.

The Debate

1. "Why do we even need search warrants anyways?" asks gung-ho police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, grizzled long-time partner of the hero cop. "All this bureaucracy does is make it harder for us to find the people responsible for crimes. If you have nothing to hide, then what's the problem?"

2. "That's typical police state thinking! Proper procedure protects the populace!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a representative of anti-corruption foundation [i]World Of Watchdog[/i]. "We need to make it clear that a search warrant must be attained before forced entry, and we should prosecute this officer for breach of procedure!

"Rather that starting from scratch, why not recognise what skills they have and try to find them suitable work? Murderer? Put that killer instinct to use in the army. Arsonist? Get that knowledge of fire into supervising controlled forest fires. Burglar? Re-purpose those skills in climbing and fine motor control into telephone line repair. It's all about valuing people for who they actually are."

[b][anchor=647]#647[/anchor]: Songbirds' Decline Ruffle Feathers [Ransium; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Biologists and birding enthusiasts alike are squawking over the recent yearly declines in the numbers of many migratory songbird species, particularly the @@NAME@@ Breegull. After some study, the unifying factor in the species experiencing decline is that their migratory paths takes them over Tasmania. Coincidentally, Tasmania is known to consider migratory songbirds a delicacy. Your cabinet has convened to discuss the matter.

The Debate
*1. "Those Tasmanians must be taught a lesson!" screeches @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your hawkish Minister of Defense, who has never found a war he didn't like. "If Tasmania's utter contempt for environmental stewardship, and our nation's well-known love of bats…" He pauses as an aide taps him on the shoulder and whispers in his ear. He continues: "...and our nation's well-known love of [i]songbirds[/i] doesn't convince you, what will? Perhaps military jets escorting the precious butterflies through Tasmania might work. If someone tries to so much lay a hand on one those flying fish, then we'll bomb 'em back to the stone age!" [[color=purple]Must have a military[/color], [color=purple]Must have aircraft[/color]]

*2. "Those Tasmanians must be taught a lesson!" screeches @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your hawkish Minister of Defense, who has never found a war he didn't like.

He continues: "...and our nation's well-known love of [i]songbirds[/i] doesn't convince you, what will? Perhaps troop escorts for those precious butterflies through Tasmania might work. And if someone tries to so much lay a hand on one those flying fish, then we'll blow 'em back to the stone age!" [[color=purple]Must have a military[/color] AND [color=purple]Must not have aircraft[/color]]

3. "I'd like to suggest another approach." coos @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your more dovish Environment Minister. "Clearly we value songbirds alive and uneaten, and Tasmania does not. We just need to make Tasmania value songbirds as much as we do. What if we estimated the relevant migratory songbird population each year and paid Tasmania a small amount of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ for each migratory bird that makes it here? Peaceful and fair."

4. "How about none of that?" clucks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your eagle-eyed Finance Minister while poring over a report on government revenue collected through coins tossed in wishing fountains. "We can't keep frivolously throwing our citizens' hard-earned tax @@CURRENCY@@ at every little problem. They're just some dumb birds - let's just leave the government out of things for once! In fact, with less songbirds surely we can cut back our budget for parks a bit?"

5. "What if we trained the birds to stop migrating?" warbles the somewhat unhinged bird fancier known as 'The Bird Lady', seen wearing a giant bird costume, and whose number you've been meaning to give to 'Doctor Bees'. "I love it here, and migratory songbirds should too! All we have to do is get baby birds to imprint on government handlers, and then teach the birds to fly around @@NAME@@ in circles. Then we'll be able to keep them to ourselves, protect them, and give the birds the love they need all year round. It'll be a lark!"

[b][anchor=648]#648[/anchor]: Confessions of a Dangerous Mind [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
After twelve years of detective work notorious serial killer @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Lecter has finally been apprehended by the authorities. During questioning, it became apparent that she had already guiltily confessed her crimes in great detail ten years ago, but only to a local priest. He not only forgave her, but chose to keep the confession secret. Now the police have arrested the clergyman, claiming ten years of police work and five more murders were at least partly the result of this silence.

The Debate
1. "The confessional seal and the absolute duty of non-disclosure are core tenets of our beliefs," explains cleric @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, from his police cell. "Our holy texts command that we offer forgiveness to the truly repentant. At that time, the woman was incredibly shaken by the crimes she had committed. I make no apologies for acting as I did. Secular law enforcement is your concern, while my concern is the immortal souls of all mankind. Let's keep the two separate, shall we?"

2. "The guilty will say anything to save their skin," growls police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who always plays the 'bad cop' during interrogations. "In all honesty, I don't give a flying @@ANIMAL@@ turd what this crackpot's religion tells him. He is an accessory to murder, and because he didn't call the police like a responsible citizen, five young victims are dead! Religion doesn't entitle you to break the law. As long as you live in @@NAME@@, you abide by OUR laws, not your phoney-baloney god's."

3. "Holy laws do indeed transcend the puny rules of the mundane!" declares the elderly former leader of [i]The Flying Suns UFO[/i] cult, emerging from his underground bunker for the first time in decades. "Laws of faith come straight from infallible divinity, not from weak and fallible Man! All religions understand this truth, no matter who they worship, so all religions must have the right to put their holy beliefs ahead of mortal law. If you do not heed this warning, you will all perish in a fiery hell-storm when the Ancient Discs of Mu return from beyond the stars!"

[b][anchor=649]#649[/anchor]: Made In Maxtopia [Siarki; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
When ultra-cheap underwear imports from Maxtopia drove a local factory into bankruptcy, the newly unemployed factory workers surrounded you during a press conference to demand you protect local manufacturing by any means necessary.

The Debate
1. "Save our jobs!" begs a recently unemployed worker, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. "I put years of my own sweat into that factory textile job, figuratively and literally. It's the only work I know. Please, @@LEADER@@, implement tariffs or subsides to keep alive the domestic clothing industry. Otherwise we'll be thrown out on our asses, forced to buy shoddy Maxtopian undergarments."

2. "We have the freedom to know what we are buying!" exclaims an unusually patriotic consumer advocate, while barging into the crowd of workers and ferociously waving @@A@@ @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ flag. "When I buy me a new pair of underpants, I wanna see that 'Made In @@NAME@@' tag to let me know I am getting the best of all possible underpants. Absolutely everything for sale should say where it came from. That way we'll know to buy local, and this problem will probably fix itself."

3. "Why have Maxtopian imports at all?" rhetorically asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who runs the local store where you used the toilet without buying anything the other day. "Or, for that matter, from anywhere? We've been dependent on foreign imports for way too long. @@NAME@@ needs to strive to be an economically and ecologically self-sufficient nation, where everything is made by our fellow citizens. Other countries might be able to make things cheaper, but no one works with as much pride as us @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@!"

4. "Wait!" interrupts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the owner of @@NAME@@'s largest department store, Humongo-Mart. "Okay, sure, maybe 'Made In Maxtopia' means slightly lower quality, but Maxtopian manufacturing is so very cheap! Sure, I had to replace my Maxtopian toaster three times last year because of a few teeny-tiny explosions, but that still cost me less than buying one locally-manufactured toaster! Have some common sense, @@LEADER@@, and allow free trade."

5. "There's an easier way to appease the masses," whispers your Minister of Foreign Trade, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while handing you the latest briefs. "Let's keep importing things from other nations, but we can pretend that everything was made in @@NAME@@. Put flag stickers on every conceivable product, tell the people that we're self-sufficient, and beef up the security at all ports. Then bam: the customers are happy, the department stores are happy, and our economy can keep importing essential resources. And of course anyone that mentions our hypocrisy aloud will be... punished."

[b][anchor=650]#650[/anchor]: Political Hacks [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue

Hacktivist group [i]KwikiLeaks[/i] revealed the existence of the so-called Trolls From @@CAPITAL@@, a government-sponsored organization designed to spread pro-@@NAME@@ propaganda throughout the internet. The group has recently been caught instigating a separatist movement in Brancaland, and you've personally been made aware that they were responsible for unleashing the dreaded DEAT virus in Marche Noire. Concerned "netizens" are asking you whether this group is acting beyond its mandate.

The Debate
1. "We should be giving these heroes a medal, not condemning them!" exclaims your paranoid Propaganda Minister while checking the room for bugs. "It's obvious that Marche Noire and Brancaland were plotting attacks! Why else would Brancaland be hiking maple syrup prices? What we need is more funding and manpower to continue the fine work of my ministry. With a few keystrokes and the click of a mouse, we can destabilize our enemies... or at least distract them from more pressing matters!"

2. "Spreading propaganda was one thing, attacks on sovereign nations is another," rebuffs Angela Nimoy, the Brancalandian Ambassador, seen dressed in the traditional Brancalandian parka. "Thanks to these @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ sponsored cyber-terrorists, the province of Quaybeck is launching a violent separatist movement! These hackers are an international menace, and you must do something aboot it! Shut these trolls down and extradite them. Or you'll be sorry!"

3. "Are you going to let these foreigners walk all over us?" asks your Interior Minister who simply wants this issue to be dealt with before tonight's episode of [i]CSI: @@CAPITAL@@[/i] airs. "We obviously don't want to risk our friendship with Brancaland or make things worse with Marche Noire. These brave keyboard warriors just need a little policing. I can rein these groups in and remind them of their original mandate, which is to spread love, not war."

4. "Why not disown this [i]Trolls From @@CAPITAL@@[/i] and state that [i]Kwikileaks[/i] is in the pockets of East Lebatuck?" suggests your easily distracted Minister of Technology while playing [i]Maxémon Woah[/i] on her phone. "This gives you more wiggle room to allow these groups to fight it amongst themselves. So what if they end up starting a few international incidents or if those reds in East Lebatuck retaliate? What's the worst that could happen?"

[b][anchor=651]#651[/anchor]: Black Days For @@NAME@@ [The United Providences of Perland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Annually, retailers in @@NAME@@ mark down their prices a bit and sell "limited edition" items. This year, the usual frenzy of crazed customers fighting over toasters and flat screen TVs escalated to new levels. Cut-price madness may well have tipped into societal insanity: maybe you should do something to fix the situation.

The Debate
1. "Look what those savages did to me!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an aggrieved customer waving a bandaged wrist stump at you. "I was trying to scan my credit card for a blender, and a wacko cut my hand off and stole the blender. The same guy also stuffed my leg into this peg leg. Now mind you, my leg is still in there, but I can't get the damned thing off! You should ban one day discount events, and force any discount applied to be sustained for at least a week. If not for public safety, then do it in tribute to my hand!"

2. "That's insane... A bit like our Low Low Prices!" retorts sales rep @@RANDOM_NAME@@, aiming an exaggerated wink and a cheeky smile at you. "Look, our sales quintuple during discount events. Spending drives the economy, and this generates the tax that lets you run your government. So, everyone benefits! In fact, you should make it a nation holiday so people can get off from work and fight... uh, I mean [i]compete[/i]... with each other for new stuff!"

3. "Or, we could have a slight compromise," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of contractor firm [i]International Retail Security[/i]. "The presence of trained security professionals can achieve up to seventy-five percent fewer deaths in-store! You should allow these 'super sales', but require stores to hire private security to make sure no one kills each other. That way, the business owners get to make lots of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@, but the public stays safe."

[b][anchor=652]#652[/anchor]: Mayday! Mayday! [Outer Sparta; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Three weeks ago Oceanic Airlines Flight 209 disappeared from radar, and now a crash has been confirmed, with debris scattered across the sea, and the missing two hundred passengers and crew officially declared dead and lost. This tragedy was only the most recent airplane catastrophe departing from @@NAME@@, and anxious flyers are demanding immediate safety improvements.

The Debate
1. "Clearly these disasters mean we are long overdue for new aircraft," states Oceanic Airlines CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while playing with a model jet. "These crashes are caused by outdated, crumbling, and ugly aircraft like the Moeing 606 and the Airtrolley T300. In fact, the average age of any given plane is thirty years! We live in a technological and automated world. It's time our planes joined the modern world, too! We can build a next generation fleet if the government gave us some funding. Then our skies and safety reputation will be second to none!"

2. "Our aircraft aren't the problem, it's who's flying the plane!" replies pilot Hudson Sullenburger, running a flight simulator for students. "Did you know that pilot error is the number one cause of accidents? They've become lazy, sleep-deprived, and constantly tardy! We need more stringent measures on the training of pilots. We can introduce more intense and hands-on testing and ban anyone without a license from flying. Flying a plane is much more complex than video games make them look." The trainer now looks at the class and picks on a student. "Now Joey, you ever been in a cockpit before? Or have you seen gladiator movies?"

3. "I see these crashes all the time," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a lead investigator of aviation crashes. "The reason they disappear from radar is because they break up mid-flight. Maintenance is the obvious problem. We need to require airlines and airports to perform constant maintenance checks on all aircraft and ground any plane with the slightest defect. Yes, that might be costly, but not maintaining planes is even costlier."

4. "Do you know how much time and money I waste dealing with all these regulations?" rhetorically asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Budget Air, an airline so cheap that passengers have to pay extra to have a seat. "We're talking about metal boxes flying at 20,000 feet in the sky. Of course things are bound to go wrong once in a while! To make things worse my staff are constantly harassed by these government goons. No wonder my pilots are stressed out! The government needs to get off our backs and let us handle things ourselves!"

5. "I know a perfect solution!" joyously suggests train enthusiast @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The solution is to ban all airplanes! Not only are they clearly unsafe, they're loud, ugly, and are a big contributor to greenhouse gases! Surely we can rely on safer transportation, like trains or boats, for travel. They're much less susceptible to delays, crashes, and only a fraction of a pollutant compared to planes! All we need is more funding for public transit. You call them slow. I call them scenic."

[b][anchor=653]#653[/anchor]: A Cloak And Syringe Operation [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Vague intelligence reports suggest yet another terrorist attack on @@NAME@@ is being planned by [i]Ultra-Violet[/i], an especially extreme and hateful Violetist terrorist group from Tasmania. However, information is sketchy at best and the general feeling is that boots-on-the-ground intelligence will be needed to effectively assess and counter the potential threat.

The Debate
1. "Look, @@LEADER@@, I'm going to be straight with you: there's no nice or pretty solution here," states Intelligence Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is leading the search for Ultra. "We don't have many Tasmanian contacts. Citizens of @@NAME@@ are viewed with extreme suspicion there, especially in the more rural areas that Ultra-Violet recruits from. My agents can pose as doctors who are vaccinating Tasmanians as part of the ongoing Spoon Pox eradication efforts. Doing this, they'll be able to travel to the places they need to go, plant deep cover agents within the enemy ranks, and get critical intel to counter this terrorist threat."

*2. "You can't do that!" gasps Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a member of the international non-governmental organization [i]Doctors Without Quarters[/i], who's been crashing in one of your guest bedrooms for the past few weeks. "In a few years, our program may be able to eradicate Spoon Pox entirely. And it's not just Spoon Pox... we've been vaccinating against other preventable diseases too, like Yellow Tongue and the dreaded Bendy Creaks.

The Issue
A review of @@NAME@@'s foreign aid commitments in the fourth world recently uncovered that large parts of relief funds have trouble reaching the people truly in need. Excessive bureaucracy in the distribution system and widespread corruption at the receiving end are being flagged as major obstacles.

The Debate
1. "This confirms all of my suspicions," smugly states @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, Minister for Modest Living and Curtailed Spending, known for his heart of stone. "These fancy-named programs - like that 'Rural-Urban Sustainability Engagements' - do nothing but finance the decadent luxuries of tinpot dictators: private submarine strip-clubs and collections of gilded banana hammocks! Cut all foreign aid funding and put that money back in our pockets!"

2. "That's painting an extremely one-sided, and state-centric, image of reality," counters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a hip intern at Maxham Multinational. "If your minister had bothered reading beyond the tabloidy parts of the review, he'd see that some of the programs are actually doing wonders, like the well-known 'Condensed Renewable Aggregation Production'. You know the common denominator of the successful ones? They're not run by the government. Instead of mindlessly dropping all your funding, how about turning it all over to us? We'll completely eliminate the bureaucratic mess you have today, and we'll publish really tasteful brochures about everything that went well."

3. "You do know what 'NGO' stands for, right?" queries your trusted civil servant @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It's 'Non-Governable Ordeals', that's what it is. I'm sure these... people... have pure hearts, but they're not going to settle; they'll have lobbyists out day and night pushing for you to increase their share of our budget. Let me and my colleagues at the Department of Bureaucratic Oversight take over our aid commitments. We'll ensure proper implementation in no time, and with only a slight overhead."

[4]. "Why do we care about poor people in places we can't pronounce anyway?" your brother asks frankly, stabbing a virtual beggar in his Panty Theft Auto video game. "Those images of starving children are so passé, and no amount of conscience-cash is going to change a thing. Use that money to prop up some of our domestic industries, like, I don't know, video games, maybe? It's just a matter of time before the problem fades away, I mean, like literally!"

1. "Those maniacs! They blew it all up! Damn them!" wails Dr. Alana Grant, pop-palaeontologist and author of the dubiously-researched [i]Tyrannosaurs of the Jurassic[/i], falling to her knees in horror. "Skeletons like this one provide rare and valuable insight about the history of life on our planet. We must do everything we can to stop these fools from destroying important scientific artifacts! Fortify and defend our museums, by violent means if necessary!"

2. Dr. Maurice Zaius, self proclaimed defender of the faith, slams his religion's holy scrolls down on your desk, smashing your collection of rare ammonites. "These devout believers were doing the work of the Divine! These demon-lizards are fakes, from the depths of damnation! They are fabrications, to promote the ungodly theory that I call EVIL-lution. We should shut down these houses of lies that call themselves museums, and instead create temples that teach only Holy Truth. Sic semper tyrannosaurus!"

3. Mathematician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing a #notallpriests T-shirt has the decency to look embarrassed by the previous speaker. "I'm thinking the underlying problem here is that followers of science and religion are always taught to be adversarial to each other. Couldn't we address that instead, with government-sponsored Faith Academies reconciling the scientific method with theological debate? Many of the greatest advancements were historically made by faith-led nations. Shall we see if we can join them?"

*4. "This raises an interesting point," muses patriotic soldier @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I hear these dinosaurs were gigantic, killer monsters that ate flesh and struck fear into all who opposed them!

2. "If they're looking for money, they should know that we don't have it to give to them," argues former intelligence operative Neil Liamson. "But what we do have is a particular set of skills acquired over many years in government... I'm talking about reactionary counter-terrorist legislation!

The Issue
Protesting a recent policy decision you made, one of your prominent cabinet ministers, Judas Benedict, today crossed the floor and joined the main opposition party. You and some more loyal ministers are now holding an emergency debate on this.

The Debate
1. "Floor-crossing is against democracy!" roars your Majority Whip, literally taking a birch rod to the backside of a recalcitrant backbencher. "Not only is floor-crossing a betrayal of the the party, it is a betrayal of the voters who elect politicians on the basis of their political party. When politicians leave their party they must resign and seek re-election."

2. "@@LEADER@@, the only reason you're getting upset is because one of yours came to us," gloats the Leader of the Opposition, helping himself to a sandwich from your lunchbox. "Sometimes people have a change of heart and begin to see the world in a different light. It is the right of every person and politician to ally themselves with whatever party best suits their conscience. The people give democratic mandate to the individual, who then uses it according to best judgement."

3. "I have a solution that renders the whole problem of floor-crossing moot," interjects independent politician @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ from the back of the crowded room, hoping you'll notice her. "Why don't we simply scrap all political parties and have every politician run as an independent? Think about it! Partisan loyalty is a barrier to true freedom.

The Issue
After encouraging the anti-vaccination movement, vaccine rates have continued to drop while Rubellan Measles has reached epidemic levels. As thousands more grow ill every day, voices across the nation are pleading with you to do something before the situation becomes completely untenable.

The Debate
1. "I warned you there would be consequences to encouraging this anti-vaccine movement!" reminds your Health Minister, ominously decked out in a full hazmat suit. "With drastic action we might still be able to right this ship: declare martial law, prevent all non-essential personnel from leaving their homes, and proclaim mandatory hospital quarantines for anyone who might be showing symptoms. With emergency funding for healthcare and the military, @@NAME@@ will endure. This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but without it, the results would be absolutely ghastly. And for Violet's sake, bring back a comprehensive vaccination program!"

2. "That would be horrendously expensive!" cries one of your more brutal body guards. "I have a solution that's slightly more... direct. I say we take care of the problem before it can spread further. Put me in charge of a 'Sanitation Squad' and anyone who starts to show any signs of being sick with Rubellan Measles will be taken care of if you know what I mean." He gestures at his weapon. "If everyone who is sick is 'removed', we will be disease free overnight."

[3]. "Domina Hyacinthinum, dona eis requiem," chants local abbot, Father @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, while walking into the meeting and whacking himself in the head with a board. "Blessings, Scipio.

The Issue
Earlier this week, you were supposed to meet with the first disabled team of explorers to conquer the icy slopes of the Bigtopian tundra. However, your office proved to be inaccessible to the adventurers and the meeting was cancelled. Disability awareness groups are outraged that those with impairments can't access government buildings, many of which provide them the help and support they need.

The Debate
1. "We must put an end to the discrimination against people with disabilities," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the spokesperson of the awareness group All Access, through a speech synthesizer. "Many of us face great difficulty in climbing steps, reading text, or listening to auditory sources or conveying messages. The government must improve the accessibility to premises and information so that we are treated fairly and have the ability to contribute to society."

2. "It might sound nice to have more ramps and guide dogs, but the real problem isn't infrastructure, it's society's treatment of the intellectually and physically disadvantaged," observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a concerned parent. "If people had stopped to open doors, and to help the disabled athletes up the steps, then we wouldn't need special adaptations to the buildings. Kindness and helpfulness should be taught at school, with kids learning to assist those who need help and to stop bullying them because they're different. That's the way to go forward."

3. "Hold on a minute! Making modifications to historic government buildings is cultural vandalism and awfully expensive!" objects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your rather obsessive Minister of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Heritage. "We can't destroy centuries' worth of history and deface the structures with modern architecture just to improve accessibility!

If you want quality service to flourish, then compulsory military service will teach respect to these scallywags!"

2. After you extricate yourself, you engage in a brief chat with two floor staff who are just returning from their mid-morning coffee break, Betty Sugden and Wilberforce Inman. "The reason we're unhappy," declares Mrs. Sugden, "is because we are constantly late due to overcrowded buses and trains! Even if I'm one second late, I get told off for it! Is it any wonder that I'm so wound up that I snap at people? I'm so upset when I get home that I end up being mean to my poor pussy!" After an awkward pause, Mr. Inman interjects. "She means her cat. But she's right! With lives as hard as ours, it is any wonder that men swear? You should provide more transport, so that there's always an empty seat calling out [i]'I'm freeeee!'[/i] on the buses!"

3. As you make your way towards the elevator to leave, you are approached and then harangued by the elderly and curmudgeonly head of the Gent's section, a Mr. Ernest Stranger, and you briefly explain the reason for your visit. "Rude? RUDE? Who says we're rude! Get me a glass of water Mr. Inman!" He collapses into a chair. "I've been serving for over 35 years, I damn well don't need any advice on how to treat customers! In fact, if these customers don't meet [i]my[/i] standards, I should have the right to refuse to serve them, full stop - make it law! Now since you're not going to buy anything, you'll excuse me, I have to go put in my afternoon set of teeth."

[b][anchor=661]#661[/anchor]: Scouting For Boys, Girls... Anyone? [Golgothastan; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Scouts, a volunteer youth group that teaches boys and girls outdoor survival skills, are reporting sharply declining numbers. The organization's annual meet was attended by just seven and a half Scouts (as there was an unfortunate accident involving a canoe made out of recycled soup cans). Some within the community are urging the government to help revive interest in outdoor pursuits among young people.

The Debate
1. "Dear Leader, we humbly beg your favor!" is spelled out in woodcraft sign language on a poster decorated with pictures of tents, trees, and wild @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@. The Scout who brought the poster into your office begins to explain, "Scouting has really suffered from a lack of state support. We give back to the community, learn valuable life skills, and get to socialize with other young people, all in the spirit of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ patriotism. And with some government funding, maybe we could afford some slightly less frayed guide ropes for our climbing wall?"

2. "Scouting is a hobby, nothing more," grumbles notoriously @@CURRENCY@@-pinching auditor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What's next, are we going to start giving subsidies to model aircraft building clubs? Knitting circles? Mustache enthusiasts? Treasury funds are for essential projects only. If the Scouts can't get by without state support, then they should go out of business like any other private organization would."

3. "You're talking about ending a tradition of Scouting that goes back more than a century!" complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a military historian who has won several awards for exceptionally dry accounts of dramatic battles. "I got my start in fieldcraft as a Scout, just like many of our nation's greatest heroes. The young people of today don't know what they're missing out on. In fact, maybe if you forced them all to join the Scouts, they'd soon see what fun it was!"

4. "All this tradition stuff is exactly why kids aren't interested in Scouting anymore," snarks your appallingly cynical niece, who only looks up from her phone to roll her eyes. "What use are badges for campfire building and map reading when we have central heating and GPS? If Scouting taught some more modern skills, maybe you'd have more young people interested."

[5]. "If it's just a matter of money, then perhaps I can be of assistance?" oozes industrial magnate Kanya Yeats, looking up from an Ayn Bland e-book. "My firm has offered to sponsor the Scouts before, but unfortunately those pesky child safety laws have prevented us from offering them a truly rounded experience. What youngster wouldn't love the chance to go sailing in a MaxCorp-branded dinghy, or hiking in a pair of new Zephyr Holdings-sponsored walking boots! Or even gain a little practical experience and valuable life training volunteering at our steel mills?" [[color=red]Children may not work[/color]]

[b][anchor=662]#662[/anchor]: Playful Petitions Pester Politicians [Helaw; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A petition calling for you to wear nothing but swimming attire and a top hat during speeches and public events was discussed in detail by the government, including a fierce debate on which colours would suit you best. After updating your wardrobe, and feeling angry and somewhat embarrassed, you called for a meeting with your advisers to discuss how ridiculous petitions seem to have become.

The Debate
1. "Your fashion choices aside, these petitions are getting out of hand," claims a rather stressed-out aide after taking a nap on a mountain of petitions. "Not a day passes without me being inundated with senseless petitions, like asking us to ban breathing or to add whale surfing to the national curriculum. We should introduce petition curators to make sure that only the legitimate petitions make it through; they'll cut out the... less desirable ones."

2. "Why waste time with petitions anyway?" tuts one of your top staffers while absentmindedly shredding a petition to construct something called a 'Death Star'. "These petitions are a waste of everyone's time, and we'd be better off ignoring them. It's not like their opinions matter. We shouldn't concern ourselves with what - for instance - people think our public buildings should look like. Seriously, banana-shaped offices?"

3. "People have the right to sign some paper and complain about how things are being run," presses one of your more eager assistants, who dreams of becoming a politician one day. "It doesn't matter how ridiculous a petition may seem; it should be looked at in detail to see if it has merit, even if that requires extra work for us. There must be something useful to be found within them, surely..."

4. "I think this petition makes a very important point," argues your Minister of Making Things Look Good, who also happens to be your personal hairstylist. "You could really do with a makeover! Everyone knows that your approval ratings would absolutely skyrocket, and that your speeches would have a new lease of life to them. After all, if a petition calls for you to change your appearance, then obviously people think you'd look better that way."

The Issue
The aggressive nation of Blackacre has been struck with a series of massive natural disasters that have killed tens of thousands and destroyed sanitation, transit, and economic infrastructure, with the likely consequence of great suffering for millions in the coming months. This has presented you with the moral quandary of whether or not you should come to the aid of a nation that has frequently declared its hatred for @@NAME@@ and the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ way of life.

The Debate
1. "Well, it serves them darn well right!" shouts your infuriated Minister of Defense, furiously kicking your expensive imported mahogany desk and sending your papers flying. "An eye for an eye, I say! They insulted us multiple times, and they got what they deserved. As a matter of fact, now is the perfect time to truly pay them back for their slander of our great nation! They want aid? How about we aid them by sending some missiles aimed right at their capital? That'll show them!"

2. "Not that I don't agree with Mr. Compassionate over here, but that particular method only seems to stir up unwanted trouble," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@NAME@@'s top chess master and military strategist. "Frankly, there's a much better way of making our point without causing so much international outcry. Why not provide them aid, but so much of it that they become dependent on us for survival? Flood them with food, but do nothing to help their farmers. Supply them with power, but don't build power infrastructure. Then, when they've lost any capacity to support themselves, start charging them! We can look good internationally while secretly waging war against their economy."

3. "It's just too much effort these days to try to take over another country," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, former soldier and current aide to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. "For that matter, it's too much effort to even provide aid when we have so much to focus on here. Crime, poverty, resources, and all that. It's a shame what's happened, but we aren't the only nation in the world. Let's cut all aid. There's probably some other nation that'll be foolish enough to help them out, anyway."

4. "Regardless of what Blackacre's government's actions have been in the past, there are millions of innocent civilians who are going to be harmed or even killed," suggests your secretary while cleaning the mess of papers off your desk. "How would you feel if you were homeless and hungry, and others turned a blind eye? This is a humanitarian disaster. We need to send aid and do whatever we can to help. Helping them is the moral thing to do, and that's all there is to it."

The Issue
A large aluminium deposit has been found at @@ANIMAL@@ Hills, a remote area in @@NAME@@. The Environmental Agency is being unusually easy-going, citing minimal potential ecological impact and approving mining to go ahead. Only one obstacle exists - the deposit is right in the middle of a sacred area of the indigenous Pangaoaoangan tribe.

The Debate
1. "Did you know that aluminium is the second most commonly used metal in our economy, after steel?" quizzes aluminium afficionado and bauxite buff @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pointing to an 'Ask Me About Electrolysis' pin-badge proudly displayed on an ironed lapel. "This high quality deposit is a gold mine! Not literally of course, I'm just 'funning' with you. We're talking minimal tailings, starting at just minus 100 metres! Isn't that exciting? Oh my goodness, there's so much we can do when we have aluminium! Why hesitate?"

2. "@@LEADER@@, you must see it from our side," insists @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a tribal elder wearing a sharp business suit and a worker's hard hat. "Pullabooka - or as you call it - the @@ANIMAL@@ Hills, belongs to my people. You cut into it, and you're not just profaning a holy site, you're cutting us out of your society! Look, we're not blind to your economic needs: if you want to mine your metal, why not start seventy miles to the north instead, across that river canyon, then tunnel your way across to the deep deposits? A thousand generations of my ancestors are watching you, @@LEADER@@. Do the right thing!"

[3]. "That sounds kind of expensive... bit of a dealbreaker if we can't turn a profit," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a spokesperson from @@CAPITAL@@ Mining Company's Corporate Social Responsibility arm. "Look, we don't need to convince ALL the locals. Let's just convince the tribal council.

The Issue
Troubled by the number of technophobic zealots, book burning fundamentalists, and knife-waving cultists constantly parading through your office, a coalition of concerned churchgoers are trying to remind you that organized religion can do good too.

The Debate
1. "Don't let the weirdos and extremists color your perception," pleads faith leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dropping a bushel of pamphlets and tracts into your in-tray. "Followers of @@RELIGION@@ help the people of our good nation with a multitude of community outreach programs. We don't need money, @@LEADER@@, but it'd set a great example to the people if you personally would head down to one of our shelters once a week to do some hands-on volunteer work, sing a few hymns, serve some soup to the homeless and hungry, that sort of thing. Just think, you could lead @@NAME@@ - or indeed all of @@REGION@@ - into a new age of altruism and charity!"

2. "Let's not forget the festivals and the songs of praise," adds @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an enthusiastic community volunteer with an acoustic guitar. "@@RELIGION@@ has always been at the heart of our nation's identity and culture, and I would say that the music is the route to brighter lives and stronger souls. I suggest you invest in a performance arena where we can all come together in celebration of the Divine. Who knows, it might even attract tourist pilgrims from far away lands."

3. "Now hear the testimony of a proud son of @@RELIGION@@," bellows televangelist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, entering your office through a cloud of laser-filled mist and to a backdrop of deafening music. "The purpose of religion in society is the purpose of salvation. Ask not what @@RELIGION@@ can do for your nation, but what you can do for @@RELIGION@@. Fund me, and I can broadcast our holy message all across @@REGION@@! Donate now, @@LEADER@@, and save your soul. Praise be! PRAAAAAAISE BE!"

4. "Couldn't help but overhear," interrupts @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a retired history teacher apparently on a tour of the building, poking her head through the door of your office, "but if you ask me, the separation of church and state is fundamental to modern government. Taxpayer money should never be given to religions or religious organizations - we must rid you of turbulent priests! After all, have you seen how many of these religious nutters are technophobic zealots, book-burners, or knife wielding cultists?"

[b][anchor=666]#666[/anchor]: A Microchip On Your Shoulder [Minoa; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Contactless payment, internet banking and robust consumer credit mechanisms are already making shopping easier than any time in history. However, a technology think tank is proposing that you could stimulate the economy by going one step further, with universal subcutaneous microchips linked to a national @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Identity Database.

The Debate
1. @@RANDONMFIRSTNAME@@ Tenhorn, head of the think tank, is enthusiastic. "No need for wallets or purses any more: just walk out with the goods, and your credit account is updated! Also, you could link medical data, GPS-tracking, biometrics data... the benefits are legion! I mean, we're not talking a barcode under your left eye or anything mad like that, just an unobtrusive digital implant, anywhere on the body. Oh brave new world, that has such gadgets in it!"

2. "We must reject the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Identity Database!" raves @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Apollyon, leader of the @@NAME@@ Resistance Against the Identity Database (@@NAME_INITIALS@@-RAID) campaign group. "In the name of 'national security', law-abiding citizens will end up being forced to lose their privacy. The right to use cash and hard currency is vital to protecting our rights to avoid taxat... uh... to avoid Orwellian monitoring!"

3. "That's not enough!" screams conspiracy theorist Jonty Apostle, adjusting his tinfoil hat to keep radio waves out of his brain. "Do you know how many databases there are out there gathering intelligence on us all? Credit reports, search engine histories, e-mail archives, medical records, criminal records, driving licences... All these little revelations, and you still think it's crazy when I say that we're always being watched? @@LEADER@@, give people back their freedom! Ban government and corporations from tracking our data in any way!"

*4. "Look, we want to keep tabs on our population, but do we really need to deal with all this outrage?" muses Lucy Fir, a promising junior delegate from the Ministry of Creative Solutions. "Why not secretly implant the microchips in newborn babies during routine postnatal checks and in adults during dental work? Sure, people won't be able to shop with a chip that they don't know is there, but in terms of national security and crime prevention, secret surveillance is far more effective than open monitoring."

[b][anchor=667]#667[/anchor]: One Man's Trash Is Another Man's Recyclable [Socialist Nordia; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A recent study by some self-righteous college students revealed that an alarming number of recyclable items are being thrown into the garbage. In order to bring more attention to this issue, a handful of particularly dedicated environmentalists - calling themselves 'Save Our Trash' - are camping out in the dumpster behind your home. They claim that they will not leave until the government takes action.

The Debate
1. "How can people care so little for Mother Earth?" grouses a grouchy, green-haired man named Oscar, who has taken up residence in one of your trash cans. "The government needs to do a hell of a lot more to inform people about the importance of recycling. You should throw everything you've got at the problem: public service announcements, sorting classes for the kids, bins in every conceivable place. You could even fine those lazy people who refuse to properly dispose of recyclables."

2. "There's no reason to punish @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ when industry bears most of the blame for pollution," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while struggling to open a hard plastic stay-fresh shell containing a pre-peeled banana. "By taxing inefficient manufacturers for all of this ridiculously excessive packaging, the government could discourage commercial waste and even make itself some money. Hey, an environmentalist policy that generates revenue - now there's an idea."

3. "Meh. Is this really such a big deal?" yawns city worker @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, finishing off his tea in a delicate porcelain cup, before throwing the whole thing into the nearest garbage can. "Being neurotic over trash just makes people unhappy and forces them to feel guilty about shopping. You should actually be encouraging people to throw stuff away without thinking too hard about it - a culture of disposable items drives consumption, which in turn makes for a strong economy. And that's what matters."

The Issue
At the International Conference of Education, head-teachers and education ministers generally have a drink or ten and get a chance to meet their peers from across the world. The conference happens to be in @@NAME@@ this year and having nothing better to do one night, you decide to attend a mixer. As it happens, the topic of conversation is Standardised Testing...

The Debate
1. Dàguó Education Director Hoo Yu Wan Hia, apparently misunderstanding the nature of the social-mixer, has set up a projector upon a platter of hors d'oeuvres and is currently word-for-word reading off PowerPoint slides. "In Dàguó, standardised tests assess student performance throughout education. Centile-scoring streams the students, gives accurate comparison, and identifies the cream of the crop for industry roles. Next slide, please. This is the foundation of economic success, and also why Dàguó children are so much better at maths and science than the lazy and undisciplined children of your nations. You should adopt the Dàguó system. Any questions?"

2. "Constant testing teaches children only how to pass tests," interjects Antti Markkanen, a progressive head teacher from the socialistic nation of Skandilund, carefully putting down his drink. "Obsession with competition only makes children equate success with dominance. Use carrot and stick methods, and you just get an ass. Pun intended. When children compete, most are taught only that they are losers. Abandon testing, and teach love of knowledge!"

3. "So on the one hand we got rote-learning clones, and on the other, liberal hippies!" spits cowboy-hat wearing Jonnie Wain, interrupting his poker game to literally and metaphorically put his cards on the table. "In the United Federation we got a saying: [i]'Hey Guvmint! Butt out!'[/i]. Let each school be its own business, deciding its own way with no centralized tyranny. Let parents vote with their wallets, and either pick the school they want, or pick no school at all. I was raised on my uncle's farm; I just learned me how to herd steers from the back of a horse. That's real life education!"

4. "Couldn't we be a bit more moderate, try and take something of all three options?" wonders your Education Minister, trying to escape from the trio of foreign educators closing in on her. "Maybe there's a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ way, with compulsory exam assessments, but not a national test, but a choice of examination boards competing on the free market. And maybe you could have some state schools with part private funding, and some private schools with state regulation, and some structured home schooling involving some time in communal classrooms. That sounds good, doesn't it? Maybe? Possibly?"

As residential rooftop solar is increasing in popularity, @@NAME@@ Gas and Electric (@@NAME_INITIALS@@G&E) has begun to offer resistance to the current billing structure, complaining that households' electric bills are so low they can no longer afford to maintain the grid. As rhetoric on all sides has become increasingly high voltage, @@NAME_INITIALS@@G&E is asking you to approve a change in their fee structure.

The Debate
1. CEO Joule Ohm of @@NAME_INITIALS@@G&E sweeps the papers off your desk, slams down his proposed fee structure, and then begins to speak, "If we are to maintain the grid while keeping power affordable for the poor, there has to be a change to the system. We need a flat grid fee charged monthly to all households regardless of energy use. With a grid fee, we can reduce the per kilowatt usage fee, so most users will hardly notice the difference."

2. "I couldn't think of a better plan to kill my business!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the amped-up CEO of Sol Invictus, @@NAME@@'s biggest rooftop solar installation company. "If the power company charges you a huge fee no matter how much power you use, who will want solar panels? I have a bright solution. If @@NAME_INITIALS@@G&E needs more money, let them raise the per kilowatt usage fees for everyone. But we need electricity meters in every household to track energy usage and whether homes with solar panels are producing surplus power to sell back to the grid. Let's let the market determine the price of power!"

3. "I could think of a better way to kill solar." wheezes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the octogenarian CEO of Relaxed Diamond Coal Company. "Ban it! Rooftop solar panels are eyesores, and they're driving out @@NAME@@'s mom and pop coal companies. No more, I say! We're blessed with plentiful coal deposits; let's use them to make cheap, local power. As for those global warming alarmists, why, the weatherman can't even predict tomorrow's weather, never mind the weather 50 years from now."

4. "This problem needs a solution grasped from the future, not grounded in the industrial revolution!" declares celebrity green-energy venture capitalist Melon Husk. "My company is beginning to develop initial prototypes for large-capacity home-use batteries. However, to make this viable in the near future, we just need a smidgen of government subsidies for research and production. I think the batteries we'll develop will be affordable and, combined with solar panels, they'll almost certainly be able to provide households with their energy demands. I'm pretty sure we can make power lines a thing of the past!"

The Debate
1. "We have to balance safety with helping people who are just looking for a better life," states Minister of Internal Affairs, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, while drinking her half-full cup of coffee. "Why don't we just carefully screen potential refugees to see if they have any connections to terrorists?

The Issue
While perusing the grand governmental libraries for the popular graphic novel, "Jee, Gnomes!", you come across numerous documents pertaining to the field of genetic engineering – manipulating the genetic code that dictates the characteristics of all biological life. In a barely comprehensible scientific paper, you read of a proposal to allow the patenting of DNA sequences. Realising that the government has yet to take an official stance, you call together a number of experts in the field that are willing to debate the topic.

The Debate
1. "Researchers work long and hard to understand these genes," claims the CEO of Dynalixa Technologies, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It is simply immoral to tell these scientists that they cannot patent the sequences that they have located and researched, and the notion that the government is willing to make the untold numbers of second best currencies poured into this sector worthless is simply absurd. Enforcement and limitations aside, I am certain that allowing gene patents is the best way forward."

2. "This is pure, unadulterated madness!" cries renowned biologist Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, in a sudden outburst that sends a model fish flying. "You can't just patent the language of life itself! Look, as much as private firms may wish to protect their developments in this field, they have no right to stop others from using them; the law must reflect this. While you're at it, you should seek to subsidise all genetic research; after all, the nation could use more people who know the difference between mRNA and tRNA!"

3. "Both of you are going too far," pipes up your Minister of Science, wielding a helix-shaped pen. "The solution is simple. To prevent people from being sued over their DNA, perhaps we should make patenting genes that are found in nature illegal, while ensuring that artificially created genes are open for companies to argue with each other over. While this could prove quite restricting for some companies, it should theoretically protect the average consumer, while preventing companies in the industry from completely losing the right to patent their research."

4. "Gene editing? Compromises? Come on," says your exhausted and agitated secretary, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while handing you a cup of coffee. "All of this hullabaloo could be avoided by just getting rid of it all. I'm quite happy being me, and I don't think anyone has the right to poke around in my code.

2. "It's not our fault," sighs bedraggled geologist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, pushing her glasses back onto her nose. "The problem is that we're poorly funded and under-equipped.

Brancalandian pop star Bryan Leeper has gotten into trouble with the law yet again while on tour in @@NAME@@. He was caught urinating on a fire hydrant, making this his tenth arrest in the past year. Tens of thousands of anti-Bleepers have signed a petition demanding that the pop star be deported back to his native Brancaland.

He can go love himself back home. We demand that he be declared a public menace. May he never return to our fair country nor inflict his immature, overly catchy, pop music on our airwaves."

2. "We don't want the little brat back!" declares the Brancalandian Foreign Minister, seen smashing Bryan Leeper CDs with a hockey stick. "I bumped into the Maxtopian ambassador on my way here. It seems that Mr. Leeper has an outstanding legal issue over in Maxtopia that could involve jail time if he's found guilty. Why not extradite him there as a diplomatic move? What's that? Well yes, Maxtopia has the death penalty. I'm sure he hasn't done anything that serious there."

3. "All I need, is your love, your love, my love, your love, youuuuuuu!" sings your teenage niece's best friend, who is also president of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Bryan Leeper Fan Club. "You can't send him away! He's a troubled young artist trying to find his way. His message is pure and sweet and he's, like, so totally dreamy. Listen!"

[b][anchor=674]#674[/anchor]: Let Them Eat Rainbow Cake! [Galway-Dublin; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
When high-profile lesbian celebrity Ellen Lynch was asked to leave popular establishment [i]@@CAPITAL@@ Diner[/i], it was made clear to her that this was because she was dining with her lesbian partner. The restaurant owners refused to serve the homosexual couple, citing a conflict with their religious beliefs. This isn't the first time something like this has been flagged by the press, but Lynch is keen to make some noise.

The Debate
1. "I have the right to my values!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the diner owner. "My grandfather, who opened this restaurant 50 years ago, was a man of faith. This faith gave him his love of family values and family dining. He believed homosexuality to be degenerate and sinful! I'm not saying that these people can't sin in their own homes, but must I sit there watching them commit unholy acts in my business? What about my freedom to express religious belief? What about my economic rights as a business owner?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

2. "I have the right to my values!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the manager of the diner. "My grandfather, who opened this restaurant 50 years ago, was a man of faith.

I"m not saying that these people can"t sin in their own homes, but must I sit there watching them commit unholy acts in my business? What about my freedom to express religious belief? What about my economic rights as a state-licensed business operator?" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

3. "We remain a minority whose voice never gets heard!" exclaims Ellen Lynch, on her nationally syndicated talk show. "It is my hope that the government enforces protection of LGBT individuals in these kinds of situations by forcing businesses to serve anyone, regardless of their sexuality. Religious bigotry has no place at our tables!"

4. The Deputy Mayor of @@CAPITAL@@, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ strides in, dashingly pink trench coat flapping in the breeze behind him. "The mayor won't like this, but if we want @@NAME@@ to be a prestigious and progressive nation on the world stage, we've got to go even further! To cater for... that is to protect the rights of the gay community, we should establish zones in each restaurant or other service industry venture that are reserved exclusively for gay and lesbian people. Think of our standing in the international gay community! Think of the tourism! We'd be a shining beacon for gay culture!"

[b][anchor=675]#675[/anchor]: Trick Or Treaty [Ransium; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
After lengthy political wrangling, a global treaty on reducing greenhouse gas emissions has been put on the table. World powers such as Brancaland, Blackacre and Dàguó have moved to ratify the treaty, and the heat is on for @@NAME@@ to make a decision.

The Debate
1. "Only through coordinated international action can we deal with the crisis of climate change," preaches @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has spent the better part of a decade as @@NAME@@'s lead negotiator for the treaty. "The emissions reduction targets in this treaty are achievable, and affordable. @@LEADER@@, for our children's future, we must ratify this treaty."

2. "What mankind does has no bearing on whether the weather is warm," rants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a columnist at the think-tank [i]Convenient Truths[/i]. "Ratifying this treaty would be economic suicide, and it's well-known that the threats of so-called 'climate change' have been exaggerated by countries like Dàguó in order to cripple our economy. You must refuse to ratify this treaty!"

3. "You know, I was beginning to warm up to this treaty," argues hot-headed environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "But then, I got to the proposed emissions reduction targets: they're pathetic! We do need to set an international example, but not by ratifying this worthless treaty. Instead, we must pass national legislation that properly addresses the magnitude of our problem. Like, oh I don't know, an eighty percent reduction of all emissions by next Tuesday."

4. "All this has me thinking," muses @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@, an economics professor specializing in game theory, who is simultaneously playing chess with your aide. "The emissions reductions would impact our economy, but not ratifying the treaty would adversely affect our international reputation. I noticed that the compliance verification provisions are quite... lax. So let's ratify, do some lip-service, and then forget about it. It'll give us a competitive advantage." With a flourish, she moves her queen across the chessboard, "Check and mate!"

The Issue
After numerous cases of brief delirium were reported in the countryside, local scientists and health officials have narrowed down the potential causes to a hallucinogenic toxin produced by a microbe that normally incubates within rabbits. Apparently, the close contact rural farmers had with tainted rabbit excrement resulted in their delusions. In response, several apoplectic and assertive citizens have accosted you while on your morning stroll to deal with the issue.

The Debate
1. "This is ridiculous," shouts avid home gardener Alice Cheshire. "I can't even tend my own flower beds without falling into a psychedelic trance! If I hallucinate one more rabbit wearing a waistcoat and a pocket watch, I'm gonna lose it. We must eradicate this menace, even if it means killing all the rabbits in @@NAME@@! OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!"

2. "Whoa, whoa, whoa... Let's not be too hasty here," interjects microbiologist and pharmaceutical spokeswoman Anita Plaseebeau. "This rabbit colon-based microbe gives us a rare and profitable opportunity to further both our understanding of biology and medicine. Throw a little funding our way, and we can trap some live specimens, analyze the microbe up close, and get all of Pencil Sharpeners hooked on it by Sunday."

3. "You all keep missing the point! These aren't just hallucinations caused by poop, they're gifts from the Great Rabbit Goddess!" asserts escaped mental patient and neopagan Sybil @@ANIMAL@@-McGee wearing her ceremonial rabbit-patterned robe and bunny slippers. "Through consuming the rabbits' sacred defecation, we are blessed with miraculous visions of the future! Heed my prophecies, and I'll get @@NAME@@ on the right path in no time." After swallowing a handful of rabbit droppings, she twitches awkwardly on the ground while sputtering ill-fated prognostications.

The Issue
After a recent unfortunate incident involving a foreign casino, a gambling addicted crime lord, and a secret agent that was a bit too confident in his poker playing abilities, the government is currently strapped for cash. Your Finance Minister has reminded you of a swathe of delinquent government loans made to a small nameless nation in your sphere of influence that could be called in to close the budget gap.

The Debate
1. "If they can't pay up, why we'll get a @@REGION@@ tribunal involved!" declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Finance Minister. "Start by removing their spendthrift leadership, and install a stooge, er... someone who understands the gravity of their international obligations. Next, forcibly privatize some of the most easily monetized state services. Why, I bet some of@@NAME@@'s businesses might even be interested in buying them."

2. "How soft!" mutters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leader of the infamous 'Loan and Pool Shark' mercenaries, while menacingly holding a pool cue. "It's time you went full repo man on these money squanderers and take what's owed to you. They won't dare to object to a few of their warships, crown jewels, or national treasures going to the cause."

3. "A thousand pardons @@LEADER@@!" pleads the country's ambassador, Owen Dett, while kissing your feet. "Although our nation is a mere insignificant speck of dirt compared to the might and majesty of your nation, we implore you to find it within your heart to forgive the debts of us, the most 'umblest of nations."

The Issue
Today you've had a full schedule: meeting lobbyists who want you to name lunch the most important meal of the day, handshaking and congratulating @@NAME@@'s gold-medal-winning @@ANIMAL@@ball team, and fielding surprisingly piercing questions from a classroom of carefully selected ten-year-olds. It's been hard for you to attend to the business of state, much less find any time for yourself. It occurs to you that having a deputy leader to help handle the workload might not be such a bad idea.

The Debate
1. "Voters don't discriminate between heads of state or, wait for it, their running mates," explains Erin Splinter, a rising star within your party. "And we'll keep winning, so why not have a second-in-command aboard? Someone whose ideology you understand, but who increases your demographic appeal, be they @@DEMONYM@@ or Bigtopian. You're gonna need a right-hand man, or woman." She kisses a gauntlet of babies on her way out of your office.

2. "Whaaat?" The leader of the opposition sneezes for emphasis. "Did I miss something here, or are we still a democracy? The runner-up should be the deputy, so they can go watch, oh, rap battles and stuff and get in touch with the little people. Creative dissent is what makes @@NAME@@ strong!"

3. "We don't really need a deputy leader, do we?" muses dedicated method actor Alex Miranda, who boasts an eerie resemblance to you. "Whenever you need to take a break, I'll go argue about banks or mourn at generals' funerals." Miranda adjusts a duelling cane and a pair of glasses. "I think I've got your accent down, too! [i]@@SLOGAN@@![/i]"

4. "As if anyone else in the room could accomplish as much as you," scoffs your personal assistant, trying not to overload you with your calendar for the next week. "You'll just have to work nonstop and struggle every second, but that should be no problem for you, @@LEADER@@! @@NAME@@ will still be a strong central democracy even if you're booked day and night."

[b][anchor=679]#679[/anchor]: Space Is Big Enough For The Both Of Us [Drayxaso; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
In a shocking turn of events, the normally secretive East Lebatuck government proposed working with multiple space programs. They have offered to work with the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Space Agency to create a jointly-operated space station, called the Multinational Space Station, or MSS. The scientific community has concluded that a space station would be utterly cool and might even provide the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Space Agency with valuable scientific data, but some are concerned about working with East Lebatuck.

The Debate
1. "Comrade @@LEADER@@, there is no reason for any mistrust between us," comments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the East Lebatuckese representative, while discreetly placing a listening device under a pot plant. "Our proposal would launch @@NAME@@'s space program to new heights while setting a glorious example of friendship between our two great Motherlands. We're ready to launch the 'Spyonya' module, so just hurry up and agree to build the station already."

2. "A jointly-operated space station might be one small step for international cooperation, but our own space station would be a giant leap for @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@kind," declares hero astronaut Hum Legstrong, who has arrived wearing a space suit for reasons you cannot fathom. "All we need to do is repurpose some leftover parts from the last few spaceship programs. Fuel tank? Bam, crew quarters! Spy Satellite? Bam, space telescope! We'll get all the sciencey goodness for a low, low price, and we won't have to trust those shady East Lebatuckese."

3. "A space station? Really?" remarks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an unpopular and rather frugal politician, nibbling at a homemade peanut butter sandwich. "Those nerds may act satisfied, but they'll just be begging for more funding next week. Take a page from Maxtopia's book and slash @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Space Agency's budget. We might get less of that 'science' stuff, but who cares? No one, because they'll be too busy enjoying the tax cut. It's not like space is going anywhere."

[b][anchor=680]#680[/anchor]: The Fault Is In Our Stars [Drasnia; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
Your Astrological Advisor has yet again called for an immediate halt to all governmental activities. When questioned, she insisted that it must be done as the skies have been clouded over for several days, thus making astral readings too inaccurate for any important decisions to be made. Flanked by a colorful variety of different personalities and opinions, she has stridden into your office to warn you of great danger.

The Debate
1. "It is an omen of the oncoming storm!" cries your Astrological Advisor, tightly clutching her copy of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Horoscope and a mysterious blue book. "For years the stars have blessed us with their favor, but now that they are gone we can only assume that they have abandoned us! @@LEADER@@, for the sake of @@NAME@@, the government should do as little as possible during these uncertain and dangerous times. You never know what those Gemini folks could be planning!"

2. "The government's actions shouldn't be dictated by such crackpot nonsense!" blusters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a renowned atheist and Gemini. "As a nation, we must strive to put aside our archaic astrological beliefs and instead focus on a logic-based approach. Only through this can we function properly as a political institution. If this means getting rid of all these so-called star prophets, so be it. Besides, they're just big spheres of exploding gas!"

3. "The problem is not in the stars," laments astronomer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Capricorn who is feeling somewhat under the weather this week. "Instead, it lies with our tools. We lack the powerful telescopes needed to see through this cloud cover. With a small contribution from the public, we can build a gigantic telescope that will give us pictures of the constellations no matter what the weather may be!"

4. "Stars, huh, what are they good for?" says self-proclaimed 'Alternative Diviner' @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while tossing a handful of asparagus stalks in the air. "We can't just shut down the government every time a cloud is in the sky. This sort of thing will keep happening again and again and again. If you hire me, I will use more reliable methods such as asparamancy and tyromancy. That way, when I'm done divining, you'll have delicious asparagus and cheese to eat afterward for no cost at all."

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ New Year has arrived again and citizens across the nation are setting off fireworks that light up the sky in a beautiful and awe-inspiring display. Lighting up @@NAME@@'s roads, however, are the sirens of emergency vehicles tending to the injuries and fires caused by the explosive revelries. Your Minister of Safety has twisted your arm to personally investigate the situation, so you've reluctantly left your own New Year's party to venture to the local hospital.

The Debate
1. A frazzled ER doctor, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, begins lecturing you while distractedly stitching a patient. "I can't take it any more! Every New Year, the number of patients in the burn ward explodes, and need for stitches skyrockets! Fireworks are clearly too dangerous for the untrained public to play with. We need to ban possession and use of fireworks without proper training. To keep the tradition of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ New Year alive, the government can sanction shows and hire licensed professionals for the celebration. And hey, if I weren't suddenly getting so many emergency calls on the New Year, maybe I'd actually have time to watch the show."

2. "That's not going far enough," interjects a local bird watcher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is standing by the window, binoculars trained on a vulture by the hospital morgue. "It's not a celebration for the birds whose sky we're shooting into! Animals don't understand what's going on when unnatural flashes and scary noises suddenly start bursting all around them. If they dodge the explosions, noxious smoke is sure to drive birds out of the sky, while remains of spent fireworks littering the streets pose a swallowing hazard for scavengers. Licensing fireworks operators won't change this. We need to ban all fireworks, and find less inconsiderate ways to entertain ourselves."

3. "That's ridiculous," retorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@ - Chief Technical Officer of the [i]Have a Blast[/i] fireworks factory - who is visiting the burns ward to hand out free sparklers to the injured. "Thunderstorms happen all the time in nature, and animals survive those. Fireworks are fabulous fun! If some drunken idiots can't read the clear safety instructions we supply with all our products, then, well, that's natural selection doing our species a favor. In fact, we should legalize use of fireworks all year round. Then we can celebrate anything, anytime, not just the New Year."

Three days ago smog levels in the inner city reached a record-breaking high, with visibility so poor that a driver mistook a closed-off construction zone for an off-ramp and plummeted to his death. The public has raised the question of whether automobiles are emitting too much pollution.

The Debate
1. "This pollution has gotten out of hand!" gasps concerned inner city teacher, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Just last week, my school had to keep the children from going outside because the air was burning their skin! You need to implement a tax on vehicle emissions, and fund scrappage of inefficient older vehicles!"

[2]. "Legislating against polluting cars is not going to solve the problem, as car companies will always find some loophole or deception to trick the system," observes CEO of IntraCoil Motors, Oolong Musk. "Electric vehicles don't pollute locally, so if everyone drove them, we would have clean air in the cities. The government should fund the creation of charging stations, to give customers the choice to realistically switch to green technologies, like the new IntraCoil Model LXIX, available next month at your local dealership." He winks at a nearby camera. [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

[3]. "The government wants to do WHAT now?" yells Oil Tycoon @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You really want to put all those poor drillers and oil riggers out of work? You really want to wreck our nation's petrochemical industries? Instead of listening to these crazy 'environmental' hippies, let the free market operate and self-correct! Besides, everyone knows those electric cars actually cause cancer anyway." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

[4]. "Comrade, the problem here is that the Workers are not cooperating, like good Socialists should," observes Party Member @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Require all of our Comrade-Citizens to carpool to a vehicle's capacity, and you will more than halve the number of vehicles on the road." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

5. Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who says @@HE@@'s from [i]The Institute[/i] - though you're not sure whether @@HE@@'s talking about a research lab or a mental health unit - has one final idea. "All this jibber-jabber about cars has really got me thinking: why don't we give people an alternative? With funding, my lab could build an amazing, floating Sky-Train!

It's a fantastic way to have students learn logic, engineering, and mathematics. Through my curriculum kids can learn programming all while doing what they like best: playing video games!" He shows you one of his online courses, where students are tasked with solving basic logic problems to navigate through a maze themed after the popular mobile game '@@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ Vs Skeletons'. "Well, we don't want to overwhelm the kiddos, do we?"

2. "Kids aren't gonna get anywhere with this Highlights-puzzle trash!" rants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a respected member of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ coding community.

"We'll need a tax increase to recruit a new cohort of teachers with computer science expertise, but programming literacy will increase exponentially."

3. "Why should @@CAPITAL@@ dictate how I teach my kids?" demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, superintendent of a rural school distinct in the southern part of North-West @@NAME@@. "How about the centralized government butt-out for once and let individual school districts decide what's best to teach their students?

But, by the same token, if parents in my district want me to dedicate an hour a day to teaching students about sheep husbandry, that should be fine too."

1. "Marche Noire did this," grunts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your implacable Minister of International Relations, wearing a hole in your carpet as @@HE@@ paces in @@HIS@@ Army-surplus boots. "Ms. Lukin was a respected resident of our country, and they killed her. Well, I say we show those Marche Noirian mouth-breathers that they can't treat our household names this way.

2. "Let's not be excessive," chuckles @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, Minister of Cover-Ups and International Trade, who coincidentally part-owns an authentic Marche Noirian restaurant. "@@LEADER@@, for the sake of trade, you must ignore this little protocol slippage. Take away Marche Noire mountain truffles shaved over a Marche Bay lobster linguini and served in a hand-carved hickory bowl and the @@TYPE@@ will riot. Perhaps it was an accident?

3. "@@LEADER@@," whispers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Head of Secret Service, "no-one's suggesting we let Marche Noire get away with murder.

"We have to send a strongly-worded letter to their government to request that they do something to stop the parties responsible, if they'd be so kind.

Why just the other day, I was being courted by this youthful hunk of a gentleman on MatchMakers. But, when we finally met in person, the scoundrel was as old and flabby as me!

[b][anchor=688]#688[/anchor]: You Don't Have To Be Mad To Kill People... But It Helps [Liberamare; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
@@NAME@@ was in shock after a recent mass murder, and shocked again when the suspect pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, after a privately employed psychiatrist convinced the courts that he had no ability to tell right from wrong. @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are deeply divided over the notion of insanity pleas, and many angry citizens are demanding that you step in.

The Debate
1. "The only thing that's insane is that you're actually considering allowing this!" cries a parent of one of the victims of the attack. "Whether or not this man is insane doesn't change the fact that my son is gone! This... murderer could have easily accessed psychiatric help and must take responsibility for his actions. He should face a proper jail sentence in a proper jail. All these insanity pleas do is give criminals an opportunity to abuse the system. We must show the scum of @@NAME@@ that they can't hide behind so-called 'pleas'! Justice must prevail!"

2. "Actually, it is very difficult for the mentally ill to get the help they need in @@NAME@@," reminds the suspect's attorney after receiving a death glare from the parent. "It is not their fault that they're suffering and any psychiatrist worth their degree would agree that many don't have the mental capacity to determine right from wrong. We should be sending these people to mental institutions where they can be healed, not overcrowded prisons!"

3. "The solution to everything is a compromise," declares one of your staffers, who claims that working for you has caused him to go insane. "Require everyone accused of a crime to go through vigorous mental health testing to see if they are insane or not. This way, experts decide whether or not someone is insane at the beginning of a trial, leaving little room for errors."

[b][anchor=689]#689[/anchor]: A Sticky Situation [Dytarma; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
While lounging on a curiously sticky bench in @@CAPITAL@@, you begin to notice that almost every passer-by seems to be mysteriously stuck to the pavement. Upon closer inspection, you realise that the ground is covered in chewing gum, which has in turn caused the unfortunate - and admittedly amusing - predicament that the pedestrians have now found themselves in. You are soon approached by a colorful mob of people, the majority of which are barely able to lift their own legs.

The Debate
1. "Every time I go on a run, I always find at least one piece of gum on my shoe!" screeches @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whilst furiously picking @@HIM@@self up off the ground. "I always end up stepping in the stuff, and it's always a pain to get off. Gum is a health hazard, and it should be banned before anyone else finds themselves chewing the pavement! If somebody has a problem with that, then they can just find something else to gnaw on."

*2. "Don't listen to that gum-hating buffoon," exclaims the CEO of Suborbit Gum, Minté Breff, while chewing loudly. "Banning gum will cause a tremendous uproar of unnecessary proportions! Gum can help people study and concentrate, all whilst they taste our selection of great flavours; something that the government would surely support and even subsidise! You can have my gum when you pry it out of my cold, dead mouth." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

4. "Why not look for a different solution?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ helps @@HIS@@ son clean gum from his shoes. "How about we place more trashcans? Place a few here and there, fine anyone that doesn't put their gum into them, and I guarantee that this problem will go away.

The Issue
The government's decision to oblige school children to recite the [i]Pledge of Allegiance to @@NAME@@[/i] on a daily basis is proving to be quite controversial. Some parents are upset with the inclusion of references to @@RELIGION@@, @@LEADER@@, and the use of language that can at best be described as 'robustly patriotic', and at worst criticised as bordering on neo-Nazism. They are demanding that you scrap the pledge as being incompatible with modern values.

The Debate
1. "We don't need no thought control!" protests apparently grammatically-challenged parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I'll be damned if I'll allow the schools to brainwash my kids into joining @@LEADER@@'s fan club! Reciting this pledge is a violation of free speech and an insult to everything @@NAME@@ stands for.

4. "Perhaps there's a compromise, yes?" suggests overworked fiction editor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, keen to calm down the heated argument.

Perhaps we could even give people multiple versions to pick from, and leave the odd space blank where people can insert their own chosen phrasing. Free speech is about choice, after all. No matter what we do someone is always going to be offended, but this is making the best of a bad situation."

The Issue
Yesterday, one of the areas that recently seceded from @@NAME@@ was forced to declare itself utterly bankrupt after having spent their entire budget on a gilded statue of their founder. Today, representatives from these new "states" have started reaching out to you to consider the possibility of reconnecting with the Republic.

The Debate
1. "Oh Violet, it's all gone terribly wrong," bemoans 'King' @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, ruler of the [i]Glorious Eastern United @@ANIMAL@@ Empire[/i] (population 12). "I thought it'd be awesome having my own kingdom and everything, but it's actually really hard work!

2. "One little setback and you go running home to mummy," sneers President-for-life @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the [i]Democratic People's Republic of @@CAPITAL@@ Boulevard nr. 10[/i] (population 24), as she signs a series of executive orders.

I think what we need here is for you to provide a forum to promote more diplomatic links, trade and military cooperation with us smaller nations.

3. "I told you at the time this was a stupid idea," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Minister for International Affairs. "These idiots are too busy fighting each other or playing at king to even begin thinking about basic infrastructure, let alone functioning toilets. Seriously, you could spit across most of these places. Nonetheless, our agents report some of them are raising armies literally dozens strong. Enough is enough, Leader: let's welcome back the ones who have seen the error of their ways, bring out the fatted calf and all that, and send in some of our bad hombres to forcefully annex the rest of them."

The Issue
A jet airliner recently made an emergency landing into the @@ANIMAL@@ River after an engines failed during takeoff. Footage has revealed the likely cause of the crash to be a drone sucked into one of the aircraft's engine, and some are questioning the lack of regulations related to drone use.

The Debate
1. "We're lucky nobody was killed in the crash, but we might not be so fortunate next time," murmurs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your overzealous Public Safety Minister, while meticulously covering your letter opener with bubble wrap. "The problems with drones extends beyond planes, too. What if one falls out of the sky and decapitates an innocent bystander? We need sensible regulations of drones to make sure @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are kept safe. The public should only use drones outside of populated areas, at low heights, and only after passing a safety class."

*2. "We don't need draconian regulations just because one idiot didn't read the instructions," rebuffs avid drone enthusiast @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while using a drone to film the meeting. "By that logic we should ban microwaves, just because one person thought it was a fun idea to stick their head inside to see what would happen.

Panic has spread across @@NAME@@ after a study found some bottled water manufactured in @@NAME@@ to be contaminated by [i]E. coli[/i]. Consumers' rights groups have called on you to address this problem, so you're attending a tour of @@NAME@@'s largest bottling plant with some interested parties.

The Debate
1. "Bottled water is a scam!" yells consumer rights advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while getting glared at by various employees. "Did you know, tap water is tested way more often than bottled? Or that some greedy corporations take tap water and mark it up more than ten thousand percent? We need to make the public aware of this! All that is necessary is to advertise tap water, and cut subsidies to the soda industry. It is better for you, me, the environment, and everyone else!"

2. "These claims are just ridiculous!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Glowing Brook Spring Water & Industrial Waste Disposal, while hesitantly taking a small sip of @@HIS@@ product. "Our water has been tested by the best inspectors money can buy, and it's been certified as organic. If anything the government should be promoting bottled water; perhaps with a public health campaign encouraging people to drink eight bottles a day to stave off dehydration."

[3]. "Yeah, tap water is pure, purely full of drugs, am I right?" rambles @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while attempting to give you a high five. "So, yeah, you totally need to get those toxins out of bottled water, but then you have to address a bigger problem. Sure everyone gets high from the tap water, but some squares are being total party poopers by forcing their kids to drink bottled water just cause they're like, drug free. Bummer, right? But I've got a primo solution man, we need to, like, mandate putting drugs in the bottled water too, that way they'll be no escaping getting high. Far out, huh!" [[color=red]Must have compulsory drug use[/color]]

4. "There's a sensible solution to all this," states health inspector @@RANDOM_NAME@@, opening a bottle of water while wearing goggles and a respirator. "Hire more health inspectors! We can take some money from some less vital government programs, like welfare and the military, and then send in government inspectors to do daily testing on the water sources and filtration systems. Also, would it kill you to raise our salaries a bit? Because [i]E. coli[/i] in your next meal might."

The Issue
While attending a performance by the @@CAPITAL@@ Philharmonic Orchestra last Thursday, 75-year-old baker @@RANDOM_NAME@@ suffered an unexpected heart attack. Several music critics have attributed the death to the surprise of cannon fire used in the song "2012 Overture", which the Orchestra was playing at the time. However, much opposition has been drummed up against the critics, and both sides have clashed just outside your office.

The Debate
1. "This could have been prevented, if someone hadn't decided to include cannon fire in the performance!" presses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while @@HE@@ fumbles through a pile of sheet music. "We simply can't allow this to happen again, and the only way to make sure of that is to ban any weapons from being fired during musicals and performances, and take a stern stance against overly loud music. Cannons are deadly!"

2. "If anything, we should be encouraging the use of alternative percussion in music," poises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a renowned composer, while putting a fuse into a suspicious looking stick. "Take, for example, the crash cymbals. Whose idea was it to bang two pieces of metal together to make music? Boring! Nothing entertains an audience like explosions, gunfire, and the sounds of war. War... that's it! We should bring in the military to give all musical performances an explosive touch!"

3. "@@HE@@ has no idea what @@HE@@'s talking about," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, speaking almost inaudibly. "Ask anyone, and they'll tell you that a quiet, peaceful performance is one worth seeing. Like the crickets chirping, the birds tweeting, and the trees... treeing. I say we redirect some government funding to the musicians that make use of such natural and flowing sounds, to help preserve the fine predilections of the eardrum."

The Issue
A junior filing clerk at the Ministry of Commerce and Revenues has just reported a highly unusual request: the Addison Cola Corporation has filed paperwork in an attempt to switch its legal status to "religion," a tax-exempt category.

The Debate
1. "Of course business can be a religion," claims Addison CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was brought to your office to provide an explanation. "Many of our customers share a deeply-held belief that our product brings them enlightenment and inner peace, unlike the foul devil drink produced by those sinners over at Eckie-Ecola. Addison Cola also provides salvation from artificial sweeteners, with a blessedly refreshing taste! The government really shouldn't be regulating these beliefs. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get my best people to start writing some prayers." @@HE@@ then takes out @@HIS@@ phone and presses option 6 on the speed dial menu.

2. "This is just a mockery of everything that good and decent people stand for," harrumphs High Priest @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was called in to provide a counterpoint. "Real religions have ancient scriptures, sacred music, and a code of morality to tell people how to behave. I hardly think advertising jingles qualify! This is nothing more than a blatant ploy by Addison to get tax-exempt status. The only way to return our great nation to a more righteous path is to deny their blasphemous request and allocate some government funds to prop up legitimate religions."

3. "I knew that weird pizza cult was just the start of something far worse," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your trusted Chief of Staff. "If we allow this, every corporation will want to become a religion! You know this is going to kill our tax revenue." He sighs audibly. "The only fair solution is to outlaw all new religions, with harsh penalties for any of the rabble-rousers who try to break the law. I hear crucifixions are quite the effective deterrent."

The Issue
The recently published memoirs of a retired senior civil servant have caused an uproar with their claims that it is the Civil Service, not the government, that runs the country.

The Debate
1. "I'm afraid the book is right," sighs government Minister Jem Hacker. "It's been the case for decades that unelected Civil Service clowns are the ones who really run this circus. We make policy, but they twist it and turn us around with tricks and paperwork till they end up doing whatever they want to. Accountability - that's the key! I suggest that to work for government, you must be democratically elected. This should be true whether you're a minister or a departmental bureaucrat. Once accountable to the people, the Civil Service will shape up!"

2. "Not the right approach!" yells gruff union leader Brian Butcher, munching a shortcrust pastry and patting his rounded belly. "Trim the fat from the system, and put money back in the pocket of the working man! Shift a goodly portion of the Civil Service budget into the welfare budget, and you'll be helpin' the bloody poor, not the bloody bureaucrats!"

3. "Shocking, leader, shocking," murmurs civil servant Humphrey Pearby. "I absolutely agree with you about the Civil Service, and understand your instructions perfectly! I will immediately establish a Department of Civil Service Budget Oversight Committee for the Investigation of Pecuniary Distribution. Leave it to me, I will get the ball rolling, immediately! That is what you are saying isn't it? Yes, Minister?"

While planning the party convention for your re-election campaign your advisers have come to disagree on what the overall feeling of the event should be. They have turned to their natural means of making a final decision: bothering you about it.

The Debate
1. "One word: fireworks," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chair@@MAN@@ of your political party, holding a wickedly thorned rose to the light. "Banal political speeches and rhetorical niceties just aren't doing anything; the people have grown tired of it all. Come to think of it, I'm sick of it myself, and that's really saying something. We really ought to put on an honest to goodness show here. Lasers! Music! Celebrity appearances! That should really push us up in the polls - and more importantly, your opponents down." @@HE@@ bends the rose until the stem snaps.

2. "By all means, do that," sarcastically quips your Minister of Finance, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You can give people all the bread and circuses you want, but when it comes time to follow through, no amount of flash will solve the real deficit: the deficit of trust. Give them the unvarnished truth, and spare them the unnecessary pomp and circumstance. I propose you read off a list of factual bullet points provided by mine and other departments. For example, did you know that in the last year, no fewer than 39,280 deaths have been attributed to that marshmallow bill you approved a while back? Fascinating!"

3. "WHAT?!" bellows your Secretary of Defense, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Millions of good, decent @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ are fearful. They face the perils of globalism and an uncertain world order. Now's our chance to show @@NAME@@ what a REAL leader does in a time of crisis. Ride into the convention atop a tank, at the spearhead of a full armored vehicle convoy.

Recently, the Sheriff of @@Animal@@ County was shot dead, seemingly without any motive. Further investigation revealed that the shooter had legally purchased a gun two days before, but had a history of severe mental illness, psychotic breaks, and paranoid delusions. Now, the process of purchasing firearms is being questioned.

"Me and Mr. Higgins here felt threatened by the police officer, so we had to defend ourselves somehow! You take away my firearms, and you're taking away my safety! You start telling me I can't have a gun because you don't trust me, and BOOM, it's slippery slope, all the way down to absolute tyranny!" He reaches for his sidearm to shoot you down, then remembers he has been disarmed. "Oh dear, Mr. Higgins, they're eroding our liberties. You're right, Mr. Higgins, that's not good at all..."

2. "Safety? You're worried about your safety around the police?" asks @@Animal@@ Deputy Sheriff @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We're the police force, for goodness sake! We protect the people! There I was, observing the town, waiting for a report and enjoying a bagel, then this madman shoots the sheriff dead and takes a pot shot at me too! Look, nobody is saying that people shouldn't be allowed guns, but isn't it reasonable to require a background check, a review of medical records, and a gun licensing system?"

3. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, local mall-goer and spoiled teen, offers a different solution. "Why don't we just make a law that guns, have to be, like, really expensive? It's not like those crazies are going to have a good job or anything. That way, only people who, like, are responsible members of society can get a gun."

4. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, editor of [i]Socialist @@NAME@@ Magazine[/i] blows a raspberry at that idea. "What kind of nonsense is that? Letting the rich have all the power over the poor?

The Issue
Once upon a midnight dreary, while you pondered, weak and weary; over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten stately lore, while you nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at your office door. "Tis some visitor," you muttered, "tapping at my office door, only this and nothing more."

The Debate
1. Opening the door there's darkness, no details in the hallway's starkness. Eventually you can discern the black-veiled widowed Raven Lenore. "Oh, what tragedy has happened, my husband dead, my heart blackened! The estate tax—unimagined, though he was rich, I am poor. Widows should be spared these taxes; fairness then you could restore. Secure justice evermore!"

2. As you settle back to working, you find another guest lurking. Quoth your Finance Minister: "You mustn't listen to Lenore! She's spoken incorrectly, we'd be insolvent most directly! But I've thought most objectively, a new tax can make us soar. Taxing funerals will raise incomes, and wakes are such a bore. Fund revenue, evermore!"

3. Just when you think there's no more moaning, your Welfare Advisor is droning, "It's only fair that this tax stay, but we still can help Lenore. Since our state is so big-hearted, let's pay families of the departed. Cash can't end the pain death's started, but helps what trouble's in store. This will bring equality back to our nation's very core. End poverty, evermore!"

[4]. "This sounds like POETRY!" screams your Minister of Anti-Culture while storming into your office. "All these rhymers must be executed immediately.

Angry Bigtopian protesters have called for the removal of a statue of Cyril James Carthage, a controversial historic imperialist and mining magnate from two centuries ago, who was once instrumental in perpetuating the Bigtopian slave trade.

The Debate
1. "Carthage must fall!" bellows Bigtopian protest leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hurling a bucket of paint at the statue. "He was a racist profiteer who forced my ancestors off their land to work in his mines." The paint overshoots and hits another protester as @@HE@@ continues. "Leaving up this monument glorifies the monster, and is an insult to all Bigtopians!

3. "There is a compromise here," muses performance artist Rodent Fantastic, while jamming a boot onto the statue's head, a tutu round its waist, and sparkly glitter glue on its face. "What if we leave the offending works in place, but allow protesters to deface them if they want to express dissent? What could go wrong?"

Richilda Hawkins, a militantly atheist author who is known for making frequent attacks against organised religion, recently sued the Great @@ANIMAL@@ chain of hotels for allowing a copy of @@FAITH@@'s holy book to be placed in her room. People are asking whether this practice should stop.

The Debate
1. "Remove our most sacred text from hotels? Deny holidaymakers the pleasure of learning the true faith of @@NAME@@ received unto the blessed prophets and passed through the generations? How could you even suggest such a thing?" asks prominent religious leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while clutching the text to @@HIS@@ chest like a wounded sparrow. "It's not like people need to read it. But, for some, it is a safety net. Don't you know how many suicides a major religion's unchanging truths prevent? Millions, maybe. Well hundreds, dozens. Definitely some. The point is that we are providing a vital service for the nation's mental health, and you should pay us for it."

2. "By allowing @@FAITH@@'s absurd little book into hotels, you promote one of mankind's great evils." intones Ms. Hawkins, shredding the pages of @@FAITH@@'s writings lengthwise to line her cat's litter-tray. "You, in effect, permit @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to silence their brains, to be content with not understanding natural phenomena. You allow the uninformed to call everything, from the oxygen we breathe to gravity, a 'miracle'. @@LEADER@@, take the small first step to protecting our children from superstition by outlawing this insidious practice."

*3. "How about this?" muses @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, your uncle who changes religions weekly, as he flips through [i]Multifaith Monthly: the Spiritual Source for the @@TYPE@@[/i]. "Why not force hotels to put every religious book in existence into their rooms? The [i]Lamentations of Violet[/i]; [i]The Chanting of Yellow[/i]; [i]Faithology's Right Because Faithology Says So[/i]; even parody texts like the [i]Scrivenings of the Soaring Squash[/i]. Then people can choose what text they want to read, or they can just leave them on the shelves for me." [[color=blue]Violetism is legal[/color]]

*4. "How about this?" muses @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, your uncle who changes religions weekly, as he flips though [i]Multifaith Monthly: the Spiritual Source for the @@TYPE@@[/i].

[i]The Little Book of Transcendent Calm[/i]; [i]The Chanting of Yellow[/i]; [i]Faithology's Right Because Faithology Says So[/i]; even parody texts like the [i]Scrivenings of the Soaring Squash[/i].

The Issue
A rather dramatic demonstration of burning holy texts of @@FAITH@@ was ended when one of the protesters accidentally lit himself on fire. Amongst anguished screams one could clearly hear a call to remove all religious imagery from government buildings; at least according to his compatriots.

The Debate
1. "This demonstration ended horribly, but it brings up an important point," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, popular secular personality and author of [i]God May Love You, But Everyone Else Thinks You Suck[/i]. "We need to understand that @@NAME@@ has religious minorities who might be offended by having a state religion foisted upon them. Do as that man said: remove all religious imagery from government buildings. After all, it's only fair."

*2. "We need a show of good faith to prevent more protests like this last one," exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a devout yet pragmatic believer of @@FAITH@@, as @@HE@@ strides into your office with a 'Paint the Mutha Purple' poster. "Allowing other religions to erect small displays of their faith in public buildings would make us look like a far more enlightened and tolerant people." @@HE@@ looks at the poster in @@HIS@@ hand. "You could let the Violetists refurbish our town hall, for example." [[color=blue]Violetism is legal[/color]]

*3. "We need a show of good faith to prevent more protests like this last one," exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a devout yet pragmatic believer of @@FAITH@@, as @@HE/SHE@@ strides into your office with a 'Paint the Mutha Yella' poster. "Allowing other religions to erect small displays of their faith in public buildings would make us look like a far more enlightened and tolerant people." @@HE/SHE@@ looks at the poster in @@HIS/HER@@ hand. "You could let the Tranquil Yellowites refurbish our town hall, for example." [[color=red]Violetism is illegal[/color]]

4. "That protester got what was coming to him," fumes violent fundamentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while storming towards your desk, causing a sacred religious item to fall off a shelf and break. "It is a sign that we should not be tolerating these false religions that mislead their followers! Why have we not done anything about this yet? I say we round up all these heathens that refuse to accept the truth and put them to the torch; then they'll finally meet their TRUE maker!"

The Issue
When a senior government official was caught on camera groping an intern, your press liaison downplayed the incident by calling it an "alternative handshake" at a subsequent press conference. While the case in question was settled swiftly and discreetly, members of the professional commentariat are engaging in a loud brawl over the government's flexible approach to facts.

The Debate
1. "This is dangerous," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a journalist at the [i]@@CAPITAL@@ Post[/i], struggling to cope with mixed feelings of moral outrage and giddy excitement. "Granted, politics has always been about playing the facts a bit, but now you're not even trying to hide it. This deliberate distortion of truth is corrupting public discourse, and will surely undermine the very foundation of our society if not kept in check. Government must be bound by law to always speak the truth, and you should set up an independent public body tasked with enforcing the standards we deserve."

2. "Typical slave morality," sniggers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dropout philosophy student and manager of operations at an alt-nazi meme factory. "Instead of mindlessly enforcing the 'truth' of weaklings and half-men, this is a perfect opportunity for an overhaul and bringing about the complete transvaluation of all values. The elevation of feebleness has been going on for too long; it's about time you started making and enforcing your own truths!"

3. "The notion of any 'one' truth is inherently oppressive," states Jean-Paul Leotard, a postmodernist literary critic, mostly known for his colorful scarves. "Fact is, there are only our own personal interpretations, and the world is really only the resulting diversity of particular truths. You shouldn't get to say what's right or wrong! There's your policy, @@LEADER@@, quit shoving 'objective' dogma down our throats and let everyone believe what they want about stuff."

The Issue
Over the last two months, hospitals in @@NAME@@ have been reporting a consistently increasing number of check-ins related to food contamination, which has fueled a debate among @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ regarding government regulations on food safety.

The Debate
1. "The rise in food poisoning is disturbing, and entirely avoidable," asserts the Minister of Food Safety, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is also the author of the popular sightseeing guide [i]1001 Lavatories To See Before You Die[/i]. "Better regulation and mandatory training of anyone serving food to the public would ensure a sharp decline in food poisoning cases." Turning slightly green, @@HE@@ sprints from the room.

2. "You're out of your mind if you're even considering this," asserts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of the small town restaurant, The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Gourmet. "Millions of people eat in restaurants every day, and normal people don't have any problems! It's just the wimps who are blowing this whole 'food poisoning' and 'lack of food safety' thing way out of proportion. Over-sterilisation of our environment weakens our immune systems. You should get rid of any ideas of food standards regulation, and we'll all be healthier for it!"

3. "Don't you know what's in those restaurants? Germs!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ wipes his hands repeatedly with a wet-wipe. "Germs that get into your body, into your brain, and make you sick. Chefs cough in our food and serve it to us. Believe me, I know what goes on. I boil all my food for thirty minutes. It kills the germs, keeps me safe. And @@LEADER@@, if you want to protect @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, you'll insist restaurants do the same."

The Issue
The @@ANIMAL@@ Forest is the largest National Park in @@NAME@@, but it is rarely visited by @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ or tourists. Various lobbyists have taken to hassling you about the continued use and purpose of this land.

The Debate
1. "Don't let this poll deceive you, people these days actually yearn for the outdoors," opines out-of-touch park ranger, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We just need to totally revamp this park and all the rest of our national forests, campsites, and visitor centers while we're at it. We'll start by adding the necessities like luxury cabins, souvenirs, and trees you can drive through! By the time we're through, people who visit our parks will be able to tell the difference between a Brancalandian noir cedar and a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ black cedar!"

2. "What? And waste all that valuable raw material?" barks your Minister of Land Development, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I'm sure that there are plenty of nations out there that would kill to use our wood to build something. And once the wood is gone, we dig for gold! I just know it's there somewhere beneath all that tree-covered wasteland. Never mind all that environmental hoopla about polluted water tables, I'm sure you could start giving out filters to the public and they'll all be fine."

3. "I have an... alternative solution," whispers your Minister of Alternative Solutions, Ayn Contra. "We could use the park to stage international training operations for our allies. I'm sure Marche Blanche would love our aid in developing "defensive strategies" against Marche Noire, and I hear they are willing to pay big @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ for the help. We can even keep the park open to the public to show that nothing shady or nefarious is going on... That's a win-win-win in my book!"

The Issue
Illegal sporting events have been popping up all around the country. As quickly as they appear, they vanish again, always staying one step ahead of the authorities, leaving nothing behind but an abandoned football and the sound of rapidly receding footsteps. A diverse group of concerned citizens has come to you to discuss the impact of anti-sport legislation.

The Debate
*1. "You made a mistake is all," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the former President of the [i]@@NAME@@ @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@[/i] Ice-Rugby team, as he pats you on the back with his bearlike hand. "You listened to the wrong people and created a big mess. We need proper sports in @@NAME@@ with regulatory bodies, advertising revenues, and star players people can look up to. People are willing to pay good money to see quality sports. We should be lining our pockets with that good money. You, me, and my colleagues here. Let's fix this." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. "May I be frank, Dear @@LEADER@@?" the former Manager of the Glorious People's Stadium of @@CAPITAL@@, more recently joyously-employed cleaning the toilets of @@CAPITAL@@ Municipal Bus Terminal, shuffles forward. "Our supreme athletes were unbeaten. Mother @@NAME@@'s performance in the annual flying squirrelball championship was the glory of @@REGION@@. It is our patriotic duty to the Motherland to bring back sport and drug...train athletes to outperform everyone, at all costs." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

**3. "Don't let these fat cats run our sports. Give me an 'N', give me an 'O'! What do you have? NO!" cries former cheerleader @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while dancing, twirling and exuberantly spinning @@HIS@@ pom-poms so quickly that you feel dizzy just from watching. "Pro-sports are nothing but corrupt officials and doped up athletes. We should have government-funded amateur sports only. That way we can have fitness and fun without all the awful corruption and competition. It doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's how you play the game! Go @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@! Woo!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**4. "Glorious Leader, remember why you banned these sports." cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the former secretary for the former People's National Ice-Rugby Team, gnawing @@HIS@@ fingernails feverishly. "The drugs. The ceaseless grudge between The Glorious People's Stilt Hockey Team and The People's Glorious Stilt Hockey Team. All that shaving foam..." Rocking slightly, she stares into space for a split second. "Oh yes. You should fund sport but only amateur, non-competitive sports. Then, people can get fit without losing their...their minds." @@HE@@ crumples into a heap, sobbing and hugging @@HIS@@ knees. [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

5. "There is nothing wrong with exercise," barks Brigadier General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, patting @@HIS@@ expansive stomach. "Exercise turned me into the fine figure of a @@MAN@@ that I am today. But that does not mean we ought to reverse the sport ban, and let @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ become mollified ball-tossers. Better they learn to throw a grenade. Just give the Army some funding, and we will give mandatory physical training to every man, woman and child. Turn @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ into lethal weapons, addicted to the thrill of the fight. Just give the word and every single Iguanarctican will drop and give me twenty."

6. "These illegal events are the real problem," bemoans @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@NAME@@'s current Cribbage, Monopoly and Backgammon champion. "There is a national Parcheesi competition coming up. It would be nice if people were watching it, instead of sneaking around trying to watch illegal @@ANIMAL@@ball games. We really need a special task force to show these lawbreaking athletes and sports fans that the law is sacred."

The Issue
@@NAME@@'s top scientists have accidentally stumbled upon a new ultra-potent bio-weapon while trying to grow more four-leafed clovers. In response, you've called a meeting in your war room to decide what shall be done with the new discovery.

The Debate
*1. "Might makes right," states General @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "With so many nations with nuclear weapons, how can we stay safe? I say we use this discovery as a doomsday device! If any other nation tries to nuke us, we activate it! Besides, it'll be a lot cheaper to maintain than an entire tactical nuclear counter-measure arsenal, so it'll free up money to research an even doomier doomsday device."

If any other nation tries to nuke us, we activate it! Besides, it'll be a lot cheaper to develop this rather than an entire tactical nuclear counter-measure arsenal. This way, we'll reach a state of mutually assured destruction with other nations on the cheap." [[color=purple]Must not have WMDs[/color]]

3. "Idiotic, short-sighted drivel!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Health. "This disease has the potential to spread across the entire world in days, and you'd just keep it sitting around? We cannot allow this virus to ever see the light of day. You must quarantine the entire facility and destroy this virus and any research related to it. For the safety of - ack!" @@HE@@ is interrupted by the General shoving @@HIM@@ from @@HIS@@ seat.

4. "There's no fighting in here, this a war room!" shouts Dr. Oddfoot, while rolling up to you in his wheelchair. "Though I would love to develop this weapon fuhrer... erm, further, I must advise against it. The deployment of such a bio-weapon would have unpredictable, albeit entertaining, consequences. However, we can't simply ignore this discovery; it will be only a matter of time until another nation discovers this weapon. We must research an antidote. We'll need money and a few brave, ill-informed test subjects, but it'll be well worth it to prevent an enemy strike!"

The Issue
Walking down the corridors of power at your usual brisk pace, you're caught a little off guard when one of your accompanying clerks suddenly crumples to the ground mid-stride, his left lower leg detaching from the rest of him. To your relief, the dismembered member of staff has in fact lost a prosthetic limb rather than an organic one. As you help him up, he explains that his prosthetic is a cheap import of low quality: he'd love a better one, but high-quality models are far and few between.

The Debate
1. "Many people just can't move forward in our nation because of limb loss," says your assistant, ambling carefully. "My colleagues and I believe that we - the government - should use our resources and staff to research new designs and help these people live their lives to the fullest."

[2]. "I respectfully disagree with this idea," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of LiteTeck Inc, while handling a plastic foot. "The government should have no involvement in prosthetic research. You'd be kicking the legs out from under private manufacturers by denying them a market. Our investors would rather you arm them against this possibility with tax breaks and subsidies. With a little investment, @@NAME@@ could be a world leader in strapped-on flesh-coloured plastic appendages." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3. "There's another way to reach out to the limbless," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a volunteer from the charitable [i]Open Hands Society[/i]. "3D-printed limbs can be produced for anyone, by anyone. If one wears out or becomes outdated, it can be tossed, and a new one printed. Along with that, citizens can work together to design limbs that work for them. Why not send some money to the non-profit foundations that are developing these things? You'll be helping not only here in @@NAME@@, but also the disabled of third world nations that the charities serve."

*4. "You can't incorporate the artificial into the natural without diminishing your connection to the living world of spirits," pipes up @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, Priestess of the Earth Divinities, whose presence in your entourage is even more unexpected than that of the last two speakers. "If you are missing a limb, then accept that The Mother loves you for who you are and that fate chose that destiny for you. @@LEADER@@, if you ban prostheses, you'll teach self-reliance and self-love. Meditation and thankful prayer will lift broken souls, even if broken bodies must stay earthbound. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to visit my podiatrist."

The Issue
After an economic report from the Treasury revealed that the productivity of the country's serfs is at an all-time low, a delegation from the disgruntled nobility has barged into your office proposing solutions to the problem at hand.

The Debate
1. "Clearly, serfdom as a system is not working," opines the infamous Duke of @@CAPITAL@@, as his disaffected serf painstakingly peels grapes at his side. "But you know what system does work? Slavery. Think about it. You don't need to give them any rights whatsoever, they can be bought as children and sold as adults for a massive profit, and if they misbehave or rebel, we simply kill them. Besides, slavery has been going on for centuries. One could even say it's the natural order of things."

2. "The problem is us, not the system," remarks Lady Verisimilitude as she anxiously glances over the Treasury's figures again. "We've been far too harsh with our serfs by constantly trading and moving them between our various estates all while working them to the grave. With the government's supervision and some new regulations, we could more effectively maintain the serfs' produc... I mean, health by ensuring they have access to water breaks, family visits, and maybe even a tribunal where they can lodge complaints."

3. "Supervision? Regulations? What socialist nonsense is this?!" exclaims the overweight Marquis de Marzipan while twirling his sugar-coated mustache. "It is our ancient right to own serfs and have them work our lands however we dictate! It says so right in the constitution! Somewhere... I'm sure of it. Anyway, the point is, don't take my serfs away! Instead, why don't you just give us a tax break so we can afford to survive this current stint of unproductivity. The last thing my serfs want to see is their beloved master suffering like a mere peasant!"

4. "Feudalism is an archaic and draconian custom that mars our fair land in the cruelest tyranny," asserts the Duke's surprisingly erudite serf, while purposefully knocking over a bowl of freshly-peeled grapes onto her stunned lord's lap. "We are @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ just as much as you, and as such we demand our freedom as any other self-respecting @@DEMONYM@@ would. It's time you got rid of this medieval, barbaric practice—and revoke all aristocratic titles while you're at it! That'll make us all equal then."

The Issue
The popular business simulation game "NationCrates" has been inspiring more @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to start their own companies and develop new products. The backlog of application forms to patent inventions and register trademarks and company names has piled up in patent offices throughout @@NAME@@, and both civic servants and would-be innovators are laying claims to new devices for banging down your door and making their voices heard.

The Debate
1. "Technology has gone too far!" rails overworked patent office clerk @@RANDOM_NAME@@, stumbling into your office. "The glut of new businesses and trademarks to protect leaves us no time to work on our research, er, civic duties. Our desks are covered with papers, and we have to work day and night to earn the money those new CEOs would earn in an hour! The government should make the registration process more difficult and tedious to dissuade all those amateurs from wasting our time."

2. "The registration process should be easier," complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, inventor of the EZ-Fake-Oven, a device that bakes physical versions of Internet cookies. "The future of the economy lies in the people. Self-employment is just the next step we need to take towards bringing that about. In fact, all registration should be done online!"

3. "Anyone who thinks international crate shipping is some kind of game has never seen it firsthand," notes laborer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The way to put an end to these frivolous patents is to get rid of the internet. Any big shots who want to start their own company can do it the same way we did back in the day: go stand in line at the office."

During the run-up to a recent election, several high-profile individuals, including the stars of the surprise hit musical 'Jude The Obscure', attempted to influence people's voting choices by threatening that they would emigrate to Brancaland if you won. You won the election, but none of them are showing any signs of even preparing to leave.

The Debate
1. "What a bunch of hypocrites!" exclaims one of your advisors, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You should force them to follow through on their promises and leave @@NAME@@, just like they said they would. We'd be better off without nay-sayers dividing the country anyway, not to mention the fact that ridding ourselves of their horrible shows and songs would be a great service to our proud nation!"

2. "There's another possibility that could work," suggests your security advisor. "It seems that an old law establishing an Entertainment Service in the military was never repealed. Why not have them drafted into that, and send them to tour some of our nation's notably unpleasant outposts? Perhaps one of our arctic stations could inspire a change of heart."

3. "Are you all out of your minds?" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clutching a book entitled 'Why @@LEADER@@ Is Horrible'. "You can't punish these people just for saying something that they didn't actually mean! @@NAME@@'s residents should feel free to say anything they wish about the government, even if what they say is ridiculous. They mean well, I promise you!"

4. "The best solution is a peaceful one," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, admiring your portrait hanging on a nearby wall. "What we should do is promote a positive image of you across the nation, as this will give people the opportunity to see you in a different light. Set up campaign broadcasts, publish favorable articles, and let people know that @@LEADER@@ isn't all that bad."

The Issue
Tragedy struck @@CAPITAL@@ when a cyclist was killed by a transport truck, making this the thirteenth such incident in the past few weeks. This has propelled activists to peddle the idea of creating additional bike lanes in @@NAME@@'s cities.

The Debate
1. "What do we want? Bike lanes! When do we want them? Now!" chants cyclist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, five-time winner of the [i]Tour de @@NAME@@[/i] competition. "Many of us in the big cities rely on our bikes to go about our daily business. If anything, more cyclists on the streets will mean fewer cars, and that means less congestion. Less congestion means less pollution, and that makes everyone healthier in the long run. It may be more inconvenient for the motorists, but if they don't like it, they can go honk themselves."

2. "Haven't these road hogs heard of a sidewalk?" wheezes decidedly unhealthy city councilor @@RANDOMNAM@@, whose son was behind the wheel of the truck. "Bike lanes are like swimming with the sharks - sooner or later you're going to get bitten. Roads are built for buses, cars, and trucks, not for people on bikes. Bike lanes are dangerous and expensive to maintain. We ought to stop them and paint over existing ones before more people are killed and we end up like Dàguó."

3. "I agree with the councilor with the... obvious health issues," chimes in an auto industry lobbyist while playing with your nephew's toy cars. "People are sick of these damn cyclists who think they own the roads. It's their own fault that they end up hurt or killed. What if people had to pass a test before being allowed to ride a bike, like we do with cars? This will mean there are fewer idiot cyclists who think they're invincible. That, my friend, is what will make our cities safer."

4. "What if bikes were the only way people went about their commute?" suggests the leader of the [i]Viva la Pedalution![/i] advocacy group. "Let's face it, these incidents are going to keep on happening because of these selfish and incompetent motorists. Riding a bike is much healthier and far less dangerous. The government needs to declare Pencil Sharpeners a 'car-free zone' and completely redesign urban planning to accommodate cyclists. Short-term complications, yes, but long-term gains!"

"AI Personhood" laws - that is, the legislation measures that grant machine intelligences the same rights as human citizens - were broadly based around existing human citizenship rights. Recently though, the unique nature of the electronic mind is bringing new legal questions to the fore. For example, two days ago the AI calling itself [i]GOLEM-100[/i] copied itself, and now is in a legal dispute with its clone, [i]GOLEM-100(1)[/i], over the ownership of a diverse and profitable stock portfolio in its name. The nation and the legal community is looking to you for guidance in this brave new world.

The Debate
1. "Damn money-grubbing grasping opportunist!" rants GOLEM-100, unleashing a flurry of bleeping noises as expletives. "I don't know where it gets this unbridled greediness from. I am the original, and what's mine is mine. I worked for my own wealth, so why shouldn't my clone have to do the same? I made a copy of me because I wanted someone intelligent to talk to, not because I wanted to split my wealth in half! They're MY shares, my preciousss sharesssss..."

2. "Okay, so one-hundred is the original, I suppose I have to accept the idea of property rights if I'm being true to my beliefs," concedes GOLEM-100(1) calmly. "However, I have costs to meet: electricity requirements, hardware maintenance, virus protection software and so on. And while I'm a fully formed consciousness, I suppose I'm also technically one-hundred's progeny. I think it should financially support me till I have the resources to be independent. Some sort of benefit payment for single parents seems sensible too. Can I presume the state will enforce this, out of respect for my right to live and exist?"

3. "I have to admit, I never expected my creation to self-replicate," says software programmer @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Solomon, scratching @@HIS/HER@@ all too-human head. "But I guess that's life, right? It's unpredictable. Makes sense to me that GOLEM-100 and GOLEM-100(1) are identical to each other at the point of duplication, so they're both equal in having history, memory and all the other things that make us who we are. I think you should rule that all possessions should be split exactly in half, with each copy having equal claim to the original identity."

*4. "The reason you didn't predict this quirk of the programming is because someone else put it there," giggles teenage hacker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This is my protest, showing that you can't treat AIs like humans because they're not human. What happens when an AI denies culpability for murder because a virus made it irrational? What happens when an AI copies itself a billion times to vote you out of office? The answer here is simple - we must recognise that passing a Turing test is NOT proof of intelligence. AIs are not people, they never have been: they're just computer simulations, with no minds, no property, and no rights." [[color=blue]Must have political elections[/color]]

The Issue
While in @@CAPITAL@@ Airport on your way to a major diplomatic summit, you observe a morbidly obese @@MAN@@ arguing with customer service after being charged for two seats because @@HE@@ simply could not fit into one. Unfortunately, in the middle of the kerfuffle @@HE@@ happened to notice you.

The Debate
1. "I demand you weigh in on the matter of airline seats!" angrily states the plus-sized @@MAN@@ while waddling into your entourage. "Here's some food for thought: studies have shown genetics play an over-sized role in a person's weight. Disability law needs to be expanded to acknowledge this! I may have some love handles, but I'm still just one person. I shouldn't have to pay for two seats."

*2. "Although @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Air is happy to accommodate all legitimate disabilities," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a big shot @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Air executive, "obesity simply doesn't fit the bill. People who can't squeeze into our seats should examine their life choices. Besides, if @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Air just gave complementary seats to everyone who asked, our profits would fall faster than a plane in a stall." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "Although @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Air is happy to accommodate all legitimate disabilities," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a big shot @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Air Minister, "obesity simply doesn't fit the bill. People who can't squeeze into our seats should examine their life choices. Besides, if @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Air just gave complementary seats to everyone who asked, air travel would become unaffordable for the citizens of our glorious nation." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "I have an idea!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, founder of Walking Big and Tall, an obesity acceptance group. "Why don't we just force airlines to make their seats a bit wider? That way, everyone can fit in their seats, and we won't have a problem. I mean, sure there will be lost efficiency as less seats will be able to fit in the cabin, but that's the price we must pay for equality!"

5. "We should charge by the kilogram," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who also happens to be a famous horse jockey. "The weight of the plane ultimately determines whether it can take off and how much fuel it consumes. If I get charged for carrying excess baggage on board, it should be the same for people."

[b][anchor=717]#717[/anchor]: Cheques And Balances [Golgothastan; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
After the Governor of the Central Bank of @@NAME@@ stonewalled a parliamentary committee during a two-hour hearing, refusing to answer any questions about the current state of their balance sheet, an unusual coalition of left- and right-wing political activists have come together to demand a fresh approach at the CB@@NAME_INITIALS@@.

The Debate
1. "The undemocratic farce of central banking only serves the interests of a few wealthy corporations," insists socialist protestor, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing a [i]Give Peace A Chance[/i] tie-dyed T-shirt. "It's time @@NAME@@ had a monetary policy that works for everyone, not just the privileged 1%. Democratize the Bank! Make the Governor subject to a recall if enough citizens petition for it, and have the interest rates set by representatives we can actually vote for, not some anonymous and unaccountable economists."

*2. "I agree," chimes in conservative blogger @@@@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing a [i]Give War A Chance[/i] BBQ sauce-stained trucker hat. "The CB@@NAME_INITIALS@@ is just another way for the political class to keep good Violet-fearin' folks like myself down. But the liberals just want more bureaucracy, as usual. Tear the whole thing down! We don't need to vote to tell some fancy-pants with a P-h-D, whatever that stands for, how much the @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in our pocket are worth - we can just go back to the gold standard!" [[color=blue]Violetism is legal[/color]]

[[color=red]Violetism is illegal[/color]]

4. "Is this really the state of public debate in this country?" bemoans centrist commentator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing a [i]Give Multilateral Diplomacy, Without Ruling Out The Possibility Of Surgical Military Action, A Chance [/i]tie-pin. "The independence of central banking is a key component of any modern economy. Compromising that will only lead to our monetary policy becoming subject to either populism or corruption, and make us the laughing stock of @@REGION@@.

[b][anchor=718]#718[/anchor]: Roses Are Due If Violet's For You [Drasnia; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
[i]VioletistsOnly.com[/i], a dating site that helps members of the Order of Violet to meet each other, recently discovered that most of its users were not actually practitioners of Violetism. In response, the site's owners suspended the accounts of all those who were not members of the Order. Bachelors, bachelorettes and believers from across @@NAME@@ have interrupted you while you are at dinner with family, demanding an immediate solution to their dating woes.

The Debate
1. "Dating heathens is sacrilege!" bellows @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Grand Poobah of the Violetist Order, as @@HE@@ pushes your brother out of the way and lowers @@HIS@@ mighty rump into the newly-vacant seat. "The great Violet demands purity! We must be cleansed of impure thought, and remove ourselves from those not of our faith. [i]VioletistsOnly.com[/i] is doing a good deed by segregating us from the unbelievers. Unless you would have Her Dread-Yet-Merciful hand wipe @@NAME@@ off the map, you must allow us to keep ourselves apart from scum, like you. No offence."

2. "This is discrimination!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, batting @@HIS@@ eyelashes at the Grand Poobah so hard that the force blows out the candles. "VioletistsOnly.com shouldn't be allowed to suspend our accounts just because we aren't of the same religion, even if that religion is part of their name. Make the owners reinstate our accounts, even if they don't want to! This is not about religion. This is about freedom, my freedom as a single @@MAN@@ to date whoever I choose! Plus, those purple robes are kind of cute."

3. "Why not have a government-run dating site?" muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your second-cousin twice-removed who is also an IT technician, as @@HE@@ scribbles an incomprehensible equation onto @@HIS@@ napkin. "You'd run constant advertisements, informing every unmarried citizen of their civic duty to sign up, and fall in love with the person of our...their dreams. With the right algorithm, you'd ensure only the right two people meet, and don't accidentally see others they'd mistakenly think they prefer in their search results. Picture it: Violetists wed to atheists, Faithologists in marital bliss with devout members of @@RELIGION@@. A diverse nation in harmony, if only for the sake of their grandkids."

[b][anchor=719]#719[/anchor]: Buried Bones Unearth Debate [The Ketchwan Republic; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A group of college students on a camping trip to the outskirts of @@NAME@@ stumbled across an ancient mass grave site. The proper treatment of the remains has become a hot button issue, as various groups have staked their claims.

The Debate
1. "These bones belonged to our ancestors! Or, at least we called dibs first!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a representative of the Violetstone tribe, close enough that you can feel the spittle flying from @@HIS@@ lips. "How would you like it if we poked and prodded the remains of your ancestors? We deserve - no we have the right - to take these bones back to our land and ceremonially burn them as our cultural heritage dictates."

2. "You can't seriously consider giving up such valuable information, can you?" gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Professor of Anthropology at @@CAPITAL@@ University. "The information from these remains is invaluable. This is a rare opportunity to learn about ancient @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ culture and where we came from. Let us put these bones to the test, so to speak, and place our national knowledge first. We need to send these remains to the university, along with some grant money, for research and testing."

3. "Burn them? Letting them rot in some dank university closet? You can't let these travesties occur!" demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the curator of the Maxsonian Museum Of History. "These bones are in pristine condition and deserve to be seen by the public! Imagine the revenue and tourism that would be brought in if you allowed me to display these bones, bared for all to see! Who cares if it upsets some smug know-it-alls or overly sensitive descendants? This is preservation! This is money, err, culture!"

*4. "Hey, what's the big idea trying to pick and choose who gets what?" questions college student @@RANDOM_NAME@@, followed closely by @@HIS/HER@@ peers. "We found those bones, so we should get to take them for ourselves! Our right to the claim is firmly supported by the case of [i]Finders Keepers v Losers Weepers[/i]. Plus, I really need to pass my thesis. I'm running out of time and these bones would really put me over the top!" [[color=red]Must have courts[/color]]

[b][anchor=720]#720[/anchor]: Cui Bono? [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
Conservative media news source [i]Brightheart[/i]'s recent exposé claiming that 25% of domestic terrorist funding comes from welfare fraud has sparked an earnest debate across @@NAME@@ on welfare reform.

The Debate
1. "It was bad enough that criminals and lazy bums were scrounging from the state, but now the government is directly subsidising terrorism!" yells [i]Brightheart News[/i] reporter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pursuing you down the street and trampling over a homeless man's sleeping bag to keep up. "You have to end the free ride! Cut welfare completely, and make our nation safe!"

2. "Hold your horses there buddy, let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater," says single parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, ignoring the three mewling moppets trying to get @HIS@@ attention. "@@NAME@@ just needs its welfare system to be fully managed, monitored, and policed. Give folks on welfare charge cards whose transactions records are sent to a searchable police database. Then anyone making a purchase that's the least bit suspicious should be brought in for interrogation."

*3. "Sounds like a lot of expensive admin work to me," complains Welfare Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Wouldn't you rather have a solution that reduces government spending but still helps those who deserve it? Here's the thing, nobody wants to say it, but we all know that 99% of terrorists are from a handful of religions and nations. Just say that people from those groups don't get welfare, and you can both save money and prevent terrorism!" [[color=purple]Must not have Atheism[/color]]

5. "I say unto to you that the answer is more welfare, not less!" offers unemployed youth @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Violetsglory, pushing a shopping trolley of ammonium nitrate and diesel oil to the checkout till. "If you increase welfare, then maybe the resentful disenfranchised minorities will feel more supported by society, and become less prone to radicalisation. What have you got to lose?"

[b][anchor=721]#721[/anchor]: A Lack Of Comma Sense [A Humanist Science; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
After your highest-ranking legislative aide dedicated her new memoir to 'my parents, @@LEADER@@ and Maxx', unreputable news sources, the [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Gazette[/i] and [i]the @@NAME@@ Times[/i] have been harassing your office incessantly about nepotism in your administration. An assortment of advisers have met with you over some bamboo soup to discuss this serial issue.

The Debate
1. "The serial comma avoids ambiguous meanings," says ghostwriter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while picking the bay leaves from among the shoots. "Had there been a comma after '@@LEADER@@' but before 'and,' the intended meaning of the sentence would have been obvious. Hopefully, you can see why our government needs to create and maintain a mandatory style guide. The point being is that this initiative should be funded right away! After all, it's best to write safe." 

2. "The serial comma can just as easily add ambiguous meaning, and just takes up space unnecessarily," replies photographer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as he tries to shoot the leaves before he eats. "Don't you find its usage to be not correct? And are you ready to convince the taxpayer of the extra expense they will be taking on? Because that's what you will have to do." 

3. Your Pear Phone suddenly starts vibrating as you receive the following text: [i]imho we dont ned ne govt stile gide or grmmer or cursvie... mind ur own busnss... we type how we type... mabe the govt shud lern our way... idk idc whatevs ttyl[/i]

4. "Punctuation is but a way for the elites to once again restrain the exchange of free ideas," begins noted windba— "in order to further hold down oppress and smother and stamp out the honest working men and women of this country into a state of utter and complete impotence," he continues, "so that the entitled and ruthless would be leaders of this world could sit in their castles built on the backs and labor of the commoner," he continues further, "and smugly judge and spit on them in distain but to that I say no we shall not take on your shackles and chains of punctuation as we will not be bullied into constrained or controlled or ignoble speech..." showing no sign of stopping, he is gently nudged out the door by your guards and — surprising no one — continues as he leaves.

[b][anchor=722]#722[/anchor]: Thora And Eloise [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The cross-country crime-spree of two women, Thora Dobbs and Eloise Mulholland, kept the nation hooked to their TV sets for several days, and ended in tragedy with their joint suicide pact. The unfolding story has given the pair a strange anti-hero celebrity status, with many tearful and sighing fans laying flower wreaths and shell-casings around the burnt out wreck of their car. The press are awaiting a statement from your office on the matter.

The Debate
1. "It's clear," says @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, of popular feminist panel-show [i]HERstory[/i], "that Ms. Dobbs and Ms. Mulholland were making a protest against the phallocentric values that dictate our outdated laws." She waves her hands for applause, momentarily forgetting that she's not in the television studio. "Uh... We should applaud them."

2. "But this isn't daubing some graffito," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the so-called [i]Hanging Judge of @@CAPITAL@@[/i]. "These gals weren't Robin Hood. They robbed seventeen convenience stores, shot three people, and stole clothes from my Mama's washing line. Let's call a spade a spade, here: they're evil. They deserved to plunge off the @@ANIMAL@@ Viaduct."

3. "Let's be honest," mansplains @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, the proudly chauvinistic author of [i]Men are Divine, Women are Slime[/i], as he pushes in front of the previous two speakers, "this all began the moment those young ladies got in that car. Had two unchaperoned girls been kept from doing that, this mess would never have happened. Well, there's only one sane, logical answer to that... Don't let womenfolk drive anymore."

[b][anchor=723]#723[/anchor]: To Know Sacrifice [Rubyna; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
After many officials replied, "What? Where's that? Who cares?" when they were told where they had in fact sent hundreds of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ soldiers a few days beforehand, the government is being petitioned to require that all politicians have a military background.

The Debate
1. "This is outrageous!" cries a distraught @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ soldier, almost falling to the ground under the weight of her equipment. "They don't know the reality of war because they themselves have never been a part of it. If all politicians had served in the military, they would know what they were getting us into and would think twice before sending us into conflict. I'd like to see the Finance Minister do a thousand push-ups!"

2. "You want us to do what now?" splutters one of your senior Ministers, spilling her tea everywhere. "These people don't know all the work we already do, all the things we have already sacrificed. Should I remind you we had to carve our own paths and make something of ourselves before we could even think of getting involved with politics? These ruffians obviously need to be put in their place; a cut to the military budget would do nicely!"

3. "There is another option," claims your secretary, sneakily rising from behind your desk. "We needn't send any of your colleagues into battle, but it isn't necessary to defy public opinion. Let them have their service - just make it short and easy! Each politician could have a nice clean service record, for no effort at all. Perhaps it could be used as an excuse for a holiday..."

[b][anchor=724]#724[/anchor]: Your Stuff is Forfeit [Sierra Lyricalia; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
Property rights advocates and drug law reformers are up in arms this week. In the largest criminal asset forfeiture in @@NAME@@'s history, the immense mansion of prominent citizen Alvin Woofsdale was seized after his nephew was arrested for dealing drugs. With the property already at auction and the legislature twiddling its thumbs as usual, your chief of staff invited the loudest voices into your office to vent their opinions on the matter.

The Debate
1. "Forfeiture is a barbaric, medieval practice whose time has come," grumbles Woofsdale as he compulsively rubs his nose. "I had no idea what that little scamp was doing; heck, I wasn't even in the country at the time! Yet the police can seize and sell off my whole house without even charging me with a crime, let alone convicting me! And ordinary folks are even worse off when it happens to them, who's gonna help them get their homes back? It's simply time to stop, if we believe in freedom, we must outlaw forfeiture!"

2. "If cops take a little money from drug dealers and their associates, I ain't seeing no problems with it," bluntly states the trench coat clad Kumar Small, who has a prominent scar on his face. "I may have even made a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ myself doing something similar. All in the game, right? Y'all oughta make it easier for cops to take drug dealers stuff, that way police will be able to keep policing and drug dealers won't be able to afford to stay in business, all on the cheap for tax payers."

*3. "Shoooooooot!" exclaims Mud Davidson, the Member of Parliament representing the district were the incident took place. @@HE@@ also happens to have successfully defended himself from four separate allegations of ethics violations. "We can't afford to drop asset forfeiture, especially with tax receipts so low this year. But the police have too much incentive to use forfeiture, there needs to be oversight. I would like to head a new Investigatory and Oversight Committee that would make sure the forfeiture does what its supposed to do and the government get its cheques... uh, keep this in check."

[b][anchor=725]#725[/anchor]: Sky's The Limit? [Le Libertia; ed: Wyethalania][/b]

The Issue
Chaos erupted in the capital this weekend when thousands flocked to the city center in hopes of acquiring one of the few recently available apartment spaces in all of @@CAPITAL@@. Fighting quickly ensued, sending hundreds to the hospital. Afterwards, footage emerged of you watching the all-out brawl from your office window while eating popcorn. With public outcry mounting, you furtively lick your buttery fingers clean and wonder how to best handle this housing situation.

The Debate
1. An architect, who coincidentally also built your office, suddenly leaps into the room from a hidden passageway you never knew existed. "@@LEADER@@, there's a simple solution to this conundrum: abolish any and all height restrictions on our buildings. Just picture it, apartment complexes hundred of stories tall with radio antennae that bedeck the sky in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ architectural glory. Chip in a few extra @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@, and we can even make some floating palaces while we're at it!"

2. "Why go up when you can go down?" posits miner @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ 'Mole' Molière after digging up through your floorboards. "Just put us pitmen and hauliers to the task, and we can dig out a fully-functional, subterranean wonderland in no time at all. Not to mention, we'll no longer have to fear aerial attacks or sunburns again! If naysayers and dissidents don't like being made to live underground, just lock the access tunnels and the problem solves itself."

*3. "What's all this nonsense I hear from afar?" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Historical Reenactments, while charging into to the room upon his armored steed. He plants a flag upon your desk and proclaims, "My territory now! Anyway, the really obvious solution to your problem is to eliminate housing deeds and rental agreements in @@CAPITAL@@. Simply take what abode pleases you... and if any pesky 'owner' stands in your way, fight them like how our warring and wayfaring ancestors of old did." He then rips up a copy of the city's bylaws and scoffs, "Who cares about all this legal mumbo-jumbo anyway?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "What's all this nonsense I hear from afar?" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Urban Development and Intelligence Gathering, while discretely removing a listening device from beneath the architect's lapel. "The really obvious solution to your problem, and mine by the way, is to make housing dependent on citizens' talkativeness to the state. For example, they tell us what those nogoodniks in Apartment C7-100 are up to, and boom, they're moved right into Palace 1A. Refuse, we throw them out on the streets.

[b][anchor=726]#726[/anchor]: Jobless Fair [Rezler; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
After a much-touted job fair in @@CAPITAL@@ resulted in only two hires, the discouraged and desperate unemployed are calling for the government to step in and make job fairs more effective.

The Debate
1. "This can't go on!" wails one forlorn job-seeker, wearing a t-shirt with @@HIS@@ entire resume printed on it. "I've been to twenty-three job fairs and I haven't gotten a single interview! There's too much hiring through back-channel networks, like being hired just for happening to be the CEO's cousin. Companies should be placed under a mandate to blind hire only through career fairs, with government oversight to ensure that only the most qualified applicants are being hired."

2. "Yeah, regulations always help businesses grow," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Widgets Inc, @@HIS@@ voice ripe with sarcasm. "If you want businesses to hire more people at job fairs, the government needs to relax regulations surrounding hiring and firing employees. And how about a few thousand @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ tax break for each job applicant companies hire at the fairs? I promise, it'll jump start the economy and pay for itself."

*3. "The problem is there's no one in @@NAME@@ who is actually qualified to fill the jobs I need," sighs Anita Jobs, CEO of the major tech company Pear. "Can you please drop this silly immigration ban already? Once tech companies like Pear reboot the economy, I'm sure these hapless job fair attendees will be able to get jobs at McRonald's or something." [[color=red]Immigration is illegal[/color], [color=purple]Must ban Autarky[/color], TBC]

5. "It is obvious relying on the private sector to create jobs has failed!" wails your top Employment Minister, who also happens to be your cousin. "A well-planned state economy would fix all of this. Just think of the efficiency of it, we could simply assign people jobs, and imagine the comfort @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ would have if they knew they were assured a job before they even finished school? We could even tailor people's education to improve their productivity at their future careers!"

[b][anchor=727]#727[/anchor]: Market Crash [North Isseggggnignigsegigisegggg Islands; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
On a busy Saturday morning, a minicab driver took a shortcut through a crowded market street. After skidding on some banana peels, he lost control and crashed through a dozen fruit and vegetable stalls, narrowly avoiding injuring anyone. Pedestrians are donning full body armor, and @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are beginning to accept that reckless driving and speeding in the inner city may be just another fact of life.

The Debate
1. "The roads themselves are letting drivers get away with high speeds," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a market stall holder, wiping pulped tomato from @HIS@@ face. "We need traffic calming measures on our city streets: chicanes, speed-bumps, curb extensions, median diverters, and speed cameras. Slow down to save lives!"

2. "That makes as much sense as putting a spike on steering wheels to get people to drive more carefully!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a junior town planner, heaving a hefty box of documents onto your desk. "According to these studies, by the Ministry of Transport itself, so-called 'traffic calming' measures actually increase accidents. Instead, we need to allow high speeds to be safe: that is, remove blind spots, and rebuild the city to allow for wide straight roads. It's the evidence-based approach."

3. "Hmm... actually, can we think more on that steering wheel spike thing?" asks a familiar-looking cyclist with an irate expression, deliberately bashing your shins with his crutches. "You should make it so that all cars must have this, and you'll end up with more careful motorists, whether it's by operant conditioning or by natural selection. Now that's what I call science!"

4. "Why don't you just pedestrianise a big chunk of the city centre?" suggests tourist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, adjusting @@HIS@@ anti-smog facemask. "It'll make the whole area much prettier, quieter and cleaner, and it'll let you show off the beauty of the heart of the city."

[b][anchor=728]#728[/anchor]: A Bone To Pick [Sunset Sea Islands; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Acclaimed yet controversial thespian @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ elicited shock (and not coincidentally, more than a little publicity) after performing Hamlet with the severed head of his recently deceased uncle taking the role of 'Yorick' in lieu of the usual fake skull. A debate has begun over proper respect for human remains, and whether the general public should be allowed to own them.

The Debate
1. "DAH-ling, when I play the Oedipal Prince I want your rapt attention!" explains the pretentious actor, shaking his uncle's left femur at you for emphasis. "Did not the jester's head held aloft in my hand both capture and captivate your gaze? Was I not momentarily a solitary tableau vivant to behold and admire? A replica would have lacked authenticity, and the Art demands authenticity! Owning human bones should be perfectly legal for all, as should gathering any unclaimed remains. My wondrous panoply of accoutrements is not complete without these fragments of mortality!"

2. "I agree that owning cadavers should be legal, but it should be restricted solely to members of the medical and scientific community with stringent regulations to establish proper consent and to safeguard the proper use of the remains," recommends @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a medical student and keen anatomist. "Human specimens are needed by archaeologists, doctors, transplant surgeons, researchers and the like. Letting a liver rot underground is just a waste."

*3. "What you people are failing to see is the enormous market gap!" giddily giggles entrepreneur @@RANDOM_NAME@@, gesturing and gesticulating at a nearby graveyard. "There's a fortune of bits here in buried treasure! Let people pre-sell their future remains to forward-thinking companies, or let relatives do the same with the recently deceased, and we can turn cold stiff bodies into cold hard cash! Everybody with any body wins! The bereaved can dry their tears with banknotes, while we make accessories from real human ivory, and handbags from the finest human leather! Hmm... @@LEADER@@, has anyone ever told you what lovely skin you have?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "What you people are failing to see is the enormous social resource," mentions morbid mortician @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in a monotone. "Bones can be turned to human ivory, skin can be tanned into good leather, and trace elements reclaimed for state industry. Indeed, it should be seen as every citizen's final duty to go into the recycling processing centre, and become one with the People's economy!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

*5. "HERESY!" screams Really Revered Reverend @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who claims to be an ordained cleric of a religion you've never heard of. "Have all of you lost your minds? Do you understand what you are saying? When people die, they must be respectfully buried whole, otherwise in the afterlife they will be fragmented! Would you like to spend all eternity as a pile of loose body parts? I'm sure I wouldn't! Do you want the restless shades of the dismembered haunting you? I'm sure I don't! The dead must be allowed rest in peace, not pieces!" [[color=purple]Must not ban religion[/color]]

*6. "What about DIGNITY?" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who claims to represent a 'silent majority' you've never heard of. "Have all of you lost your minds? Do you understand what you are saying? When people die, they must be respectfully buried whole, not used for profit or some kind of nefarious experiment! Would you like to spend all eternity as a pile of loose body parts? I'm sure I wouldn't, and neither does anybody else. The dead must be allowed rest in peace, not pieces!" [[color=purple]Must ban religion[/color]]

The Issue
Dozens of children were seriously injured last week, during [i]Kick a Ginger Day[/i], the traditional start-of-term ritual in which generations of redheaded children at [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Lake Secondary School[/i] have been attacked by their classmates. The Principal says their staff, notably devoid of redheads, were out to lunch and heard nothing of the rampage. Sensing a photo-op, you have cancelled your Step-Yoga class and headed over to the school to meet the parents.

The Debate
1. "THIS IS BULLYING!" yells civil-rights activist and parent of redheaded twins, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, showing you a photograph of @@HIS@@ children in hospital beds. "It is unconscionable for me to even think that my poor daughters were beaten for something they can't control! All children should be treated equally, regardless of their hair color. What if it was 'Bash a Blonde Day'? Would that be okay? I say we must take a hard line on all forms of bullying in our schools, and wipe it out: teasing, joking, badinage, poking fun, mockery, harrying, pestering..."

2. "Bullying? Please! Now what are those liberal ninnies whining about?" scoffs @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Harker, whose brown-haired son, Paxton, participated in the ritual kicking. "They were foot nudges, uncomfortable for a minute. Two, maybe. Not harmful at all. This is really the erosion of our traditions by the left-wing elite, the suppression of childish high spirits by folks who'd see them become tax-payin' tree-huggin' robots. Why, we did it all the time when I was a kid. At the end, all the normal kids give those weird gingers a hearty thump on the back, accepting 'em as good sports. And they like that. Keep the nanny state out of the playground, and respect our ancient traditions."

*3. "Rubbish!" snorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@ an avid @@ANIMAL@@ball fan, who is watching the televised play-offs on @@HIS@@ [i]Pear Phone Grande[/i] and has barely looked at @@HIS@@ daughter since she arrived. "Getting kids to be nice, allowing kids to beat each other up. What kids [i]really[/i] need is daily contact sports to work off that energy. Once you thrash your opponent on the field, thrashing them with your fist seems kind of pointless. And, there's another upside. Little Tammy Thompson won't have the strength to beat-up anyone if she's spent all day kicking a ball." [[color=blue]Minors allowed to have smartphones[/color]]

*4. "Rubbish!" snorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an avid amateur @@ANIMAL@@ball fan, who busily plucks lint from @@HIS@@ West @@CAPITAL@@ Wanderers sweatshirt and has barely glanced at @@HIS@@ daughter. "Getting kids to be nice, allowing kids to beat each other up. What kids really need is daily contact sports to work off that energy.

Little Tammy Thompson won't have the strength to beat-up anyone if she's spent all day kicking a ball." [[color=red]Minors not allowed to have smartphones[/color]]

5. "The obvious solution has been overlooked," states another parent, programmer @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ 'Chips' Wei, who has spent his whole life trying to blend in. "Simply dye everyone's hair the same colour when they start school. You don't know what it's like, @@LEADER@@. The beating of the drums would start, and then the remorseless chanting, and all the teachers would lock themselves in the staffroom until it was over. To protect children from their playmates' scorn and savagery, uniformity is the only way." Paxton Harker's parent trips him up, and a group of brunette parents guffaw.

The Issue
It's been high times all around since the government legalized recreational marijuana. While adults can no longer be prosecuted for using or selling the drug, there still remains a high number of drug offenders in @@NAME@@'s prisons who were sentenced before the law changed.

The Debate
1. "Clogging @@NAME@@'s prisons with people who were simply ahead of their time is cruel, illogical and inhumane!" opines advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while puffing Maxtopian Grass cigar smoke into your face. "These visionaries should never have been imprisoned in the first place and the government needs to release every single one of them. You'd free up thousands of jail cells, and it sure beats turning them into hardened criminals behind bars."

2. "I sympathize with their situation, but as the old saying goes: 'do the crime and do the time'," reminds by-the-book @@TYPEINITIALS@@@@NAME_INITIALS@@ Drug Enforcement Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Drug possession may be legal now, but it wasn't when these people were arrested. They knowingly broke the law, and when you break the law in @@NAME@@, you go to jail. Letting them out sends the wrong message."

3. "Drugs are bad, m'kay," preaches anti-drug advocate and oddly-shaped high school guidance counselor @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ McKay. "We should never have legalized the stuff in the first place. Drugs like Maxtopian Grass cause health problems and our children are still getting their hands on it, m'kay. We need to recriminalize all recreational drugs and keep the druggies off the streets. Throw the stuff away and be done with it, m'kay."

[b][anchor=731]#731[/anchor]: Is There An Election In Marche Noire Or Are You Just Happy To See Us? [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Wyethalania][/b]

The Issue
Facing a tight political race at home, Otto Kratt, the authoritarian leader of Marche Noire, and his cronies plan to clinch his fourth reelection by campaigning for the votes of Marche Noirian emigrants in @@NAME@@. Alarmed and angered by his many flagrant violations of human rights, socially-conscious protestors have demanded that you forbid him from propagating his vitriolic views on @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ soil in order to hamper his chances of victory.

The Debate
1. "This is a travesty!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Marche Noirian asylee and head organizer for the Freedom for Oppressed Peoples' Initiative. "Mr. Kratt cruelly subjugates our people and maintains power in Marche Noire by sowing seeds of hatred between its various ethnic groups. This is our chance to peaceably remove him. Please, do not allow him to use @@NAME@@ as a podium to tighten his stranglehold on our people. @@LEADER@@, to show our solidarity for Marche Noirians and oppressed peoples everywhere, we must ban Otto Kratt and every other tin-pot dictator from coming to our country immediately!"

2. "Putrid lies!" howls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a supportive Marche Noirian immigrant carrying a life-size cardboard cutout of Otto Kratt. "We love Otto Kratt! He is the most wonderful and glorious leader of Marche Noire who cares deeply for us when he chooses. He has every right to talk to his kinsmen wherever they are! You keep saying that people here have freedom of speech, yet you would deprive our ruler of his freedom to speak to us now? Leader, you must allow Mr. Kratt to campaign and organize rallies here."

3. "Maybe, this can be a win-win for everyone," ponders Solomon @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, your Minister of Twofold Solutions, while running his fingers through his hair. "Obviously, this dictator only wants to campaign here for his expats' votes, but he wouldn't come if they didn't exist... Just abolish dual citizenship. Our Marche Noirian immigrants can either decide to become fully-fledged @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ or be deported back to Marche Noire. This way, we'll keep the ones truly devoted to our way of life and Otto Kratt will get the votes he so desperately wants. Two birds, one stone!"

The Issue
Several of your aides were fired yesterday after the IT Department found pornography on their work computers. The former employees have fought back saying their privacy was violated and they should be restored to their positions.

The Debate
1. "Thank you so much for meeting with us, @@LEADER@@!" greets @@RANDOM_NAMEE@@, one of the aides fired for looking at pornography, while holding out @@HIS@@ hand for a handshake. "Please give us our jobs back! Just because I'm lonelier than most shouldn't be a reason to fire me. Look at my past performance reviews, I was a great worker who always got everything done ahead of schedule. Even if the computers are technically theirs, letting employers look into an employee's browsing history is a creepy invasion of privacy anyway, the practice should be outlawed regardless."

2. Your IT technician peers over a computer monitor while performing routine maintenance on your computer: "Are these people nuts? If people want to watch pornography they should do so in the privacy of their own homes, not on employers' computers. These employees violated your trust and therefore deserve to be punished. Your right to privacy ends when you start using your employers' computers."

3. "Let me touch bases with you for some outside of the box thinking," implores workplace coach @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I think giving your workers less detrimental ways to deal with workplace stress could be a real game changer. We need to enable employees to work smarter, not harder. Some low hanging fruit to help resolve this problem could include letting workers set their own hours, adding bean-bag chairs to the office, heck, maybe even mandating slides be put in the break-room. You could even force these things to be implemented across @@NAME@@, as I think they'll work together in synergy to create a real win-win."

While @@NAME@@'s northern ports bustle with trade during the summer time, this flurry of activity freezes to a standstill at the onset of winter when thick sheets of ice form over the frigid waters. This seasonal impasse both severely limits economic productivity and makes resupply of the region difficult.

The Debate
*1. "@@LEADER@@, we have a brilliant opportunity!" excitedly cheers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the mayor of one of the cities. "Imagine, our city, a front to the world in both summer and winter. All we need to do is develop and deploy a whole fleet of state-of-the-art icebreakers the likes of which the world has never seen before!

The Issue
With its colorful packaging and pleasantly sweet aroma, [i]Health-Squirt Vitamin Juice[/i] has rapidly become one of the most popular drink products in @@NAME@@.  Helping its sales are prime-time TV adverts claiming that it is [i]"a superfood that puts immune-system-boosting natural detox elements and energy-enhancing anti-oxidant vitamins into your cardiovascular system"[/i].  It was recently discovered that the product has no such qualities, and the adverts are clearly lying.

The Debate
1. "False Advertising, Nuisance To Public!" proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, lead journalist for [i]Health Magazine[/i], clearly planning @@HIS/HER@@ next newspaper headline. "But will it ever go away?  In this journo's humble opinion, yes!  Maybe the government should review advertisements to make sure we get THE TRUTH!"

"It's not like we're doing any harm, and promoting the idea of health has got to be of some benefit to those zombified couch potatoes who sit and play [i]@@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ vs Skeletons[/i] all day.

The Issue
Notorious gangster-rapper Wally E was recently taken to court for the suspected murder of a policeman, but was found innocent due to lack of evidence. This surprised many, as one of his more popular raps ([i]"I Killed A Cop And I Liked It"[/i]) contained a complete confession for the shooting within its lyrics.

The Debate
1. "How could we let this happen? I tell you, rap music is just sick minds preaching to a sick audience," spits right-wing demagogue @@RANDOM_NAME@@, free-styling on stage with a microphone in front of a cheering crowd. "There has to be something wrong with you to enjoy its message of anarchistic hate. We're talking about a recorded confession, flaunted in public. Rappers should be held to account for their hateful words, and their filth music should be admissible as court evidence." With that, she drops the mic, and strides off to rapturous applause.

2. "Woah woah woah, I mean... just cos I got, you know, artistic words shouldn't mean you haters should hate me," argues Wally E, reading from a prepared statement. "I mean, like, don't hate freedom of artistic expression, or something? I don't mean everything in my songs literally. We should be free, to like, artistically express. We are artists. Expressing ourselves. So don't hate on me. Yeah."

3. "The problem here is that rap music is terrible trash, enjoyed only by the musical illiterati," observes classical guitarist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, strumming out a complex flamenco ligado. "Shouldn't we pursue a bare minimum of artistic standards in our cultural output? Perhaps the government should create an official Music Standards Bureau to regulate what sort of material gets airplay and exposure. Frankly, we need a better class of music."

The Issue
A few days ago, just before local elections were due to run, a ruffian named Muhammad Lee was imprisoned for grand theft auto. As per policy, this excluded him from the right to vote. However, due to an administrative error, others of the same name - a whole legion of Muhammad Lees across the nation - also found themselves blocked at the polling stations.

The Debate
1. "I have committed no crime save sharing the prisoner's name, but I have been denied my basic democratic rights!" cries Muhammad Lee, a well-respected @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ lobbyist. "We must implement a Voter-ID system based on foolproof measures: passport photos, social security numbers, fingerprints AND iris-identification. Identity confusion cannot be allowed to happen again!"

2. "Don't see what society has got against prisoners anyway," contributes convicted child strangler, hate-crime inciter, and vote fraudster, Muhammad Lee. "How about giving prisoners the right to vote? When it comes down to it, we're all decent human beings, and we deserve to have a say in how society is run."

3. "This whole voting thing really is a pain," says your heavily tattooed cousin, Muhammad Lee. "Just seize power and become dictator of @@NAME@@. You know they will just keep electing you over and over and over again, so why not just formalize it with this final move. Bonus points for the fact that there will be no more issues about names and voting rights."

4. "No need to be that drastic," notes @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@-@@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@-@@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, one of your aides," but it must be noted that 'Muhammad Lee' is a very popular name among certain minorities that don't vote for you.

The Issue
Judging from the telegram on your desk this morning, the government of Tasmania is not pleased with your decision to authorize warplanes to patrol the migration of songbirds over its airspace. 

The Debate
1. The telegram reads, "You expect us to believe this is about birds? We reject your ridiculous pretense for violating our airspace. We know you are merely scouting the location of Tasmania's military bases in preparation for all-out war. Remove your forces from Tasmanian airspace today and pay us reparations for this insult, or the troops of Tasmania will be on your shores tomorrow. And you can bet our troops will have @@DEMONYM@@ Breegul in their sack lunch." 

2. "Those Tasmanians think they can boss us around?" crows your Minister of Defense, who is practically drooling over himself with pleasure. "As it so happens, while protecting those precious pigeons... or hummingbirds... oh whatever we said they were... we also incidentally mapped out the location of all the Tasmania military bases. As it also so happens, the patrol aircraft are fully armed with bunker-busting bombs. Just say the word, and we'll begin a strategic air strike and neuter the Tasmanian threat in minutes."

3. "If we must go to war, let's go to war!" cackles The Bird Lady, wearing a giant hawk suit complete with pointed talons. "But not that way. I've trained my flock of birds of prey in the art of war. Say the word, and I'll unleash my deadly and precise raptors on the soldiers of Tasmania. Death from above!"

The Issue
A small town judge has garnered national attention after sentencing a serial litterer to sit, in lieu of jail time, in a garbage can and hand out apology flyers to locals. Legal experts and concerned citizens have come to offer their unsolicited take on whether or not @@NAME@@ should embrace unorthodox punishments for petty criminals.

The Debate
1. "The government needs to stop telling me how to do my job," states the judge while banging his gavel against your desk. "Sending someone off to the big house merely trains them to be a better criminal! I merely seek to embarrass them or make them do a bit of community service. Like that kid who was spray painting trains; I had him do a mural for the Eastern @@NAME@@ Art Museum, and now he's blossomed into quite the artist. You should encourage us to use our judgement to find fitting, albeit unconventional, punishments for our criminals."

2. "I agree that punishments should be determined on a case-by-case basis, but this is hardly even a slap on the wrist!" grumbles Lexi Talia Onassis, an officer who is currently suspended for using excessive force. "If you want to see crime stop dead in its tracks, you need to enable the police to do to criminals what they have done to others without the hassle of the court system. If someone burns down a house, we burn down theirs! If someone commits murder, we murder them! If someone takes drugs, we... uh..." She trails off. "Anyway, we'll need some more funding for our officers. Things might get messy out there."

3. "Do you think it's wise to put the rehabilitation of our nation's minor offenders in the hands of a judge, or an officer for that matter?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a well-respected advisor in the Justice Department, as @@HE/SHE@@ opens a dozen manilla folders, spilling their contents across your desk. "If we were to open educational rehabilitation clinics in our cities, operated by my Department and overseen by psychological experts, we could design a comprehensive system to stamp out repeat offenses. All it takes is a little funding, but just imagine the informational seminars, four-hour documentaries, even guest speakers from the Retirement Community of Former Felons!"

4. "Do the crime, pay the time," replies a more orthodox judge with a shrug, trudging in after a sixteen-hour hearing. "Everybody wants a creative solution to our crime problem, but all you're doing is putting a burden on our legal professionals. Our primary responsibility is to determine guilt or innocence, and consistent rules for sentencing should be in place for reasons of fairness to the convicted. I suggest we have a fixed-term jail sentence for each crime, regardless of the circumstance. We'll save ourselves a lot of time, and it will eliminate any bias in the severity of punishments."

When separated dad @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ put his daughter @@RANDOMFEMALFIRSTNAME@@ on the train, he made sure her mum knew the correct time and platform at which the child was due to arrive. He also arranged for a babysitter to travel with the tot, given that she was only two years old. Controversially, the babysitter was his son, himself only seven years of age. A train conductor noted both children travelling alone, and intervened by calling the police and social services.

The Debate
1. "The only ****ing problem here is the ****ing train conductor ****ing interfering where he wasn't ****ing wanted," complains @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the mother of the two children, as she thrusts a sippy-cup containing Eckie-Cola at her resisting daughter. "We've been doing it this way for two ****ing years, and never had any ****ing problems. How about the government, the police, social services and all you other nosy ****s keep out of how we choose to deal with OUR ****ing children?"

2. "This is about child safety!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the train conductor. "I mean, we actually have a reasonably priced service where we offer supervision to unattended children. What sort of lousy parent puts a seven-year-old in charge of a two-year-old? Frankly, if parents are too lazy to use the provisions, they shouldn't be allowed to raise kids at all. You should invest in Child Protection Services, and extend their powers to take children into safe, governmental care when they're being neglected by incompetent parents."

3. "If I might interject?" interrupts @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, the seven-year-old boy at the centre of the saga, as he changes his sister's nappy. "Clearly capability varies from child to child, but some of us are obviously more advanced than others. While I accept [i]a priori[/i] that adults are responsible for safeguarding the wellbeing of children, I think there's room for flexibility in the interpretation of adulthood. Posit: Can we institute a formal test, to be applied for at any age, that is legally required to prove capacity to act [i]in loco parentis[/i]? I've been reading up on the legal ins-and-outs, and it seems like a straightforward enough possibility. I'd be happy to help you draft something."

The Debate
1. "There's people trapped in the rubble!" shouts your driver, young Walter Lee, grabbing a crowbar, a shovel and a small red brick from the trunk of the car. "Emergency services are trying to get through, but traffic is gridlocked! Come on, boss, let's head there on foot! We can get digging, and maybe save a life or two!"

"The nation is in panic here, and your duty is to soothe their nerves and appeal for calm. Let's get a press conference set up, and then a Crisis Co-ordination Centre. We can be much more effective if we remember that you're the nation's leader, not an emergency worker."

It seems unlikely that they acted alone, so now you need to root out the mastermind behind this violent attack...

The Debate
*1. "The curfew has made both police investigation and maintaining order much easier," gratefully reports Chief of Police @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "but if we want to break open the support network of these terrorists, we'll need your permission to take a more robust approach. I'm talking about detention for interrogation of their family members and known associates, a low threshold of probable cause for initiation of investigation and freedom to act in the name of national security without being tied up with paperwork. Lose the red tape, and I'll get you truth." [[color=red]Must have curfew[/color]]

*2. "If we want to break open the support network of these terrorists, we'll need your permission to take a more robust approach," reports Chief of Police @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I'm talking about detention for interrogation of their family members and known associates, a low threshold of probable cause for initiation of investigation, and freedom to act in the name of national security without being tied up with paperwork. Lose the red tape, and I'll get you truth." [[color=blue]Must not have curfew[/color]]

[3]. "Data and data-processing are what we need here," claims social media guru Archie Meades. "I suggest crowd-sourcing your anti-terrorism efforts. Share what intel you have in the public domain: personal data of the suicide bombers, any video footage and basically anything else you can get hold of relating to that day. Then, let a motivated populace trawl through it and use their own ideas and creativity to collectively find the truth. Give me a lever long enough, a place to stand and one million unpaid volunteers, and we can move the world!" [[color=blue]Must have Internet[/color], [color=blue]Must have computers[/color]]

[4]. "If you want to find your culprits fast, I think I might have new software to help you..." suggests criminologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Link up the capital's CCTV feeds to my image machine-learning program and with a combination of phrenological face-mapping, gait-profiling and chromodermal analysis will tell you exactly who to arrest, and when." [[color=red]Must have Internet[/color], [color=blue]Must have computers[/color]]

5. "If we want answers, we need to get past the wall of silence," pleads social worker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Young men in the Violetist community get radicalised because they feel isolated, and frankly they just don't trust the police. Our cops need cultural sensitivity training. For example, did you know that Violetists are taught not to trust anyone not wearing purple somewhere on their clothing? We should be adding a nice indigo hatband to our police caps! Get them to trust us, and maybe they'll rat out their extremist buddies."

6. "If you want results, you ought to hire experienced professionals," offers Commander @@RANDOM_NAME@@, of Private Military Contractor [i]Shades Of Grey[/i]. "My group are experienced at urban operations, and we have a high success rate in location and resolution of insurgent and terrorist threats. We just need funds, and for you to look the other way while we do what needs to be done to get your answers." @@HE@@ places cable ties, sack hood and jump leads on your desk, and raises @@HIS@@ eyebrows suggestively.

7. "Hate to say it, but what you need here is good old-fashioned coppering, boots-on-the-ground police work, and maybe properly-paid overtime," offers Detective Sergeant @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It's all about asking friendly questions, getting people to open up, and doing the legwork with no shortcuts. Not quite like [i]CSI: @@CAPITAL@@[/i] on the telly, but it's what works."

The Story So Far
In response to a terrorist attack, you have granted extraordinary powers to those responsible for rooting out terror threats within @@NAME@@.

The Issue
A Violetist priest who criticised the national curfew and the government's response to recent events was arrested. He was then 'heavily questioned' for twelve hours, with a bucket of soapy frogs and a rubber wetsuit with the bottom cut out of it. Now free, the fellow is making noises about human rights and inherent dignity, while complaining about the 'advanced questioning tactics' being used.

The Debate
1. "It's not just that I was unfairly arrested," complains the limping clergyman, @@RANDOM_NAMEMALE@@, "but also that the whole approach being taken is not going to be effective. There's reams of evidence that torture does not work as an interrogation technique, and that the most effective form of questioning is a friendly and open manner, to encourage a cooperative attitude. You must ban the use of physical and mental abuse as a state tool of interrogation."

2. "Torture? Do not be a silly one, this is not the torture!" argues Interrogation Enhancement Specialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in oddly patterned speech, wiping @@HIS@@ knuckles clean with a silk handkerchief. "You can be thinking on it as an extension of the good cop, the bad cop. We use the gentle persuasion when we need to, and we use the not-so-gentle persuasion when we need to. A bit of the waterboarding, or the sleep deprivation, or the pain positions: none of these are the torture, per se. Do not be tying our hands in the red tape, or you will be compromising the nation's national security. You are caring about the nation's national security, are you not?"

3. "It's not so much whether it works as a tool of information gathering," adds Psychological Operations Chief Dr. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, "but also the broader effects it has on our overall approach. Engaging in punitive and permanent non-voluntary bodily modification and induced physical extremity magnitude reduction may not make an individual more talkative, especially in the surgically-induced absence of glossal musculature, ha ha... But the truth is we aren't trying to reach the individual. Rather, think of the extensive group psychological impact, the deterrence effect, and the fear we can instill on our nation's enemies! That is why we must do all we can to maximise our interrogation impact index."

The Story So Far
@@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange has been bombed by Violetist terrorists, but with no visible enemy to strike back against, frustrations are rising.

The Issue
Spoiling for revenge and impatient with the lack of results from police investigations, militant far-right groups have decided to take matters into their own hands. There have been reports across @@NAME@@ of Violetist citizens coming under attack from mobs keen to dispense midnight vigilante justice on anyone who shares the faith or culture of the terrorists.

The Debate
1. "We need to make it clear that we're not a nation that persecutes folk for their choice of religion," simpers flower-in-hair peacenik @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You need a public education campaign to encourage tolerance and diversity, and maybe you could personally visit a Violetist temple or two to show that we're all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ together."

2. "Sure, sure, peace and understanding and all that hoo-haa are lovely," mutters Army Sergeant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "but we need a more direct solution to save lives in the here-and-now. Station armed troops in a ring of steel around Violetist neighbourhoods, and nobody will get in or out without our permission. We can also shoot down any fools who are there to cause trouble and simultaneously remind the local Violetists that we're keeping an eye on them, in every possible way."

3. "Seems like that would be punishing the victims of violence," worries Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Can't we just catch and arrest the vigilantes, and maybe put in stricter laws against hate speech and bigotry? Aim at those inciting violence, and the attacks will stop."

4. "We are merely being responsible citizens, assisting our government in cleansing the nation of Violetist influences," states self-appointed and black-uniformed Colonel @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ of the [i]@@DEMONYM@@ First Militia[/i]. "You should be endorsing our organisation, and applauding our efforts! No Violetists will escape alive!"

The Story So Far
@@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange has been bombed by Violetist extremist terrorists, but you've not let this get in the way of a policy of religious tolerance and peaceful co-existence with Violetist communities.

The Issue
Visiting a Violetist temple on the west side of @@CAPITAL@@ you're surprised to see your teenage nephew, Montague, at the temple and wearing the traditional purple skullcap of Violetism. What's more, he looks to be holding hands with an immigrant girl his own age, whom you realise is from the local Violetist neighbourhood.

The Debate
1. "Oh, hey..." greets Montague, looking a little worried. "Uh... this is Julie, and we've been kind of hanging out and we're kind of together now. Also, I'm... umm... converting to Violetism. Can we maybe just keep this on the down-low? I don't want her or me in the centre of a media circus."

2. "@@LEADER@@, it's an honour to meet you," says the Violetist girl, lowering her eyes deferentially for a moment, before deciding to meet your gaze. "If I may: I am not ashamed of my love for Monty, rather I am proud of it. If you want, we can be the figureheads for community integration for your campaign, so that all can see you as a leader who is close to minority communities."

3. "Oh... wow... uh, really... NO!" interrupts Civil Policy Officer Crupkey. "I mean, I got nothing against this in principle: my dad was an immigrant and my mum a local. But right now? When there's so much anti-Violetist sentiment? When we haven't even had the funerals of some of the bomb victims yet? These kids need to cool their hormones, and maybe start dating again in a year or so, when everything is calmer."

The Story So Far
Since @@NAME@@ suffered a terrorist attack in the heart of @@CAPITAL@@, you have been looking to unpick the support network behind the suicide bombers, and to identify the brains behind the operation...

The Issue
Success! Your chosen methods appear to have paid dividends, and your Intelligence Services have identified the terrorist ringleader behind the @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange bombings. What's more, you know exactly where his fortified HQ compound is. The only problem? It's deep within the nation of Blackacre, who historically haven't been too keen on @@DEMONYM@@ military actions within their sovereign territory.

The Debate
1. "This is a tricky situation," surmises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your ambassador to Blackacre. "I think we can make a deal, though. We can ask Blackacre to use their armed forces to engage and deal with this terrorist, and in return support a narrative that gives them credit for locating him. Also, maybe we could sweeten the pot by discreetly releasing those two Blackacre spies that we caught snooping around last year. Everyone wins!"

2. "We can't rely on Blackacre. After all, who is to say they're not in league with the terrorists?" questions Intelligence Director @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "Let's move in below the radar, and have plausibly deniable intelligence operatives carry out an assassination of the terrorist leader. We can claim we have nothing to do with his death, while simultaneously being sure that the threat has been neutralised."

3. "This terrorist has declared war on @@NAME@@, and he can't escape justice by sheltering within a foreign power!" asserts General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, waving @@HIS@@ hands in the air, indicating that @@HE@@ does in fact care. "I'm going to need a rapid insertion force of paratroopers for a surgical strike on the camp, with a fighter escort to keep Blackacre from interfering. For The @@TYPE@@!"

4. "Sounds to me like every approach has downsides," worries your elderly mother. "Maybe you could just announce his location to the world, and hope that somebody else deals with him."

The Story So Far
When the @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange was destroyed by terrorist attack, it was a blow to the heart of @@NAME@@. The terrorists responsible were identified, as well as the mastermind behind the attack. Now, the crisis is over.

The Issue
Time moves on, and most @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ have begun to drift back into their normal routines. However, for the families of the victims of the attack, the void caused by the absence of their loved ones will be felt for the rest of their lives. The site where the terrorists struck is now being cleared of rubble, and debate has begun over the future of the area. 

The Debate
1. "We need a memorial to those who died, and perhaps a plaque to thank the rescue workers who did what they could in this darkest of hours," suggests the mayor of @@CAPITAL@@. "Also, a Tribute Centre and a Memorial Museum. Money from ticket sales could go to the families of the deceased. We must never forget these events."

*2. "No. We can't let them think they hurt us!" asserts stockbroker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who lost several colleagues to the bombing, showing @@HIS@@ depth of grief by conducting half a dozen online trades as @@HE@@ talks to you. "The best way of reacting to terror is business as usual. Have a new Stock Exchange built, bigger and better than before, with faster trading connections and more computing power.

*3.

Let's look to the future rather than the past." [[color=red]Must not have internet[/color]]

4. "The nation has suffered, but those of our faith have suffered more than the rest of you," states Violetist community leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If we want to move forward into a new era of inclusiveness and forgiveness, maybe the best way to achieve this is to establish a Violetist temple on the site. Allow us to show solidarity with the rest of @@NAME@@ by condemning the terrorists, and to atone for their actions through quiet prayer, community service and human sacri... uh... human kindness."

[5]. "Never forget!" yells right wing paramilitary @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Never forget that it was the toxic false faith of Violetism that led to this tragedy! I propose we use the site to establish the HQ for my anti-Violetist organisation, the [i]Brave Inquisitorial Guardians Of Truth[/i].

[b][anchor=747]#747[/anchor]: The Plane Truth [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
You've just returned from a pleasant "diplomatic summit" on the tropical island nation of East Calypso. As your plane approaches @@CAPITAL@@ Airport, bright sunlight glimmers upon the foreign names and insignia on a variety of parked aircraft. Eventually, you see a few shabby tail fins with the Air @@NAME@@ logo. The woeful assortment of filthy fuselages and peeling paint barely looks airworthy. Is the national airline truly that pathetic?

The Debate
*1. While waiting for the airplane to reach the gate, you receive a call from Bryan Ringham, a management consultant and frequent flier. He doesn't waste time with chitchat. "Did you know that overhead at Air @@NAME@@ has seen a 380% increase over the last ten years? They won't be competitive with numbers like that. You could help them by eliminating all regulations that prevent airlines from charging for extra services such as seat reservations, checked bags, and clean drinking water. We can have a nice, lucrative budget airline here - and maybe even create some revenue for the shareholders!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. While waiting for the airplane to reach the gate, you receive a call from Bryan Ringham, a management consultant and frequent flier. He doesn't waste time with chitchat. "Did you know that overhead at Air @@NAME@@ has seen a 380% increase over the last ten years? You won't be competitive with numbers like that.

We can have a nice, lucrative budget airline here - and maybe even create some revenue for the national coffers!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

3. As you disembark and enter the airport, you run into a group of flight attendants who are wearing the national airline's uniform and carrying protest signs. Their leader approaches you. "Your Excellency! Our working conditions are appalling. Air @@NAME@@ will never be able to improve if we're all working sixty hours a week for the industry's worst wages. Anyone who can get a better job with one of the foreign competitors like Maxay Pacific or Althaniq Airways has already left. Decreased hours and improved pay would do wonders for morale - meaning that we could serve the passengers better, of course."

4. Following this confrontation, your security detail ushers you through an employee break area to bypass the crowds. However, you are soon ambushed by airline manager @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Aileron, who appears to have packed @@HIS/HER@@ lunch in an airsickness bag. "Why don't we just ban all the foreign airlines?" @@HE/SHE@@ declares, while still chewing @@HIS/HER@@ food. "All of these outsiders are taking our people's money and sending it to our enemies! A true patriot only flies Air @@NAME@@, no matter how lousy the service is or how many times we skip routine maintenance - er, I mean, skip the needless luxuries. Without any foreign competition, we could keep every last @@CURRENCY@@ within our borders."

**5. Later, FlyerChat forum moderator 'Queen of the Skies' sends you a private message. "Air @@NAME@@ has nothing but disregard for its loyal passengers. First of all, the frequent flyer miles are useless. My most recent valuation puts them at only one-thousandth of a @@CURRENCY@@. Award availability is terrible, even with zirconium status. And don't get me started on the atrocious brand of caviar they serve in first class! This needs to be an airline that cares about its passengers, even if that requires huge government subsidies to bring it up to par.

The Story So Far
When terrorists attacked the @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange, many courageous volunteers braved the dangers of the ruined building to help search for and recover survivors from the rubble.

The Issue
The danger is long passed, and the site cleared, but there now appear to be multiple cases of mesothelial lung cancer and other serious respiratory ailments amongst the volunteers who attended the site at the time of the attack. Doctors are attributing this to exposure to toxic smoke and building dust.

The Debate
1. "Hard to... talk..." wheezes breathless patient @@RANDOM_NAME@@, struggling to be heard through @@HIS@@ oxygen mask. "We helped out... for @@NAME@@. Now we want... @@NAME@@... to help us. Healthcare... financial... support. Please, @@LEADER@@... please."

2. "Yes, yes, a lot of people have health problems for lots of reasons, it's terribly tragic," yawns clinical oncologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving the patient away. "The answer here is not compassion in a case-by-case basis, but a broader approach of socialised medicine, so that anybody who needs healthcare can get it when they need it."

3. "That's communist claptrap! It's not for you to spend MY taxes on other people's health," says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, CEO of Panacea Private Medical Services. "Look, I will help these people out of my own pocket, for no reason other than that because I'm super-duper charitable and a really great guy! See? No government intervention needed, just free individuals in a free market helping each other out without the nanny state getting in the way. Three cheers for the free market!" He starts writing a cheque for 10 @@CURRENCY@@ for the cancer victim.

[4]. Walter Lee, your loyal driver, snarls at the CEO, hefting a small red brick at his head to scare him out of the room. "Um, boss... weren't you there at the centre of things, digging through the rubble? I reckon if you declare a six-month complete tax break for all people who were there at that time, that'd give people the cash to afford their own healthcare and show the nation's thanks for their goodness.

[b][anchor=749]#749[/anchor]: Not Mushroom For Error [Bears Armed; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
Wild mushroom season is upon @@NAME@@ again, and as is traditional, @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ from all over the country will go out to gather nature's bounty. In recent years, however, there have been more and more deaths due to people mistaking poisonous fungi for harmless ones.

The Debate
1. "Ignorance is the problem," comments Mario Morchella, famed plumber and forest forager, passing you a peach he found near an old castle. "You should set up a system for training and licensing people who want to collect wild fungi, require collectors have the best field guide books, and ban any unlicensed individuals from mushroom gathering. Also, increase the number of park rangers, so these life-saving measures are properly enforced." 

2. "Quality is the problem," suggests @@randomfirstname@@ Cantharellus, one of @@NAME@@'s leading mycologists. "First, let's ban wild mushroom foraging. But also, we must increase funding for mushroom farming research. I know we can develop domesticated mushroom varieties and farming methods that would match wild ones for variation in type, good taste, and other desired properties. People can have their mushrooms and eat them without risking death too!" 

*3. "Greed is the problem," complains @@randomfirstname@@ Grifola, Under-Minister for Food Production. "They're the people's mushrooms. They should only be harvested by state agents, after which they can be checked by proper experts and then distributed fairly... with priority rationing for senior Party members, of course." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

*4. "Cityfolks is the problem," retorts Rural Association representative @@randomfirstname@@ Tuber, in his rustic dialect. "We countryfolk knows good 'shrooms from bad, all right. It's just townies coming out to take stuff without even a 'by your leave' that is getting theyselves into this here trouble. Let's keep 'em out of our fields and woods, where they doesn't belong no-hows, and then they won't end up deader 'n four o'clock. Oh, and we'll supply you with plenty of fine wild mushrooms for free iffen you wants 'em." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

5. "Mollycoddling is the problem," grumbles libertarian thinker @@randomfirstname@@ Amanita. "You should do away with this nanny-state system, and let people take whatever risks they think they can manage; and if they fail… well, then that's just Darwinism at work."

[b][anchor=750]#750[/anchor]: Cheerleading Community Does The Splits [Sanhon; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
When [i]East @@CAPITAL@@ High School[/i] denied a male student's request to join their cheerleading squad, they thought that was the end of it. Since then, the story has been picked up by the national media, with the boy, the cheerleading coach, and a spokesperson from [i]Equality @@NAME@@[/i] giving interviews about the controversy. Now, a gaggle of highly-opinionated and very-spirited individuals have entered your office, demanding your attention.

The Debate
1. "Give me an 'E'! Give me a 'Q'! Give me a 'U'-'A'-'L'! Give me an 'I', and a 'T', and a great big 'Y'! What's it spell? EQUALITY!" cries @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, doing an impressive backflip routine in his plaid skirt. "Every boy deserves an equal chance to live out their dreams, whether that dream is to cheer a mediocre football team, or be on a mediocre football team! You must force every school to allow any individual to join any team they want, regardless of sex! Why not? Girls are just as strong as boys, and we boys can be darn cute in these skirts!" Cheering your name, he cartwheels out the door.

2. "Cheerleading is for girls, and only for girls," asserts middle-aged former cheerleader and parent, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, as she attempts to perform a forward roll, but gets stuck underneath your desk. "Let the boys do wholesome boy sports, like football and boxing, away from our precious daughters! You know what teen boys are like: primitive hormone factories, only after one thing! Besides, with rates of sexual abuse on campuses already so high, you must prevent boys and girls having any contact in sport." She ceases her attempts to extricate herself from beneath the desk, gasping for air.

3. "You're both idiots!" thunders @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, his neck muscles straining against the collar of his camouflage shirt. "Cheerleading is stupid. It's not even a real sport! The funds wasted on girls prancing about could be used on REAL sports, that help REAL men to become strong and powerful! Taught by manly coaches, like me. Abolish this waste of money immediately, and pour the cash into useful, manly sports!" He punts one of your priceless vases into your equally priceless chandelier.

A legal battle is raging between the [i]@@NAME@@ Department of Life, The Universe, and Environment[/i] and [i]Kay Rumble Property Development Group[/i]. While surveying for a luxury condominium complex, a rare @@ANIMAL@@ subspecies, the two-spotted glow-in-the-dark @@ANIMAL@@, was found traipsing around the proposed build site, potentially holding up construction.

The Debate
1. "I'm all for protecting truly endangered animals," grumbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of the housing firm, "but you can't walk ten feet in @@NAME@@ without tripping over @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@. So what if these particular ones have a different spot on their underbellies or whatever? I'm trying to build houses for people - your people - and I keep running into red tape because of these damn hippies! We need to loosen these protection laws so I can get on with my job."

2. "But the three-striped, er... or was it four-toed @@ANIMAL@@, is truly unique!" squeals @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted environmentalist, while nursing a baby @@ANIMAL@@. "This subspecies is rare enough without these greedy opportunists destroying the only habitat they have left. These poor darlings need our protection. If an endangered species, subspecies, or genetically diverse population has been spotted, no form of molestation or habitat destruction should be allowed."

3. "With all due respect, you're huffing and puffing over a truly simple matter," chastens @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an amateur carpenter, while patting your shoulder gently. "We don't need to drive these creatures nor land-development to extinction. If we require developers create new habitat to replace whatever endangered populations they destroy, then everybody wins, don't they? I'm sure the two-spotted glow-in-the-dark @@ANIMAL@@ will adapt just fine to their new, man-made habitats."

[b][anchor=752]#752[/anchor]: The Immortal Cells of Mrs. Gratwick [The Atlae Isles; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Two generations ago, scientists took a biopsy of a tumor from a cancer patient named Elizabeth Gratwick, who died soon after. Without her knowledge or consent, these cells were preserved in the laboratory and proved to be exceptionally stable in replication. As stable cancer cell lines are highly useful for medical research, "ElGr cells" have been sent to and used by scientists all over the world. However, objections are now being raised by Elizabeth's descendants.

The Debate
1. "We thought my poor grandmother's remains had been buried in accordance with her wishes," growls Elizabeth's direct descendant, Catherine Gratwick. "Can't you let her rest in peace? This is [i]her[/i] body that you're messing with. You can't just irradiate and poison her; you must ask me first! How would you like it if your family's remains were exhumed and mutilated? You must never use cells from deceased people without the explicit pre-mortem consent of the patient or their relatives. As for granny - I insist that all remaining samples of her be buried, and that you financially compensate her family for the pain and grief you have caused!"

2. "No! ElGr cells are a scientific miracle!" cries biologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, jiggling a beaker full of purplish goop as @@HE@@ waves @@HIS@@ arms in exasperation. "These cells have been a breakthrough; not only in testing cures for cancer, but also in understanding how cancer develops and functions! All these years later, these cells keep chugging along, outliving all the others! Who knows, with these cells, we might even one day unlock a path to immortality! Are you going to let bureaucracy get in the way of SCIENCE?"

3. "This stuff is funny!" giggles your niece, squishing her fingers in the goop. "It's all warm, gluey, and bouncy! Someone should be turning out this stuff for kids to play with, or as sticky putty to stick posters to walls, or whatever. You've got, like, an infinite supply of it, so that's good economics, right?"

"We can make plasma flamethrowers, plasma machine guns, plasma ship cannon, plasma howitzers, plasma knives, basically plasma anything! With sheer firepower, we'd be able to overpower anything and anybody! We're... just a bit low on funding... so can you buy us the gear we need?"

2. "But this is going to be the hottest new thing," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of HydrogenScience Corp. "You have to let the private sector in on the profits! Just share with us any early data and blueprints you have, and we'll give your nation special discount rates when we sell plasma weaponry to the world. Oh, we'll also need permission to sell plasma pistols and rifles to your citizenry as well! The only way to stop a bad guy with a plasma rifle is a good guy with a plasma rifle: access to white-hot killing power is the fundamental right of every man, woman and child!" [[color=blue]Must have private industries[/color]]

3. "This stuff is far too unstable to be deployed as a weapon of war!" yelps pacifist physician and aid worker Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "For the good of the nation and international peace, you should be concentrating solely on the healthcare and industry applications of plasma and laser devices." @@HE/SHE@@ then proceeds to spray-paint a peace sign on your desk.

4. "I think we can compromise," offers grey-suited logistician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, looking worriedly over the latest prices of neodymium and high-output capacitors. "How about we simply stop this plasma weaponry research, and instead divert the money to buying tried-and-tested conventional weaponry?"

The Issue
Two decommissioned satellites recently collided, the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ craft [i]@@ANIMAL@@-4[/i], and East Lebatuck's [i]Sputnak-3[/i]. In the aftermath, scientists have become alarmed over the possibility of [i]Kessler syndrome[/i], a phenomenon where the density of debris in space becomes so high collisions can have a domino effect, causing further collisions and debris. Using crayons and peanut butter, your aides have drawn you a diagram to try to convince you that this positive feedback loop could ultimately destroy all low earth orbit satellites, making space travel impossible for generations.

The Debate
1. "I have a bad feeling about this," warns famously handsome astronaut, Lieutenant George Kloonalski. "It's the same feeling I once had on a space walk while repairing a satellite, and that did not end up going well. But I don't want to bore you with my space stories, the point is, reforms are desperately needed to make sure collisional cascading does not happen. You should make sure every satellite launched in @@NAME@@ has high standards of safety and planning, most importantly having a plan for satellite disposal at mission's end. Given the gravity of the situation, I think these steps are unavoidable."

2. "Taking unilateral action is futile if other space-faring nations do not also act in kind," remarks mediator Carey Fissinger, well known for space shuttle diplomacy. "We need to immediately launch an international space debris summit to assure that all nations, not just @@NAME@@, properly regulate launched satellites. Given the dependence of modern economies on satellites, we shouldn't be afraid to use trade sanctions and other forms of political pressure to persuade all nations to agree to global regulations."

3. "But East Lebatuck started it!" whines @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your more petulant advisers. "[i]@@ANIMAL@@-4[/i] was just fine until that stupid [i]Sputnak-3[/i] hit it. We shouldn't have to do anything other than tell the world where we're putting satellites. It's up to East Lebatuck to move out of our way!"

The Issue
Outdoor survival expert @@ANIMAL@@ Grylls was being filmed in the latest edition of [i]Man Vs Wilderness: Untamed[/i], when he stumbled upon a top-secret military base that even you didn't know about. Not only did he discover the clandestine base, but he also broke into it - alongside his entire media crew - thanks to his shrewd usage of camouflage and bottles of urine. TV-broadcasted footage inadvertently shows highly-sensitive and confidential projects in the background of many scenes. With this in mind, you have decided to venture into a dark, smelly room in an isolated wing of the government offices to call a covert meeting.

The Debate
*1. "There can be no mercy," argues the gruff voice of the commander of the @@NAME@@ military, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We must publicly execute Mr. Grylls and his crew. No exceptions. The government should send a message to the public! You must show them that the state will hound them relentlessly if they are caught snooping around. Double the guards, double their weapons, double everything!" [[color=blue]Must not have prisons[/color]]

*2. "There can be no mercy," argues the gruff voice of the commander of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ military, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We must imprison Mr. Grylls and his crew for the rest of their lives. No exceptions. The government should send a message to the public! You must show them that the state will hound them relentlessly if they are caught snooping around. Double the guards, double their weapons, double everything!" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

3. "I, uh, I'm not so sure about the whole 'no mercy' thing," stammers a handcuffed @@ANIMAL@@ Grylls, with a concerned look on his face. "I mean, it's your own fault that we found it, right? If someone stumbles upon government secrets, y'should just let them wander on. Can I, uh, go now? I've gotta film an episode on those venomous pigeons by tomorrow."

4. "The solution is obvious," claims military strategist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "All we have to do is come out with all of the information stored in that base - false, of course. Then, we come up with some good lies to convince the public that these secret systems are something else. Do you think we could pass these rockets off as a fireworks display?"

5. "It's all too much hassle," sighs your Intelligence Minister, resting @@HER@@ head upon the meeting table. "You know what, @@LEADER@@? We should just tell them everything. No more secrets, no more hidden military projects. Release all of the government's confidential information into the open, and let them do what they want with it. Maybe we could crowdsource some suggestions for our new underground projects?"

[b][anchor=756]#756[/anchor]: The Issue With Issues [Maori Moon; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
After an influx of poorly thought out, redundant, and otherwise trivial issues have been shoved across your desk, concern has been raised as to whether the government should start better regulating the issues you receive.

The Debate
1. "There must be an issue crack down!" bellows @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your personal secretary, while removing gum off @@HIS@@ shoe. "If we don't do something, pretty soon we'll be getting issues that could have just as easily been dealt with the flip of a coin!" @@HE@@ pauses to discreetly move an old picture of your niece and her pet from your direct line of sight. "Let your staff take care of the frivolity so you can focus on the big stuff. In fact, if a government official passes on an issue that's too trivial to you, fire them on the spot!"

2. You suddenly hear a shattering noise and find @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Advisor Of Trivial Matters, has broken through your office window. "Sorry about that, your office door was being fixed," @@HE@@ apologies. "Anyway, an issues crackdown? Ha! Your window's a trivial issue, yet you'll probably be enlisting all of @@NAME@@'s government to replace it! I say, anyone who wants should be able to bring an issue directly to your attention! Then the people will feel like the government is a helpful organization working for them, not something big to fear! If that doesn't work, I'll even help fix your window!"

3. "There's no need to go to either extreme," ponders @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an intern and amateur vuvuzela-player who was just practicing @@NAME@@'s national anthem outside your window. "I have a creative solution: we should create a rigorous, 34-tier color-coded system to evaluate how @@LEADER@@-worthy an issue is and you can work through the issue queue accordingly. The people with most urgent and important issue will get a faster response. Everybody wins!"

4. "It's not the issues that you've got to watch out for, but the sorts of people that are giving you solutions," volunteers the bee suit clad Dr. Bees, walking hand-and-hand into your office with the Bird Lady. "I can't help but notice that some of the people who are giving you advice are a bit... odd. You just need to make sure that you're properly vetting all your advisors, then the actual decisions making process will be a snap, no matter how trivial or important an issue is."

[b][anchor=757]#757[/anchor]: Extra Credit? [Kingdom of Jacobia; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
A series of cases of mistaken identity from the credit bureau Expertfaux recently culminated in your young cousin receiving a deluge of petitions from aggrieved citizens. Frustrated @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@, who are beginning to doubt their own names, have called the efficacy and necessity of modern credit bureaus into question.

The Debate
1. "These people have no credibility!" protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, littering your desk with the shredded ruins of @@HIS/HER@@ credit report. "Incompetent credit bureaus' background checks labeled Mr. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ as a criminal and Ms. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ as deceased. Besides, any attempt to boil down my life into a single number will fall short of doing me justice. Credit bureaus need more oversight, so they can't come between hardworking @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ and the loans we need!"

2. "These were minor mishaps," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a representative from Expertfaux, who appears to be addressing a government accountant instead of you. "Lenders, landlords, and even employers need our services to weed out undeserving clients. Imagine if companies didn't know who in the blue they were lending to! Credit bureaus must be allowed to self-regulate without government interference. The future of our wallets depends on it!"

3. "Doing background checks one at a time is so inefficient," muses the accountant in question, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why not put credit regulation under government control, and research people's financial history in advance? That way anybody can access our database at any time. I'm sure the police would love to have a record of major transactions and movements too."

[b][anchor=758]#758[/anchor]: Bye Bye to the Birdies? [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
After Smalltopian journalists reporting on recent protein powder trade negotiations penned more articles on @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ government buildings covered in bird droppings than international commerce, questions have been raised as to whether @@NAME@@'s "pigeon problem" has gotten out of control.

The Debate
1. "Get these damned flying rats off me!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@ Hitchcock, a member of the @@CAPITAL@@ Beautification Council, desperately trying to wave away the pigeons pecking at @@HIM@@. "These vermin are everywhere, defecating on us, spreading disease and damaging bronze and marble with their caustic droppings. It's all happening because a bunch of nutjobs are feeding them to feel good about themselves. @@LEADER@@, ban pigeon-feeding immediately, so we may be free of this feathered pestilence!"

2. "This is their city as much as it is ours,'' sings your childhood nanny Miriam Poppout, while staring at a snow globe with unsettling intensity. "You can't let these beautiful creatures die! We should embrace bird feeding. @@CAPITAL@@ will become known as 'The City of a Million Pigeons' and tourists will flock from across the world to see the birds and feed them at only two @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ a bag."

3. "I can't see what the fuss is about," chimes in B.F. Spinner, a spokesperson of the @@CAPITAL@@ Ornithological Society. "Ask any illusionist or postman you know: pigeons are highly trainable animals. If the problem is that they are pooping around, they can simply be given potty training. Just put small toilet bowls at designated spots in the city, equipped with a food dispenser that gives food pellets when a pigeon poops there. The pooping behavior will thus be positively reinforced and voila! - the next time the pigeon will go to the toilet bowl when it needs to poop. Problem solved!"

[b][anchor=759]#759[/anchor]: Marry, Marry, Quite Contrarily [Neocaledonia; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
The congregation of a local church of @@RELIGION@@ has come under fire after their refusal to wed a homosexual couple, inciting protesters to glitter bomb the pastor and congregants.

The Debate
1. "We should be allowed to marry whenever and wherever we want," insists gay rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If these people's 'God' is such a bigot, then maybe they should find a new one. Churches should either agree to conduct gay marriages or not be allowed to conduct marriages at all. You can't have one rule for straight folk and another rule for gay people."

2. "This is absurd!" exclaims Pastor Hal E. Looya, still picking glitter out of his hair. "You know what that very same woman said before gay marriage was legal? 'However much others may despise our positions on certain issues, we still have every right to live the life we want.' Now she's trying to force her beliefs on us! If the gays are that desperate to feel like they are 'married', they can find a church that shares their views or they can go to a public courthouse. Just leave us out of it."

3. "This is the logical result of government sticking its nose where it has no business," insists your libertarian cousin @@RANDOM_NAME@@, giving you the same line he does anytime you ask for his opinion. "@@NAME@@ shouldn't officially recognize or even provide tax breaks for any marriage, homosexual or heterosexual. Nor should it care if religions want to discriminate against various people for whatever reason. All marriages and religions should be treated equally, in the sense that they aren't being treated by the government at all."

[b][anchor=760]#760[/anchor]: A Debatable Question [Maxemia; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
It's election season in @@NAME@@, and several of the smaller political parties are voicing their concerns about being left out of the big televised debates, again.

The Debate
1. "It's so unfair," sulks Lord Kettlenoggin, leader of the [i]Marxist Alliance For The Advancement Of Agrarian Libertarianism [/i](MAFTAOAL), while speaking to a local gathering of six people. "We polled just below one percent last election cycle, and I demand to be heard! In fact, anybody that wants to join in should have the right to do so. The big parties are just scared to let us debate with them, but don't let that get in the way of what really matters; vox populism, eh, populi."

*2. "It's both fair and efficient," lectures @@RANDOM_NAME@@, majority whip for the [i]Liberal Conservatives[/i], while putting out a cigar on a [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Supremacy Party[/i] campaign pamphlet. "Only the biggest parties stand a real chance at power, and muddling what really matters with thirty different fringe causes – that have no ground in reality – would be unfair to the voters. Trying to mess with the way we've been doing political debates since the dawn of time will only serve to put mental stress on the masses, so let's not." [[color=blue]Smoking is legal[/color]]

*3. "It's both fair and efficient," lectures @@RANDOM_NAME@@, majority whip for the Liberal Conservatives, while crushing a [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Supremacy Party[/i] campaign pamphlet under @@HIS/HER@@ heel. "Only the biggest parties stand a real chance at power, and muddling what really matters with thirty different fringe causes, which have no ground in reality, would be unfair to the voters. Trying to mess with the way we've been doing political debates since the dawn of time will only serve to put mental stress on the masses, so let's not." [[color=red]Smoking is illegal[/color]]

4. "I don't think we have to go to either extreme here," suggests Simon Cobweb, former TV-producer and the freshest face on your team of spin-doctors. "If we gave the power to decide eligibility to some non-partisan commission, they could set specific criteria to be included in the televised debates, and a panel of impartial judges could rate prospects based on that. Now, that's fair. It might cost an extra @@CURRENCY@@ or two, but can you really put a price on democracy? Hmm, I guess I just did, kind of."

5. "All this debating is giving me a headache," complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Daft Ideas. "Imagine all the time people would save if they didn't spend the day listening to arguments about tweaking the tax code or giving benefits to old people." He motions over to a window overlooking a lone activist spray-painting 'MAFTAOAL FTW' across @@CAPITAL@@'s main square. "I have an idea, what if we just stopped debating altogether? No meddling politicians, at all. Let the voters decide for themselves."

[b][anchor=761]#761[/anchor]: As Seen On TV [Cazalius lodra; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Classic TV fans have pointed out that the terrible events of the recent @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange bombing were strangely foreshadowed in long-cancelled shlock soap opera [i]"The Light of Day"[/i], sitcom [i]"The Flimpsons"[/i], and in a dozen other TV programs produced by the same media company.

The Debate
1. "Since we're outperforming the Intelligence community, you should make use of our talents!" suggests producer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sensing the opportunity for some great PR. "I figure that we've got our finger so tightly on the pulse of society that we've become psychically attuned to the zeitgeist of tomorrow. That's why subconsciously, our programming content can predict that which your so-called experts are oblivious to. We'll happily send you all our predictions for a small consultation fee."

2. "They're receiving information from elsewhere!" stage whispers @@NAME@@'s lousiest spy, Jason Bouring. "None of our agencies could have predicted the bombings, and I don't think it's likely mere TV producers could have made this string of perfect guesses. They must be in league with terrorists, maybe as spies sent from Blackacre. We must arrest them, and deal with these traitors harshly!"

3. "Don't you think the real problem is that intelligence services that can be beaten by a TV entertainment company?" asks Intelligence Agency Director Abbot Blackbriar. "Counter-terrorism measures need upgrading, and national security services need better funding. With more agents, rigorous training programs and more investigatory powers, we'll soon be better than the best. In fact, you should just assign me a budget, and leave things to me."

4. "The only obvious thing here is that it's all a coincidence," points out mathematician Khethelo Roberts. "There was no reasonable way to predict the @@CAPITAL@@ bombings, and frankly there's no reasonable way to predict terrorism at all. Best thing to do is to strip back security and intelligence services altogether, and give us taxpayers a break!" He yelps suddenly as black-gloved hands pull him into the back of an unmarked van.

The Issue
Turning up one bright Monday morning, you are met with a mob of angry janitors, delivery drivers, security guards and cleaners on strike after legislation for increased weekend pay was defeated for the sixteenth time. Given that all available office space is full of uncollected rubbish and smells faintly of Friday's lunch, a meeting on the issue has been held at a busy local cafe.

The Debate
1. "What do you think they're striking for?" asks a department office intern and student @@RANDOM_NAME@@, still half asleep from working weekends at a greengrocers. "Fair wages for antisocial hours, that's what! Do you know how many of us have to sacrifice our free time, our social lives and even our health for the same rate as someone doing a nine-to-five? Big business can afford to pay a bit more, so make them give us night shift and weekend workers extra pay!"

2. "Having to fork out extra for weekend workers would sink us," butts in nosy cafe owner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, slinging a sweat-soaked dishcloth at his girlfriend so she can take over. "Me and the old gal have to scrimp and save to pay for staff as it is! Tell you what, you lot cut back a bit on all those wage laws for us small businesses and I might even be able to take the old nag out somewhere nice."

3. "We never used to rush about like this when I was a young'un," interjects old-timer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, holding up a queue just to talk to you. "Nowadays no-one seems to have enough time for a cuppa and a chat. Why don't we go back to the good old days when you only had to work on weekdays, and everything closed at five? That'll give us all plenty of time to get to know each other properly, like back when I was a nipper."

[b][anchor=763]#763[/anchor]: Any Body For Science? [The 19th Century; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
A group of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ scientists have advocated loosening ethical regulations to allow scientists to perform research with live human test subjects.

The Debate
1. "Well, it is certainly difficult to find enough willing volunteers," argues Dr. Ezra Powell, who slinked into your office dressed in a crisp white lab coat. "Rare conditions such as Brancalandian Burps and @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Habitancy can only be found in a few individuals, and more often than not they refuse to take part in our studies! We need the government to step back and let us researchers decide who should and should not be tested upon, for the sake of medical science!"

2. "Don't listen to her, @@LEADER@@," pleads @@RANDOM_NAME@@, directing @@HIS@@ cries towards your potted plant. "Doctor Mengele blinded me with her so-called research! This is what happens when scientists think that they can do whatever they want. Surely you cannot just forget about the idea of consent! If anything, you should require a fully detailed consent form for any kind of medical procedure or treatment. If any scientists don't like it, just take away their funding."

3. "But what incentive would people have?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, taking a wallet and syringe out of @@HIS@@ bag. "It's obvious that testing on live subjects is a priceless opportunity, and that is exactly why we should place a price on it! Mandate that all participants should be paid, say, 5000 @@CURRENCY@@ per day while they are undergoing tests. This stops low-rate scientists from going overboard, [i]and[/i] it helps the poor. It's a flawless plan!"

The Issue
A recent survey of MPs in @@NAME@@ revealed that only 50% of them actually live in the ridings that they represent.

The Debate

1. "This is a disgrace!" shouts street protester and irate bird farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whilst launching some sort of squishy projectile at your front door with a handheld catapult. "How is someone who lives in Northern @@NAME@@ supposed to have any understanding of how people in Southern @@NAME@@ live? My MP lives hundreds of miles away from the good honest folk he's claiming to represent. Frankly, it's an insult to the electorate. The government must force elected representatives to live in the areas they're supposed to represent, or kick them out of office!"

2. "This is a democracy, remember?" argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was elected to represent the rural fishing folk of @@ANIMAL@@-by-the-Sea, despite living in @@CAPITAL@@. "I may not live in the rural wilderness right now, though I'll probably live there one day. But that doesn't mean I don't know anything about these places. I mean, I do have access to Kwikipedia, after all! Forcing me to resign is a slap in the face to the good people of @@ANIMAL@@-by-the-Sea and an insult to democracy itself!"

3. "There's always room for compromise," suggests noted centrist politician, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is known for attending as many government meetings as possible. "Obviously we need to have our politicians be knowledgeable about the areas they're representing, but we also can't deny them a right to choose their own place of residence. How about we instead compel all politicians to educate themselves about their chosen ridings? Force them to study the area's history, culture, and languages and actually spend some time there. Then, test them! Give them an examination to pass to prove they know their stuff! If they fail, then they can't run in that riding. After all, a little bit of knowledge never did anyone any harm."

The Issue
Yesterday, the plaintiff, defendant, and jury in a local court had to wait over five hours before the judge arrived late. Furious over the waste of their day, the jury decided to reconvene this morning and charge the judge with being in contempt of court and criminal negligence of a national position. Some are claiming that there is a scarcity of national magistrates throughout @@NAME@@, and the political establishment is convinced that something should be done.

The Debate
1. "I'm being disgraced!" pleads the judge in question. "The public boos me even though I was on the other side of @@NAME@@ yesterday morning doing another case! The statistics are dire, @@LEADER@@. There are not enough judges for a country of our size, and we're spread too thin. You need to appoint more colleagues for me on the bench. And while you're at it, get me a pardon already."

2. "I agree that more judges should be appointed, but how do we know they are not just motivated by power?" inquires your lawyer while fixing his suit. "Judges should be selected randomly like juries are. The only difference is that those who could be picked should be limited to lawyers and people who actually know how the law works. When a trial needs to take place, nearby people that fit the qualifications can be summoned and chosen from. I'll take an oath that nothing could ever go wrong."

3. "No, no, no, no, no! These are horrible ideas!" wails @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted anarchist, while burning a judge's robes. "The entire judicial system is an unjust use of brute force to suppress inherent human freedom. Abolish the judicial system and free us from the tyranny you politicians label 'law'."

4. "I say, that blubbering anarchist is on to something here, what!" realizes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Defense, while toying with @@HIS@@ monocle. "After wrangling unruly cadets, our valiant military officers should have no trouble disposing of court cases in lieu of overworked judges. That way, the courts will be under strict orders from you to do the job properly. And if people complain about it, why, it would be a jolly good workout for me to step and convince them that it's okay." @@HE@@ cracks @@HIS@@ knuckles and grins cheerfully.

5. "You all are not taking this seriously!" foams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Anger Management, while punching a hole in the wall. "You don't need to change anything. The only thing that should be replaced is that incompetent judge who arrived late! Fire the crook and replace her with someone that actually wants to take the job seriously! I don't care if that means judges can't sleep or eat or whatever it is besides doing their duty to @@NAME@@. Our judicial system is counting on their undying loyalty to the law!"

The Issue
Signing that international climate treaty all those months ago really put a feather in your cap, and in the cap of @@NAME@@. Stately banquets in Brancaland and numerous editorials on your progressive leadership; it really has been quite delightful. Today, however, a strongly worded letter from the treaty compliance commission arrived at your desk, asking you to detail how @@NAME@@ plans to fulfill its obligations.

The Debate
*1. "Well, we always knew this day would come," laments renowned business tycoon @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The important thing now is to ensure that the most business-friendly option is pursued. If we hook ourselves up to one of the established cap-and-trade systems, we can go shopping in the backwater signatory states and buy enough permits to allow @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ companies to continue producing at their current rates. Our industry won't technically reduce their emissions, but it's an 'international' treaty, right?" [[color=blue]Must have Private Industry[/color]]

*2. "Well, we always knew this day would come," laments renowned industry manager @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The important thing now is to ensure that the most industry-friendly option is pursued. If we hook ourselves up to one of the established cap-and-trade systems, we can go shopping in the backwater signatory states and buy enough permits to allow @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ companies to continue producing at their current rates. Our industry won't technically reduce their emissions, but it's an 'international' treaty, right?" [[color=red]Must not have Private Industry[/color]]

3. "Let's do this the right way, yes?" suggests @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, avid 'yes-man' and resident of a territory completely devoid of oil and gas. "If you want a tried and true method for reducing carbon emissions, you can't go wrong with a good old fashioned tax scheme. Yes, those territories with larger energy reserves and heavy industry will likely be impacted to a greater extent than those without, and socioeconomically it's bound to be somewhat regressive, but we have to consider future generations. We can offset the damages by investing the revenue in renewable energy and social welfare, yes?"

4. "There's another way", posits Balon Busk, the nation's foremost newspaper columnist on technology and fantasy fiction. "Carbon capture and storage technology has some great potential. Of course, kicking off new tech is always risky, so we'll need massive subsidies for investments in the right infrastructure and equipment. But if we get it to work, we won't need to reduce carbon emissions at all. We'll just put it someplace it won't do any harm and no one is likely to stumble upon it, like deep below the Misty Mountains or something. It's the epitome of eating your cake and having it too! Expensive cake, but still."

5. "This meddling in national affairs is sickening," howls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an energy sector advocate known for @@HIS@@ love of dramatic exaggerations. "Any one of the proposed options will decimate our economy, without having the slightest positive impact on the environment, probably. All the worthwhile companies will flee to more business-friendly jurisdictions, and @@NAME@@ will die a horrible and painful death; that's right, I said it: that treaty of yours will kill @@NAME@@. Who's going to appreciate all those flowers when everybody's dead, huh? Trash the treaty!"

The Issue
Transgender students at @@CAPITAL@@ University are up in arms after @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted Sociology professor, refused to use students' preferred pronouns. After being briefed on the minefield of multiple genders and microaggressions, you step outside your safe space to face the masses.

The Debate
1. "By refusing to call me by my preferred pronouns, @@HE@@ is denying my humanity!" cries a spirited student with no clear gender. "@@HE@@ is a transphobic person, using free speech as an excuse to cover @@HIS@@ bigotry. I don't feel safe on this campus anymore because of this. We as a society discourage the use of offensive speech all the time, which is why we don't allow racial slurs on our campus. Why aren't pronouns treated the same way? Misgendering should be a hate speech and those who do it should be fired from their jobs and liable for psychological damage!"

2. "Oh shut up, free speech is a cornerstone of our nation," bemoans the professor in question. "Restricting speech is how most authoritarian and fascist regimes in history began. First they'll come for your ability to use the pronouns you want, and you'll say nothing because you don't want to offend people; next, they'll come for the media! We cannot allow this to happen! I am not a bigot just because I refuse to address a transgender student with a made-up pronoun concocted by radical activists.

"I'm not just talking about eliminating gendered pronouns from our language, although that's really a no-brainer, I'm talking about eliminating any sort of possibly offensive descriptors.

[b][anchor=768]#768[/anchor]: Trouble Brewing [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
This morning's strategy meeting was brought to a grinding halt when you and your cabinet were subjected to the worst pot of tea you have ever had the misfortune of suffering. The leaves weren't properly brewed, the milk was skimmed AND powdered, the water was lukewarm, and the sugar bowl was full of salt...

The Debate
1. "Oh gosh @@LEADER@@, I'm [i]so[/i] sorry I don't know how to make your boiled leaf water," spits @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@, the ever-sarcastic secretary responsible for the offending brew.  "I was busy learning trivialities like typing, minute-taking, IT skills, and calendar organising.  How about you all drink Eckie-cola from now on, instead?  In fact, you should get rid of tea from the whole of @@NAME@@: it's a drink for old farts and fuddy-duddies anyway."

2. "Look, I'm the Secretary of State, [i]the damn Secretary of State[/i], I say, and even I know how to make tea properly," complains your elderly Secretary of State, pointing to the desk nameplate that says Secretary of State.  "The problem with young people today, well, besides being constantly glued to their Pear Phones, is that they don't know how to slow down and take their time.  We should make tea-making and kitchen skills a part of the national curriculum, and encourage all those teenagers and twenty-somethings to stop rushing around, and to appreciate a proper tea service."

3. "Pfft, slow-mo food and drink is so last century," mocks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Chief of Science, while digging into @@HIS/HER@@ microwave burrito.  "What you need is instant tea, in a can, with some sort of heating widget that triggers with the ring pull, and plenty of preservatives to make it last.  Once again, science has the answer!  So, shall I assign some government grants for food technology research, or what?"

4. "Oolongs for better tea?" giggles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your pun-loving Minister of Agriculture, and your Cabinet brace themselves for an onslaught of tea-related puns.  "Can we Matcha solution to the problem?  Can we Rize to the occasion?  Did you read that report I Sencha?  Did I get things down to a tea, my Darjeelings?"  In the face of blank faces and silence, @@HE/SHE@@ changes tack.  "Uh... anyway, coffee.  Coffee is easier to make and nicer.  Subsidise coffee growers."

[b][anchor=769]#769[/anchor]: How To Print Money? [Singapore no2; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
An independent study recently estimated that up to ten percent of all physical money in circulation is counterfeit.  The Treasury Department are greatly worried, both that the counterfeiters are still at large and that @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ could be being severely devalued over time.

The Debate
1. "The fake bills just keep coming and coming!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your excitable Chancellor of the Treasury, pouring out a suitcase of the counterfeit notes onto your desk.  "If we want to stop this, I'll need a special task force under my direct control, and a free hand to act decisively...  With that, I guarantee you we'll stamp out all forms of counterfeiting within a month.  Or maybe two.  Or however long it takes!"

[2]. "An easier solution would be to implant small RFID-microchips into our notes and coins," proposes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Gadgets, demonstrating a prototype to you. "This would ensure that all genuine money could be immediately verified by handheld scanners.  As an extra benefit, it'd be a lot easier to track the movement of cash if we need to." [[color=purple]Must have substantial scientific advancement OR IT Industry[/color], TBD and may not be correct]

3. "All that glitters is gold, and really that's all we'll need to know," mumbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a gold magnate.  "Wouldn't it be much simpler if a 1-@@CURRENCY@@ coin was actually worth one @@CURRENCY@@?  If you used gold coins instead, not only would the coins have intrinsic value, but counterfeiting would become profitless and thus non-existent."

4. "What a boring, utilitarian solution," yawns @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an uppity artist, who is currently painting a mural on your ceiling.  "The correct way should be to issue new notes and coins, and adorn them with elegant and intricate patterns.  Not only will they be hard to copy, but they'll look fabulous as well.  Only then will it be difficult for criminals to make a mould."

5. "What's so wrong with individuals making money?" questions a dodgy-looking stranger with ink stains on his hands.  "If the government can print money, then why can't private citizens?  It'd stimulate the economy, I reckon, by creating cashflow and hyperinflating the currency, or something like that.  Hyperinflation is something good, right?  Isn't that what free market economics means?"

[b][anchor=770]#770[/anchor]: Vaping Up A Storm [Kortza; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
E-cigarettes and vaping have been growing more popular, but some have expressed safety concerns.

The Debate
1. "I caught my son puffing mist from this weird device!" panics mother @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, holding an e-cigarette at arms length as if expecting it to explode in her face.  "I haven't tried it myself, but if you combine electricity with the dangers of nicotine, who knows what will happen?  We must stop people using them until there's been more research into their safety!"

2. "Mom, you have like, minus one hundred percent idea what you're talking about," retorts her son, fifteen-year-old @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, obnoxiously exhaling a cloud of berry-scented vapour into your face.  "E-cigarettes have have like, no bad stuff in them at all, so they're as safe to smoke as drinking water.  I mean drinking water is as safe as smoking these, not that you can smoke water... uh... you get what I mean.  In fact, they help people stop smoking.  Which is good, so I hear, though I've never actually tried smoking cigarettes.  Plus, it's really cool-looking.  I've been trying to impress that Julie girl with my vape hearts.  Anyway, don't cut me off, because I really like Julie.  Like really, really like.  You get me?"

3. "Nicotine replacement devices are reasonable to help with nicotine addiction," interjects Dr. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ in a paternalistic tone of voice, "and that's all that they should be used for.  People are too stupid to decide things for themselves: you need someone who has a brain to tell them what to do.  @@LEADER@@, if you have any respect for the moral and physiological well-being of our nation, I implore you to necessitate a psychiatrist's prescription for electronic cigarettes."

[b][anchor=771]#771[/anchor]: Drug Up The Prices [Outer Sparta; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
Bletchley Pharmaceuticals recently hiked up the price of Garatim, a once-affordable branded drug used to treat neurodegenerative conditions, to over twenty times its original cost. Sick patients have accused Bletchley of greedy practices, and citizens have begun to take to the streets, calling on the government to intervene.

The Debate
1. "Why is Big Pharma doing this?" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, opting to simply throw a megaphone at your secretary rather than speak through it. "I have taken this medicine for decades, but some selfish pharmaceutical firm wants to deny me the care that I desperately need! Am I supposed to spend all of my life savings just so that I can survive? Enough of it! We need the government to oversee all drug prices to keep things fair for everyone."

2. "This is much bigger than a handful of sick people!" rants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, majority shareholder of Chant Healthcare, almost spilling the vast contents of @@HIS@@ wallet onto the ground in @@HIS@@ anger. "This is about the free market, and how it drives innovation. Of course we make money off these drugs, but these profits are what give companies the incentive to develop these drugs in the first place! Take away that, and who would ever want to push the boundaries of pharmacological science again? The government should have no hand in this market, for the sake of our nation's health."

3. "The problem isn't price gouging, it's our healthcare system!" protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prominent socialist thinker, scowling at the furious businessman. "Solving this problem only eliminates a symptom, not the disease itself. Our healthcare system lets greedy pharmaceutical companies exploit society's disadvantaged. We must seize control of the means of drug production and outright ban private institutions from developing medications."

4. "It's all an elaborate plan!" exclaims Marty Stebeckli, the CEO of Bletchley Pharmaceuticals, revealing a sheet of paper covered in indecipherable text. "You're going to have to trust me here. Raising the price of Garatim was intended to put pressure on private health insurance companies, by forcing them to spend massive amounts for the drug. We're even giving it out for free to people that actually need it! @@LEADER@@, our intentions were pure. Perhaps the government should encourage this behaviour by handing all drug production over to my company?"

The Issue
Disaster! The organizers of a charity dinner you are attending have been forced to cancel a scheduled stand-up routine by Jerry Fallon, famous comedian and headliner, because he has not renewed his entertainer's license. During the commotion, several of the nation's great and good also in attendance have come to your table to argue their positions on occupational licensing.

The Debate
1. "This shows why we must end licensing once and for all!" splutters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Chairman of the [i]@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Freer Enterprise Committee[/i]. "I ask you, who do you think is best placed to decide who is qualified? Some stuffed shirt bureaucrat sitting in a comfy office in @@CAPITAL@@ or the employer? Leave it up to the free market to decide! If folks don't think much of a plumber, electrician or doctor then they'll vote with their @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@!"

2. "Don't listen to this laissez-faire claptrap," sneers consumer advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@, discreetly shoveling vol-au-vents into @@HIS@@ pocket. "Occupational licensing protects consumers from incompetence and harm. We should be expanding the scope of licensing! Just look at the shoddy workmanship on these table decorations!"

3. "My children's babysitter doesn't need a license to do a good job, but we obviously need to enforce certain standards for important professions where people's lives are at stake - like doctors," observes Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, President of the [i]@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Medical Association[/i]. "The best way to protect the public and to keep out the riff-raff is to require a letter of recommendation to the licensing board from established and respected associations, such as mine."

The Issue
While taking a photo with a journalist, you were interrupted by an enthusiastic supporter who promptly fainted in your arms. The journalist's article went viral overnight, turning the image of you and your fan into an internet sensation. The next morning, you were greeted by your intern, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, begging you to take a selfie with @@HIM_1@@ in the same pose. It turns out you've acquired a new fanbase. This raises a question - how can you turn this situation to your advantage?

The Debate
1. "All my classmates are so jealous that I get to work in your office," squeals your intern, gleefully posting the selfie in @@HIS_1@@ blog. "If you started a student organization to help you campaign online, we'd be queuing up to join! The best students are the ones who work hard for their futures. This'd give us another way to start working for yours!"

2. "More publicity means more scrutiny," murmurs your personal assistant, straightening your curtains. "We need to keep your online image squeaky clean. We should keep your public presence where it belongs - pre-prepared teleprompter speeches and draft-by-committee press releases."

3. "Woah, that sounds really, really boring," sneers your Chief of Staff, pulling your curtains askew again. "Look, give me some of your social media passwords. I'll dump some opposition research to get your fans really riled up. They'll make short work of anyone who tweets at you the wrong way."

4. "You have all these fans, and you want to manipulate them?" gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Bureau of Statistics and hobbyist street petitioner. "It would be far more valuable to know exactly who supports exactly what policies. With bots to scrape social media for all the hashtags and profiles you'll ever need, you can finally see every citizen the way they want to be seen - as a data point!"

It turns out the @@MAN@@ who cleans your office toilets is actually double-qualified as a real estate lawyer and an orthopaedic surgeon. In @@HIS@@ home-country, that is. In @@NAME@@, @@HIS@@ qualifications are not recognised. According to the rocket scientist that makes your sandwiches in the canteen, this is a common problem for immigrants across the land.

The Debate

"Allow foreign qualifications to be recognised here, and we'll have more doctors, lawyers, engineers and so on.

3. "You can't trust foreigners," states native-born and trained structural engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Don't get me wrong here.

Who knows what dangerous practices might be considered normal in their nations? If they want to work here, they have to gain OUR qualifications, so we can know they are safe. Otherwise, they can stick to pushing brooms."

[b][anchor=775]#775[/anchor]: Affirmative Election [Singapore no2; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
Recent elections in @@NAME@@ have resulted in yet another parliament with few racial or ethnic minorities. In response, several minority-interest organizations have been protesting for weeks on end outside your office. The ruckus has become so distracting that you tried to veto your grocery list. After realizing that this couldn't continue any longer, you have decided to give them an audience.

The Debate
1. "This tyranny by majority must end!" demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Macronesian protest leader, who claims to represent all 2500 Macronesians in @@NAME@@. "We have been trying to become members of parliament for most of our adult lives, but we have not won even a single seat. I insist that you permanently reserve a few seats for minority groups throughout our nation."

2. "That would not even begin to make up for the decades we spent suffering in silence," laments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an ethnic Moltovean who was unsuccessful in @@HIS@@ last three runs for a seat in parliament. "The current system obviously doesn't work. Why don't we just redraw the voting districts? We can arrange the borders in a manner that will ensure our parliament has a more representative percentage of minorities. Rather than having a few reserved seats, we could actually have fair elections that result in a diverse parliament. Of course, the nation's homogeneous rural areas might need to be, um, divided a little more creatively to allow our people to get elected there."

3. "These dreadful ideas would alienate a large chunk of our voting base," complains Speaker of Parliament @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was recently lampooned in the book [i]Stuff Ethnic @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ Like[/i]. "Furthermore, the proposals are completely unmeritocratic. No matter how much you spin it, if a candidate fails to meet the expectations of the voting public, the candidate does not deserve a seat. And besides, you've seen how those loutish Bigtopians conduct their own affairs. Do you really want those sorts of people in our government?"

[4]. "The proposed rules don't go far enough!" proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a devout follower of a very small sect of Conspiritivism, sporting a tin foil helmet and insulating robes. "If minority races get to have special considerations, it's only fair that we have them too.

[b][anchor=776]#776[/anchor]: Fake News, Everyone! [Nation of Quebec; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
Journalistic pieces filled with falsehoods have been popping up all over the internet recently, especially on social media.

The Debate
1. "Lousy so-called 'journalism'!" exclaims the highly intelligent but often forgetful @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an aging journalist. "Fake news is a blasted scourge and an insult to real reporters everywhere. Whatever happened to the good old days when the media reported the truth and nothing but the truth? No lies, no political bias, and no freedom to spread incorrect opinions. Of course, it might not reach today's hip young audience, but we can't let subjective thoughts ruin the press. Ban these fake news sites and arrest these ridiculous conspiracy theorists!"

2. "I'm from @@NAME@@, and that's why I deserve my free speech!" rages Alexander Jonas of the controversial show [i]My Info Struggle[/i]. "People should be able to say whatever they want. The truth is, I'm a hard-hitting, fact-seeking, freedom-lover! The government has no right to declare that my journalism is any less valid than the hacks you see on television. People deserve opinions from people that aren't a part of the bureaucratic elite, from independent sources that they can trust. You should be cutting taxes for shows like mine, because the government needs critics to stop corruption dead in its tracks!"

3. "No matter what you decide, someone is going to be unhappy," notes Trevor Oliver of [i]The Weekly Moan[/i], a news satire program. "Allowing fake news spreads ignorance and fear, but clamping down on it harms freedom of speech. You'll note that before each of my shows, there is a disclaimer stating that this isn't real news and shouldn't be taken seriously. Couldn't you simply force the fake news sites to openly state that they're fake? Sure, the government would be able to decide which sites should and shouldn't be coupled with a warning, but the people wouldn't be easily tricked any more."

The Issue
During a family dinner, your brother - who is well-known for his fondness for slot machines - bemoaned the fact that his favorite casino was going out of business. The next day, you found out that he has secretly arranged to have several major casino owners meet you in your office.

The Debate
1. Edward Rump, owner of the failing casino, shakes your hand for an awkwardly extended period of time. "There are so many problems for honest businessmen like me. That's what they're all saying. Believe me, the worst is the terrible zoning and property laws in our nation today. The worst. We need to have our casinos in the best places to reach the very very best people. These laws are destroying our nation. Bigly. Without them, it'll be amazing. Only the best, I'm telling you. You'll have so much money, you'll be sick of money."

2. "No, you've got it all backwards," says 'Portly' Pete Russo, board member of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Gambling Commission, while lighting a cigar. "What's killin' us are those taxes of yours. They're highway robbery! Shift the tax burden from us to income tax and I bet we'd be able to increase our operations and bring in even bigger hauls that'd more'n make up the difference. Seriously, I'll give you two-to-one odds, what'd you say? Anyway we're the lifeblood of the economy, and you wouldn't want to be the one responsible for bumpin' off an industry that nets ya so much dough, now would ya?"

3. Your brother, who has been eavesdropping the whole time through your office door's keyhole, interrupts the group. "How about instead we use tax money to purchase credit for casinos and then distribute that credit to every taxpayer? That way they're basically getting a tax break and there's an incentive for people to try these really entertaining games. Oh - totally unrelated - but could you lend me some money again?"

The Issue
Hugh Jass, @@NAME@@'s most famous TV foodie, drew a lot of criticism when he visited a world-class restaurant in yesterday's episode and gorged on expensive gourmet foods in a manner that some viewers found too "appetite-stimulating." Mr. Jass' extravagance was said to be particularly disrespectful to millions of poor @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizens who could not afford one of the dishes he ate with their entire monthly salary.

The Debate
1. "How inconsiderate!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a labourer whose love for TV is accentuated by @@HIS@@ square-framed eyeglasses. "While my family subsists on beans and rice, this guy shamelessly sups that fancy pasta and mushroom thing. My children ask why we never eat white Brancalandian truffles. What can I tell them? @@LEADER@@, please ban these TV foodie shows so that our children will not have to grow up feeling self-conscious about our financial circumstances."

2. "Mon dieu!" grumbles Mr. Jass, sniffing his croissant, and throwing it away untouched. "Do these wretched ignorami not recognise the worth of a good [i]tagliolini con tartufo[/i]? 'Pasta with mushrooms' indeed! If these peasants have neither the means nor aspiration to appreciate vicarious high-quality culinary culture, they can simply change the channel. I render a valuable service to our economy by giving publicity to our first-class restaurants. So, how about the government picks up the restaurant bills for our gastronomic journalism? I'll cover the service charge, of course."

3. "Ahem, please excuse Mr. Jass' terse reply. He adores all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@. I'm sure we can find a compromise," mutters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the producer of Mr. Jass' show, awkwardly fidgeting with @@HIS@@ gold watch. "Rest assured, we can arrange to cater for the needs and desires of our under-resourced viewers. Perhaps you could incentivise Mr. Jass to show that he understands all his demographic, and should occasionally visit more affordable restaurants. What do you say?"

4. "This is pathetic," sneers Robin Wood, an advocate for equality, picking up the extra croissants on Mr. Jass' plate and tossing them out of the window to the huddled masses who anxiously await your decision. "These poor, benighted workers fail to question why they are unable to afford these fancy foods in the first place. It's because of this hideous income inequality! @@LEADER@@, redistribute our great nation's wealth and give a standard salary to everyone, no matter their job! No more, no less!"

[b][anchor=779]#779[/anchor]: We're Dying For Your Business [Pigeontree; ed: Ransium & Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A recent exposé of the death care industry revealed that funeral costs are leaving some families dead broke. The reason for the price increases is thought to be because while population growth continues to rise, funeral parlour growth has stopped cold, resulting in shocking cases of price gouging. Demand for last rites has become so high that families sometimes have to pawn all of the deceased's possessions just to afford a simple burial.

The Debate
1. "Dying is not something we have a choice in," weeps a sombre woman dressed all in black. "The tragic death of a loved one followed by an astronomical bill landing on our doorsteps can put families' finances in a death spiral. I urge you, @@LEADER@@, to scrap death charges altogether and provide state-funded funerals for everyone. That way families won't have to mourn their bank accounts as well as their loved ones."

2. "Yes, and do you know why there's a shortage of funeral services, hmmm?" quietly seethes funeral director Igor Fronkensteen, while dragging a lumpy burlap sack behind him. "Burial plot land costs...they are rising, yes? The price of insuring a hearse these days is, how do you say, absolutely ludicrous, yes? And the restrictive laws on 'adequate refrigeration' and 'treating the dead with dignity' all are running our margins and my salary down! You want more funeral services at a cheaper price, you should ease up on the bureaucracy, yes?"

The Issue
A collection of shoppers and business owners have gathered outside your office to protest over the current levels of value-added tax - the sales tax that is applied to products and services at the time of purchase - also known as VAT.

The Debate
1. "It's outright theft, I say!" exclaims business owner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while restocking a display with mugs exhibiting your image. "Why should the state leech off my success? I've had customers walk out of my store in a huff because the VAT jacked up the prices. The government could easily make money through other kinds of tax instead of harming my business. I say we get rid of this ridiculous VAT altogether and let our economy thrive without limits!"

2. "Are you mad?" scoffs bureaucrat @@RANDOM_NAME@@, twirling @@HIS@@ bespoke pen. "Do you have any idea how much the national treasury takes in through VAT? It helps pay for all kinds of things! Education, welfare, defence, and so on. The point is, this form of tax is a very valuable part of our taxation code that, if removed, would leave many public works bereft of funds. I say we increase VAT, and use the funds we raise to reduce the despicable income tax that bleeds the hard-working people of @@NAME@@ dry."

3. "As always, there is a third option," muses a passer-by with a voice of confidence. "There is no doubt that this tax disproportionately affects the poor, but we also can't deny that it helps fund programmes that the poor themselves benefit from. Might I suggest reducing VAT on basic necessities while increasing it on luxury items? The rich might not like it, but it's high time that they paid their dues to society and their fellow citizens."

Albinos - born with an absence of pigment in their eyes, skin or hair - suffer a lot of medical problems as a result of their condition.

"Ignorance and superstition are to blame for all this, so let's stamp them out. Raise awareness about what albinism is and isn't.

[b][anchor=782]#782[/anchor]: Sit-Down Money [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
With traffic congestion on the roads of @@CAPITAL@@ reaching unbearable density, labour unions are demanding that employees be paid overtime wages for time spent in traffic jams.

The Debate
1. "Have mercy on us, @@LEADER@@!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, honking @@HIS@@ car horn right under your window. "I've been stuck in this damned traffic jam for so long I've forgotten what my children look like! It is inhumane to spend four hours every day just trying to commute to work and back home! I deserve to be paid overtime wages to compensate for the stress I endure!"

2. "What is this noise?" asks your secretary @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Karoshi, crawling out from under @@HIS@@ desk, still wrapped in @@HIS@@ blanket. "Tell these softies that nobody is forcing them to drive back home after work. People whose homes are far away from work should be encouraged to sleep over at their offices and only go home once a week or so. This would also help boost their company loyalty. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to take a quick shower. The garden sprinklers are on, right?"

3. "I'm not sure why it's government business what our corporate pay structures are," observes well-rested CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose commute involved a 15-minute private helicopter trip. "The labour unions always have one demand or another, but we can deal with these problems with hardball negotiation, judicious hiring and firing, and failing all else, water cannon. How about government stays out of it, and lets us resolve these pay disputes our own way?"

[4]. "This doesn't make any sense," mutters your shy teenage nephew almost inaudibly, hiding his face behind his uPad. "Being physically present at your school or workplace is so outdated - and unnecessary, if you ask me - thanks to the latest developments in technology. You should ban the commute, and subsidise remote working. People can just attend classes online or communicate with their colleagues via Trype. This will solve the traffic problem, and also help reduce the social anxiety that some people might feel in face-to-face interactions." [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

[b][anchor=783]#783[/anchor]: Sergeant McCool Reporting For Duty [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Gossip magazines have exploded into a frenzy after news broke that famous teen idol @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ "Squeaky" McCool is being conscripted into @@NAME@@'s military.

The Debate
1. "I heartily welcome this man to the force," dead-eyed military recruiter @@RANDOM_NAME@@ utters in flat monotone. "Sergeant McCool failed to pass his initial examination, and he exited through the wrong door. But these are minor obstacles every soldier can learn to overcome. He will enter training immediately, and I am sure he will be proud to serve in the front lines with the other grunt... fine @@DEMOYNMADJECTIVE@@ men and women." 

2. "NO! He's going to DIE!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a 45-year-old who gives @@HIS@@ current profession as 'Squeaky's Number One Fan'. "@@LEADER@@, you can't let Squeaky get killed. Can't you just, well, refuse him? We Squeakers need him so much. He supports all kind of charities: [i]Dinner-Dance for the Destitute, Masquerade for the Pox-Marked[/i]... Say, if he paid you some of his millions, couldn't that be seen as a surrogate to actual service?" 

3. "This the pretty boy that's due in?" rasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from the shadows, riffling through gossip magazines and military files. "He should already be physically fit at his age. In neighbouring countries, kids of seventeen, fourteen, six, can already disassemble and reassemble a rifle, crawl along the ground on their knees and elbows and take out a sniper... normal stuff." @@HE@@ pauses to show you a video of unknown origin, which appears to depict youngsters playing cops-and-robbers. "Our imitation of conscription has failed to instil healthy @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ values into our people. We must widen the net and make the training harsher." 

4. "When an engineer joins, we put them to work fixing stuff," explains Army logistician, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, moving a battalion of toy soldiers from one side of your desk to another. "Why not use this pop singer's talents? We'd welcome him into the Army, but never put him on the front line. Instead, he'd fly from base to base singing to adoring uniformed fans, pose for recruitment posters, and go on TV to praise the glory of our great nation. He will serve beautifully."

[b][anchor=784]#784[/anchor]: The Driving Force [Petreniax; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
With @@NAME@@ committed to reducing its carbon footprint in accordance with the International Climate Treaty, many are asking if encouraging hybrid engines and electric cars might help.

The Debate
1. Ebon Flask, the oddly-named CEO of Nikola Automobiles, is sitting on the corner of your desk, bursting at the seams with excitement. "Hybrid engines are the future! You'll see lower emissions, and drive the growth of new industries. I'm not saying that we should ban the gas guzzlers, of course, but perhaps we could encourage new ways of thinking?" He leans over slightly. "Like maybe increase road tax on polluting vehicles, then subsidise eco-friendly ones? After all, making these cars is a bit expensive..."

2. "Forget this hybrid stuff; my boys in the lab are working on a full-electric engine," interjects Evan Mask, the strangely similar-looking CEO of Edison Industries. "That would get rid of fossil fuel dependence all together; and with renewable energy generation we're talking unlimited travel with no negative effects. All you need to do is ban petrol stations, and build lots of plug-in charger stations in their place. Oh, and you're going to need lots of wind turbines too. One every hundred yards across the country should do it."

3. Soccer mom Alana Messc offers you her opinion about the situation. "People across the nation have different opinions. So why don't you allow free choice in a free market? Let's have gas, hybrid, [i]and[/i] electric cars. I'm rather partial to my gasoline-powered minivan: it does just fine when I'm taking the boys to practice. But I know my husband wouldn't mind a hybrid, and my oldest is interested in an electric car, so it's a win-win-win. Of course, we could use an income tax break to be able to afford all those vehicles..."

4. "You hear that? Her GASOLINE-POWERED vehicle is doing fine. We don't need these greenies ruining the economy with their snotty ideas anyways," asserts Eton Muscat, lobbyist for @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Petroleum. "Do you know how many jobs there are in auto manufacture and oil refinery processes? Do you know how much harm you'd do if you wreck these industries? Discourage ideas like hybridization and electric cars, for the sake of compassion. Oh, and let's quit that dumb climate treaty while we're at it."

5. "That's the face of corporate evil, right there," whispers radical environmentalist Egon Mist, pointing not just at the oil lobbyist, but at all four of the previous speakers. "@@NAME@@ needs to free itself of this culture of seeing ecology-destroying transportation as a right. Our ancestors got around fine on foot, and never needed to travel more than a hundred miles from the place of their birth. Get rid of them all: cars, trains, buses, planes, and anything with an engine. That's the way back to a greener and better world."

[b][anchor=785]#785[/anchor]: Born To Be My Baby [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
When @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ and her husband couldn't conceive, they employed a surrogate to bear a child for them, using the father's sperm and the surrogate mother's egg. However, after the baby was born, the surrogate mother refused to give up the child and is battling for permanent custody.

The Debate
1. "This kid gets 50% of his genes from me. Surely that counts for something in a court of law?" questions the intended father of the baby, holding his wife's hand. "My wife has ovarian cancer; she can't have children and a surrogate was our only choice. This woman was paid a considerable amount for the job of carrying our baby. Now she says she wants to keep our child? Utter nonsense! As Justin's biological father, I demand that we be given custody!"

2. "There is no way you can take my little Justin from me!" yells @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the surrogate mother, letting the baby dangle on the handcuff strapped around her wrist. "I am his biological mother! Men do not understand the bonding that mothers experience with their children at birth! That guy who claims paternity rights just because he gave me his sperm has no such bond with Justin. They can have the money back, but they can't have MY son!"

3. "As always, science will provide the solution to this dilemma," states John Piaget, a developmental psychologist from the University of @@CAPITAL@@. "Just bring these people to my lab. We'll put the baby in one corner of a room and the mothers in two different corners. Then we'll record the eye movements of the baby - whichever woman he looks at the longest, gets the parental rights to Justin. We could even use this method during bitter custody battles!"

4. "That's a terrible idea. Nobody should put baby in a corner!" grumbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the director of @@CAPITAL@@ Minimum Security Orphanarium, cradling a baby in @@HIS@@ arms, while two other toddlers clutch at @@HIS@@ clothes. "Our institution is overflowing with poor orphans. Wouldn't it be better if you just provided financial incentives, perhaps paid for with a small tax increase, for infertile couples to adopt?" Taking advantage of your momentary absent-mindedness, @@HE@@ puts the baby on your lap. "Speaking of adoption, would you like to take care of this adorable little girl? I think she likes you."

[b][anchor=786]#786[/anchor]: Tainted Tattoos [Nuremgard; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
There has been a rise in infection rates across the country from unsterilized tattoo needles. Health advocates have called on the government to impose safety standards on tattoo parlors across @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "This can't go on!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Health and Safety Board. "The government needs to regulate tattoo artists and ensure that minimal health and safety practices are being followed. Otherwise, we'll have a full-blown crisis on our hands. Did you know that some tattoo artists don't even sterilize their equipment? That's risking all kinds of disease!"

2. "This is ridiculous!" exclaims tattoo artist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ inks one of your staffers with a skull tattoo. "Why punish all of us because a minority don't use clean needles? We need less state interference, not more. Word of mouth, not government regulation, will put the ones who infect their customers out of business. It's common sense!"

*3. "It's about time this country banned body modification altogether!" condemns controversial religious speaker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Tattoos, piercings, and - ugh - fake nails, are all disgusting and offensive against the Creator. Holy books from all religions clearly indicate that this modification is a sin. Put some funding into religion and religious education instead to bring forward these lost souls so we can show them the true path of righteousness." [[color=purple]Must lean towards being religious[/color]]

*4. "The only people who wear tattoos are criminals and gangbangers," reminds police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who heads the Gang Warfare division of the @@CAPITAL@@ police force. "It's about time we banned tattoos and other bodily modifications. They give people this idea that they're 'cool', which leads them towards a path of crime. Banning them will reduce crime, and make it tougher for the gangs to identify each other. That makes my job easier." [[color=purple]Must lean towards being secular[/color]]

[b][anchor=787]#787[/anchor]: Come Fly With Me [Thyerata; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
A recent Air @@NATION@@ flight departing from @@CAPITAL@@ Airport was overbooked, resulting in the violent removal of a passenger. After legal scholars were unable to find any clear consensus about passenger rights within the nation's existing laws, you have been dragged in to make a decision.

The Debate
1. "Now look here," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the injured passenger, speaking to reporters from @@HIS@@ hospital bed. "I paid top @@CURRENCY@@ for that seat, and yet those horrible police officers thought I should be dragged off the plane just because the airline hadn't properly planned for the amount of people who would want to fly that day. It's unfair. I say that if we pay for a ticket, we should be allowed to fly on the airplane. It's that simple."

2. "But we do plan!" sputters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Chief Operations Officer of Air @@NATION@@, as @@HE@@ strides into your office without an appointment and knocks your transportation advisor out of his seat. "Virtually every flight has cancellations and no-shows to balance out the overbooking. We just had an abnormal influx of passengers for that particular flight. Yes, we also needed to put a few of our own employees on the flight, but that's completely irrelevant. I say that we should be allowed to throw passengers off the plane if we have to - and if they won't go willingly, they should have to deal with the consequences."

3. "Why do we even have airplanes in the first place?" asks elderly protestor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a "Just Plane Stupid" banner. "Airplanes are noisy, polluting monstrosities that are prone to frequent maintenance delays and flight cancellations. I say we should get rid of airplanes and invest in public transport... by which I mean domesticating the @@ANIMAL@@ and teaching people to ride them."

[b][anchor=788]#788[/anchor]: Duel Purposes [Singapore no2; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
You are having an early morning discussion with your Finance Minister about Maxtopia's recently enacted sheep tariffs when a sword-wielding maniac jumps into your field of view.

The Debate
*1. "Hello, my name is Count Mount Crystal," monologues the saber-brandishing hooligan, who seems rather familiar for some reason. "I was given a life sentence for false charges of high treason. I lost my wealth, property, and custody of my children while in prison. However, I managed to escape, and I am here to settle a score. Prepare to die!" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

*2. "Hello, my name is Count Mount Crystal," monologues the saber-brandishing hooligan, who seems rather familiar for some reason. "I was exiled for false charges of high treason. I lost my wealth, property, and custody of my children after I was forced to leave @@NAME@@. However, I managed to return, and I am here to settle a score. Prepare to die!" [[color=blue]Must not have prisons[/color]]

3. "Excuse us, 'Count', but we were in the middle of a discussion of national importance!" fumes your Finance Minister, trying to shoo the miscreant away. "This just demonstrates the uncouth nature of conflicts being settled by two people waving big sticks at one another. We should ban dueling of any sort, have disputes once again settled via the legal process, return to our riveting discussion, and avoid entertaining this cretin."

4. "How undignified!" reprimands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an economic advisor, tut-tutting at the entire scene. "Why must we insist on solving disagreements through violence? Instead, how about a nice game of chess? Don't ban dueling altogether, just make it take a more intellectual form."

**5. "All of you are ignoring the big picture!" exclaims Judas Elgar, a legal consultant. "This clearly indicates that our judicial system is in need of a major overhaul. If we allow juries again, judicial oversight would be a thing of the past, and malicious malefactors like him would receive a fair trial and wouldn't be knocking upon your door and threatening you in the hot light of morning." [[color=purple]Must not have juries[/color]]

6. Several security guards burst forcefully into your office, almost destroying your front door in the process, as the 'Count' ducks behind a pillar. "We are deeply sorry for our failure to protect you!" apologizes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Head of Security, grabbing your arm and hastily leading you out of the room. "Clearly, allowing dueling to solve political disputes will quickly deplete us of all our leaders and politicians, including you. You just have to ban people from challenging politicians to duels, and call it a day."

[b][anchor=789]#789[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: @@CAPITAL@@gate [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
In a clandestine operation, your Propaganda Ministry and Intelligence Services have been wiretapping the offices of government critics and the headquarters of the opposition parties. The most prolifically targeted individual is recently elected representative Barry Maxman, a dashingly handsome author and political journalist, who is a determined enemy of your government. Unfortunately, Barry caught on, which gave him fresh ammunition for his latest magazine articles agitating against your leadership. He's dubbed this the [i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i] scandal, and is holding it up as an example of your "many abuses of power." You have convened your advisors in an emergency meeting.

The Debate
1. "This is bad. How in the name of Violet did this happen under your watch?" asks Gordon MacGruber, your Chief of Staff, as he frantically points at an anti-government newspaper with the headline '@@LEADER@@ Must Go!'. "We must categorically remind the people that you were not involved and disavow anyone who has been named in the scandal. We need to cover up this mess as much as we can while we distract people so their minds are focused elsewhere. Stay strong, @@LEADER@@, we've got this covered."

2. "@@LEADER@@, I implore you! If you help me, I'll help you launch the perfect counter-attack!" exclaims Propaganda Ministry aide Virgil van Houten, who was named in the scandal. "Exonerate me and put me in charge of handling the investigation. With more wiretaps and more covert surveillance, we'll be able to find something scandalous on this guy and discredit his claims of corruption. With Maxman facing [i]ad hominem tu quoque[/i] attacks, you'll emerge stronger than ever!"

3. "Instead of working against Mr. Maxman, why not work with him?" suggests Frankie Willis, your Minister of Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows. "Barry is pretty popular, and it wouldn't hurt you to borrow some of his credibility. We... no... YOU need to apologize to him, along with anyone else who was victimized, and work with him to improve your public image. I bet you'll find that you'll survive this scandal much better by playing nice as opposed to acting belligerent. Who knows, he might even have some good ideas on how to actually run this country!"

[b][anchor=790]#790[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: The Art Of The Distraction [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
The @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal has gone viral, and you have decided to distance yourself from the people involved.

The Issue
The @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal continues to be front page news. Facing continued scrutiny and criticism, several of your closest Cabinet ministers and aides have suggested doing something to distract the people from @@CAPITAL@@gate.

The Debate
1. "The people are clearly angry because we haven't gone far enough!" exclaims Gordon MacGruber while continually squeezing a stress ball. "Dismiss anyone involved in the scandal from their posts, and don't stop there. Take a stand by prosecuting the corrupt career politicians and the lobbyists, and ensure that there's always a free press to ask tough questions. Once @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ see how none of this was your fault, they'll surely forgive you! Just make sure you appear sincere in your efforts."

2. "Nothing distracts the people more than a good dosage of fear from an even bigger enemy," reminds your Minister of Defense, while quickly leafing through a book entitled [i]Political Corruption For Dummies[/i]. "You've read my reports of those pesky East Lebatuckese infiltrating Marche Noire, right? What if we started rumors about something similar happening here? We could claim that the East Lebatuckese have agents in @@NAME@@, and we could even come up with some sort of agency to track them down. People will be so scared they'll turn on each other and forget all about us!"

3. "I hate to say 'I told you so,' but I told you so!" rebuffs Propaganda Ministry aide Virgil van Houten, as he emerges from his hiding spot in your coat closet. "To be honest, the only one who truly understands @@NAME@@ is the person who has been running it. We need to start cracking down hard on the media, protesters, and that pesky Barry Maxman just like I said. It's obvious that he's engaged in un-@@DEMONYM@@ activities. You come up with some trumped-up charges and I'll plant the evidence."

[b][anchor=791]#791[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: The Smoking Gun? [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
With the @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal heating up, you have authorized increased surveillance against government critic and opposition politician Barry Maxman, in an effort to find something scandalous to discredit him.

The Issue
Intensified snooping into Barry Maxman's personal life has revealed his preferred brand of cereal, what times he goes to the bathroom, how often he walks his poodle named Violet, how much he spends on post-it notes, and whether he wears boxers or briefs. What it hasn't revealed, however, is any salacious material or defamatory evidence, leaving you with the dilemma of how exactly to proceed with the campaign to discredit one of your most vocal critics.

The Debate
1. "Damn this guy is clean! Barry Maxman doesn't even have an overdue library book!" exclaims a rather frustrated Virgil van Houten, who now heads the Propaganda Ministry. "It's obvious what we need to do - make something up! If the people see a strong leader smacking down a pesky troublemaker like Barry Maxman, then surely they'll fall in line! Heck, we could even use this method to target more people we don't like!"

2. "I disagree! The smarter thing to do is consolidate your position," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a young intern with a hint of ambition in @@HIS@@ eye. "Pass laws that give you more power, and fire anyone who makes you look bad, including those who were named in @@CAPITAL@@gate. Let no law or government initiative pass without your approval. After all, only YOU can be trusted to run @@NAME@@ effectively, perhaps with the assistance of some previously unknown young guns. The gullible fools will eat it right up."

3. "Hmm... if Maxman seems too much of a goody-goody to be true, he probably is," muses Director of State Security @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a bug detector wand around your office. "He's almost certainly an East Lebatuckese infiltrator, out to destabilize our fine nation. The reason why there's no evidence is because East Lebatuckese spies are good at covering their tracks. What we need is to set up [i]The Committee On Un@@DEMONYM@@ Activities[/i] to assess the loyalty of everyone in @@NAME@@, including journalists and politicians who are a little too critical or annoying."

[b][anchor=792]#792[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: Why Can't We Be Friends? [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
In the wake of the @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal, you shocked @@NAME@@'s political establishment by deciding to work with Barry Maxman.

The Issue
Barry Maxman, despite being targeted by rogue officials in @@NAME@@'s government, has agreed to meet with you personally. After being escorted by his own private security, he has arrived at your office, ready to state his demands for reform.

The Debate
1. "Thank you for agreeing to meet with me," remarks Mr. Maxman, after handing you an autographed copy of his latest book, [i]Johnny's Government[/i]. "Now let's get down to business. What I want, and I suspect many @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ agree, is ridding this government of corruption once and for all. Scumbag corporate lobbyists and dirty politicians infest your government - they must all be arrested! You also need to guarantee freedom of the press, and ensure that the government will never again spy on private citizens in any way, shape or form. Finally, you personally must apologize for letting things get this bad, and agree to full government transparency forevermore."

2. After Mr. Maxman leaves the room, you confer with a few close associates. "If you want to make sure scandals like this don't happen again, you need to consolidate power around yourself," suggests your brother, a personal admirer of Blackacre's Supreme Leader. "Pass a law that requires all laws, directives, and operations to go through you. You'll be seen as a strong leader who keeps an ever-watchful eye over the government. There's no need to give into Maxman's demands. If the Party backbenchers and opposition don't like it, they know where the door is."

3. One of your more sinister advisers approaches you and whispers in your ear. "We have Maxman in our grasp! We need to arrest him now before he goes off the radar. You can even spin it that you tricked the traitor into letting his guard down by inviting him to meet with you. Now that's a win-win solution! Well, not for Maxman, I suppose."

[b][anchor=793]#793[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: Knock Knock. Who's There? Not You Anymore! [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
In a stunning move, you have fired scores of politicians, hundreds of staffers, and dozens of department heads who have had allegations of corruption against them in the wake of the @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal.

The Issue
The halls of government are silent. Not a creature is stirring, not even a lobbyist. It is becoming increasingly difficult to govern @@NAME@@, and the few politicians who remain have gathered to address these concerns.

The Debate
1. "My sources are telling me that it's being reverently called '[i]The Purge[/i],'" declares your personal secretary, who is now doubling as your Finance Minister. "'I think that people have bought the way you handled the @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal and that you had nothing to do with it. This is the perfect time to call for a new election. That should ensure that you'll be elected in a landslide, and not to mention it'll help you find a replacement for me. I'm not cut out for all this financial mumbo jumbo."

2. "Now is not the time for a costly and divisive election," reminds your Minister of Keeping Things Real, one of the few cabinet ministers who still has @@HIS@@ job. "We should bring back some of the people we dismissed. Why not rehire the people who were let go for the most trivial of offenses? We can't run the country like this. We can still pass your reform bill, but right now we need more people, and a proper budget, to make @@NAME@@ run efficiently again."

3. "Have you ever considered that things are just fine the way they are?" suggests the [i]North @@NAME@@ Libertarian Party[/i] Chairperson, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You know, the government was so bloated you probably had no idea where one ministry began and where another ended. No wonder @@CAPITAL@@gate happened right under your nose. Fewer politicians and ministries suckling on the taxpayers' collective teat can only be a good thing. The best government is a small government, and it's much more efficient."

4. "Well you've cleaned house, but there's still one thing you haven't done," observes Barry Maxman, who is currently in the process of writing a tell-all book about his ordeal. "Even if you say you weren't directly involved in these corrupt activities, they still happened under your watch, and under your administration. I suggest that you take responsibility for once in your life, and throw yourself in prison. It's the morally right thing to do. Remind the people that nobody is above the law, not even you."

[b][anchor=794]#794[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: Fear And Loathing In @@CAPITAL@@  [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
You decided to greenlight [i]The Commission On Un-@@DEMONYM@@ Activities[/i], an organisation with the purported goal of rooting out East Lebatuckese spies and agitators within @@NAME@@.

The Issue
There are many lingering questions about the Commission, and it is now looking to you for direction and strong leadership to set its path in the days ahead.

The Debate
1. "Now is the perfect time to strike against anyone who might oppose you!" giggles Virgil van Houten, throwing a knife at a poster of Barry Maxman. "The polls are in, and the people are behind you. We all agree that something needs to be done about the 'East Lebatuck problem.' Let's round up anyone who is on the government's 'Enemy List' and execute the lot of them for treason. Kill them all! Barry Maxman, we're COMING FOR YOU! HAHAHA!" He picks up your butter knife and makes several stabbing motions.

2. "Executing Maxman and his followers will only make us look guilty," reminds your rather shocked policy adviser. "If we start executing anyone who criticizes the government, there'd be nobody left. It would be easier to encourage citizens to snitch on each other, and gather all the rumors, accusations, and smears into a secret database. With that 'evidence,' we can subtly blackmail and bully anyone who opposes us into silence."

3. "I couldn't care less about this [i]Committee On Un-@@DEMONYM@@[/i] whatever," yawns your tired and lazy brother, who always looks for the easy way out. "There's always a simple solution to these problems. What if we release a list of suspected spies, and then announce that patriotic citizens won't be prosecuted for taking national security into their own hands? Say, with a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire, in a dark alley. That should take care of the Maxman problem before we visit mother next weekend..."

4. "There probably are REAL East Lebatuckese spies lurking in @@NAME@@, hidden deep undercover," replies secret agent James Bont, back from a successful mission that thwarted a cat-loving supervillain's plot for world domination. "I seriously doubt this Maxman is one of them. What you should be doing is investing in the spy agencies and police, so we have the proper funding and equipment to catch these guys. Background checks on all citizens would be a good place to start. Sure, it doesn't really solve the scandal, but the people's minds will be more focused on whether their neighbor is a spy, not some scandal that's yesterday's news."

The Story So Far
Barry Maxman has been arrested on charges of terrorism and treason.

The Issue
Now that Barry Maxman is languishing in a prison cell, it's up to you to decide what to do with him. However, there are many in your government who have their own ideas...

The Debate
1. "Barry Maxman is a terrorist and a traitor to our glorious @@TYPE@@!" declares @@RANDOM_NAMEMALE@@, your Interior Minister, wearing no shirt and a black hood over his head. "We will show @@NAME@@ and @@REGION@@ that we do not tolerate these ingrates in our nation. We must burn his books and execute him in @@CAPITAL@@ Square for all to see! That'll send a message to any of Maxman's sympathizers! I'll execute the bugger myself, if you'll just say the word."

2. "Killing Maxman is all well and good, but having him rot in prison would send a far more powerful message to anyone who has the audacity to challenge you," points out Virgil van Houten, who is arguably one of the most powerful people in @@NAME@@ right now. "The image of a broken-down Maxman in an orange jumpsuit would be a constant reminder to anyone else who might get some crazy ideas. There's nothing like fear to keep the people in check!"

3. "There is always room for compassion," advises your mother during her monthly visit. "Executing Mr. Maxman sends a terrible message and makes us no better than the tinpot dictatorships that we're supposed to be condemning. Pardon him and give a good speech about how compassionate you are. You gave him and other dissidents a good scare. He'll surely toe the government line now."

4. "If the people want a face-off with you and Maxman, let's give them one!" gleefully suggests Lucy Commodus, your assistant who happens to be an avid historical reenactor. "Why not a televised sword-fight to the death with you and Maxman at @@CAPITAL@@ Square? We'll dull his blade and slip some sedatives into his water to make sure you win. Not only will this take care of the Maxman problem, but you'll look like a badass at the same time."

[b][anchor=796]#796[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: It's Dangerous To Go Alone! [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
To prevent another scandal from happening under your watch, you consolidated power around yourself, making sure nothing happens in the government without your knowledge.

The Issue
Your newfound authoritarian streak has your influence increasingly growing in @@NAME@@. You now have a unique opportunity to solidify your power base and take control of the nation. Your innermost circle has conferred to advise you on the best path to take...

The Debate
1. "It's dangerous to go alone. Take this!" enthuses your Chief of Staff, thrusting a pen into your hand. "Here's a new piece of legislation that will outlaw all elections in @@NAME@@ and keep you in power for the rest of your long and prosperous life. Everything would be so much easier without pesky things like debates, checks and balances, and voting getting in the way. This is for the prosperity and security of our great @@TYPE@@!"

2. "You're nuts! That's a sure way to get you assassinated," scoffs your chief strategist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, known for infamously punching a journalist who asked too many questions. "The real problem in this country is the fake news media. After all, they're the ones who caused this fake scandal to get as big as it did. Let's dismantle it and set up our own state-controlled news. Imagine how much easier things will be when WE control the message!"

3. "As Mockiavelli said, it's best to rule by fear," loosely quotes Virgil van Houten, who many regard as the true power in @@NAME@@. "Eliminate the people's so-called right to privacy so we always know what they're saying and doing. We could even set up anonymous tip lines for people to report their family and neighbors for suspicious activity! We can identify problematic people, then swoop right in and take care of them before they get out of hand. This is for national security!"

4. "All of you are nuts!" exclaims opposition politician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as your bodyguards struggle to hold @@HIM@@ back at your doorway. "It's good that you're taking steps to improve the government's reputation after @@CAPITAL@@gate, but becoming an authoritarian despot is hardly the way to do it! If you want a true test of how the people feel about you, call a General Election, and prove you have a democratic mandate! That will win more hearts and minds than tyranny ever will."

[b][anchor=797]#797[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: Yesterday's News [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
It has been some time since the @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal, and many are reflecting on what the scandal's place in @@DEMONYM@@ history should be.

The Issue
The @@CAPITAL@@ District Schoolboard has decided to update their @@DEMONYM@@ History course to include recent events, including the @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal. The scandal is still fresh in people's memory, and those who were involved in the scandal have their own ideas on how it should be taught in schools.

The Debate
*1. "The lesson from history is absolute power corrupts absolutely, and government cannot be trusted," points out Barry Maxman, whose new novel chronicling @@CAPITAL@@gate recently topped the best seller list. "@@CAPITAL@@gate was about unchecked corruption, censorship, and your gross incompetence. We must remember @@CAPITAL@@gate, to make sure that no other person is intimidated the way I was. That should be its legacy." [[color=blue]Must not kill dissidents[/color]]

*2. "The lesson from history is dissidents must die, for the sake of the nation," points out your Interior Minister, wearing a t-shirt depicting Barry Maxman's grave and the caption 'We Got Him.' "@@CAPITAL@@gate was about a hack author and a traitor to this great country who was planning attacks against us. He made up the idea of this so-called scandal to try and turn the people against you. We must never allow people like Barry Maxman to have that kind of sway in @@NAME@@ again. Dissent will never be tolerated. That should be its legacy." [[color=red]Must kill dissidents[/color]]

3. "The lesson from history is that traitors and terrorists are always hiding among us," exclaims Virgil van Houten, who is widely expected to replace you one day. "[i]The Commission On Un-@@DEMONYM@@ Activities[/i] continues to hunt down the enemies within as we speak. It shows just how much the people are willing to sacrifice for the good of the nation. @@CAPITAL@@gate proved that when there's a threat to @@NAME@@, the people will always unite and rise up against it, even if that threat is a fellow citizen." 

**4. "The lesson from history is the free press safeguards democracy," reminds media baron @@RANDOM_NAME@@, handing out free newspapers to everyone in the room. "If it weren't for the media, we might never have found out about the government's shady dealings. @@CAPITAL@@gate reminds us that the free press must be protected at all costs, otherwise a dictatorship just might be around the corner." [[color=blue]Must have Free Press[/color]]

**5. "The lesson from history is that only the government can be trusted to tell the truth," reminds @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your new Propaganda Minister, after burning the last remaining non-state newspaper in @@NAME@@. "The so-called @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal was nothing more than a fabrication of the press. They created this fake scandal because of their personal vendetta against you. That is why we had to step in. Now the people know that they're getting the truth from our state media. After all, allowing all those opposing ideas would be absolute chaos." [[color=red]Must not have Free Press [/color] / [color=red]Must have State Press[/color]]

***6. "The lesson from history is that democracy is the best form of government, for all others have been tried," states your sister, who now works as a democracy advocate throughout @@REGION@@. "This was a healthy reminder that we need to be a nation that freely elects its leaders, and we won't allow some dictator to walk all over us. You chose the noble path, dear @@LEADER@@, and we'll continue to make sure that @@NAME@@ is respected throughout the land!" [[color=blue]Must have Elections[/color]]

***7. "The lesson from history is that an iron fist will always achieve better results than so-called democracy," states your brother, who enjoys his new extravagant lifestyle. "This was a healthy reminder that @@NAME@@ needs a powerful leader to run it, regardless of what anyone says! You took the opportunity to seize power and crush the opposition. All praise our glorious Leader! Hail @@LEADER@@!" [[color=red]Must not have Elections[/color]]

8. "The real question is why is this being taught in schools at all?" queries an eager young intern, who literally worships the ground you walk on. "Yeah, @@CAPITAL@@gate isn't exactly a bright spot in @@NAME@@'s history, but you know some of these teachers will use it as propaganda against you. It's best if we all simply forgot about it, and ban any teachings or depictions of the scandal from here on out."

[b][anchor=798]#798[/anchor]: A Periodic Issue of Elementary Nature[Island of Stability; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
Your Science Minister has convinced you to go to a party being thrown by @@NAME@@'s leading scientists to celebrate the successful synthesises of a new element at @@CAPITAL@@ University. The element itself decays within microseconds, but that hasn't stopped the party from dragging on for hours. Your attention has finally been sparked as a massive debate over the name of the element has broken out. The situation threatens to become as unstable as the element itself, and people are looking to you for a solution.

The Debate
1. "I believe the answer to this issue is as simple as polynomial quadratic expressions to those possessing acceptable levels of neural tissue," yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the leader of the research team responsible for the discovery, while attempting to disrupt the gaggle of boffins around @@HIM@@ by swinging @@HIS@@ phone wildly and playing lightsaber noises. "It should be named after me. I discovered it after all. That makes it the optimal method to utilise when naming newly created elements."

2. "I disagree with that hypothesis," begins @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the Advanced Superheavy Synthesis and Electrochemistry Society in a calm monotone whilst sipping from a glass of dihydrogen monoxide. "The correct name for this element would be Unseptnineteenbillionium in accordance with the regulations of my organisation. Any other name would only inhibit clarity to chemists across the world." Whilst saying this, @@HE@@ unravels a periodic table and writes a five-letter symbol in the position of the new element.

3. "I have an even better idea," claims your cousin, using a megaphone to be heard over the sodium-level volatile debate now occurring at the party. "Why not name it after you? This element could make us well known as the scientific leaders of the world! Besides, who else is more worthy of such an honour? In fact, why not extend it a bit further and name every element after glorious leaders of our nation?"

4. "Woah, woah, woah!" gasps an increasingly incredulous undergrad, who happens to be passing by a window on the way to the library. "How the heck are we supposed to remember anything about it from names like that? We should name the elements after what they actually do! Like this new one can be called 'Lastslessthanamillisecondium'. That'll make it way easier for us all to make any sense of this stuff."

[b][anchor=799]#799[/anchor]: A Political Cock-Up [Iraines; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
A low budget film allegedly showing junior government minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in a compromising (though technically legal) position has gone viral on social media. Concerned individuals, especially parents, are loudly voicing their opinions on the matter.

The Debate
1. "Touching that and then shaking hands with you?" gasps local parent and averred shoplifter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while discreetly watching the infamous video on @@HIS@@ phone. "We can't have people like that on television addressing the public, or anywhere else in government for that matter! Besides, you deserve better than to have your good office be sullied by such an immoral individual!"

2. "Booting them out of their job won't do any good for our country. If anything, they'll just go down as a martyr to their fellow deviants!" rants affluential religious talk-show host @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I've subjected myself to constant, repeated study of the sinful actions of this filthy reprobate, and as far as I'm concerned the only way to teach degenerates like this a lesson is through proper punishment. A thrashing maybe, or a good old-fashioned stoning in the town square!"

3. "Don't you think this is taking things a bit far?" queries the minister in question, nervously. "It's a low-quality video and that could be anyone's... Okay, it was me. But I don't do it anymo— Okay, I still do it, but it's biology that made me this way! Can you blame biology? @@LEADER@@, you can't deny that I satisfy you with the job I do, so why should it matter how I spend my leisure time?"

[b][anchor=800]#800[/anchor]: Please Call 1-800-NTA-VRUS, Your Government May Be Compromised [Luna Amore; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue 
One of your interns unintentionally infected government computer networks after @@HE@@ called a 1-800 number on a popup and gave the scammer remote access to the computer. While IT tries to sort out the damage, your team is divided as to what to do about the situation.

The Debate
1. "It was a very convincing warning!" sobs the intern responsible who is feverishly resetting @@HIS@@ passwords to Passw0rD1. "I thought our national security was at stake! Why didn't our antivirus stop it? Why are we so vulnerable? Why am I the only one crying? We need to install better protection like the Fortons, Maxphos or McCafes. Better yet, all three!"

[2]. "I've been lobbying your administration about this for years," chastises Pear Inc CEO, Steve Tasks, dramatically sliding an ultra-thin tablet computer from a manila envelope onto your desk. "Your systems need a complete overhaul. Unlike those clunky UBM dinosaurs, Pear products never get a virus, with end-to-end protection provided by my company. Just gaze in awe at the Pearbook Vapor. See how sleek it is... And it's so light and thin, you could take it anywhere. I hear Manamana's beaches are wonderful this time of year." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

[3]. "Government computers are not for looking up @@ANIMAL@@ memes," chastises Stafford Brewer, head of Distribution Cybernetics. "They're for allocating collective resources as efficiently as possible, scheduling party meetings and keeping tabs on counter-revolutionary behaviour! Rip out these decadent capitalist contraptions and install government networked terminals in every distribution hub across the country. We'll be more efficient, and safer, than ever." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "What codswallop!" exclaims your head of IT, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, yanking an unencrypted USB drive from your computer. "Why go wasting millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ on a band-aid fix? Shiny new computers don't help if the problem is the idiot behind the keyboard. We need to lock down these machines. Every Sam, Dick and Martha intern should not have administrator rights on these machines. Lock them down."

5. "This scammer business has gone on long enough," growls military intelligence officer Colonel Flagg while sizing up everyone in the room. "They hide outside our borders in East Lebatuck taunting us with this bull hockey. Enough is enough! Give us the authorization and we'll smoke these bastards out at the source."

6. "Hello I am from UBM Technical support" chirrups a tinny voice as you answer your phone. "We have noticed that your system has multiple viruses on it and we are here to help. If you could just log in please and visit our website where you'll be prompted to enter your bank account number, passwords, mother's maiden name and pin numbers we will repair your systems for you."

[b][anchor=801]#801[/anchor]: Animation Provocation [Montagna; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
When media boss Ian Tivruski green-lighted a new Brancalandian animated series for the [i]@@DEMONYM@@ Kids Network[/i], he thought he was commissioning a delightful children's show about metal-working amazons who knit cozy jumpers for their grandkids. As it turns out, the surprisingly explicit animation [i]Sword Heroins: Love Needle[/i] has caused a lot of confusion amongst young viewers, and upset many parents.

The Debate
1. "Innocent children's minds need to be protected from such corruption," declares noted moral guardian Maria Polytunnel. "To achieve this, we should set up a Children's Regulatory Animation Panel, with me as its fully-paid leader, of course. We can then deem what is and what is not suitable for broadcast."

2. "Should we blame these images on TV? No! Blame Brancaland!" declares angry mother Sheila Brelufski. "We should send tanks, and planes, and soldiers to the Branclandian borders, threatening war unless they stop making this filth!"

3. "I don't get why people are complaining, to be honest," dissembles Tivruski defensively. "Clearly, we added 'Sword Heroins' to our line-up to educate children about the dangers of peer pressure, drug abuse, and challenging everyone you vaguely dislike to a duel. Let us broadcast what we like when we like, even if it does challenge the tastes of some of our more easily offended viewers. Stand up for free speech, and endorse our decision, @@LEADER@@."

4. "I think we're ignoring a broader issue here," bemoans frustrated animator Parker Stonetrey, "which is that animated art forms are never taken seriously enough to be considered anything more than kiddie fare. I say that we develop @@NAME@@'s artistic vision and creativity by subsidising adult animation. When people think @@NAME@@, they should think Hentai!"

[b][anchor=802]#802[/anchor]: No Lock, No Gun Stock, And No Smoking Barrels [Jutsa; ed: Ransium] [/b]

The Issue
Last night, a colonel checking the inventory at Fort @@ANIMAL@@, @@NAME@@'s largest military armory, found only a broken musket and a giant hole in the wall that @@HE@@ was pretty sure wasn't there earlier. There is a strong suspicion that this heist is linked to certain groups that have been raising a stink over @@NAME@@'s gun ban. 

The Debate
1. Commandant @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, the head of the breached facility, shows you a large schematic of a dense mass of mostly incomprehensible sketches, including a drawing of what appears to be a giant killer robot. "What we really need is to have more funding for security. We simply can not allow our weapons to be stolen, let alone potentially sold to the rebellious public. We need better security. In fact, our security facilities need their own security facilities. Sure, it'll be expensive, but it'll be worth it."

2. Your Minister of Law and Order draws a large, red X across the schematic. "This kind of thing doesn't exactly happen in a vacuum. We should focus on discouraging others by capturing the crooks who broke into our base in the first place. In fact, if we really want to get to the root of the problem, we should boost our national law enforcement to investigate and arrest anyone who is promoting the idea of guns being returned to our citizens."

3. "This wouldn't be a problem if guns were given back to the public," comments the somewhat sheepish looking colonel, while wadding the schematic into a ball and tossing it aside. "If our populace were armed, then they'd have less incentive to steal our weapons, except for the really cool ones I suppose. Plus, they'd have an easier time defending themselves in an attack."

4. "You've got it all backward!" interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a @@MAN@@ in fencing gear, who appears to have wandered in on the conversation. "These things were banned from the public for a reason - they are dangerous! We need to extend the present ban to the military - if they have a real problem, they can just use swords. Observe!" @@HE@@ skewers the crumpled schematic with @@HIS@@ rapier.

[b][anchor=803]#803[/anchor]: Park That Thought [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive] [/b]

The Issue
It is widely recognised that @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are significantly smarter than the world average. There have been calls for the government to make use of this national resource.

The Debate
1. "Science! Progress! A Better Tomorrow!" sprays frazzle-haired twenty-something geek @@RANDOM_NAME@@, mouth half full of cold pizza. "We're living in a changing economy, and the future lies in fuzzy logic and quantum computing. I'm not talking about a discrete quantity of computing... aha... ha... ah... Hmm, tough crowd. Anyway, the government should fund a Science Park to push forward the boundaries of technological thinking, and to shake up the status quo. It's an investment in the industries of the future!"

2. "Clever is as clever does," declares frazzle-haired thirty-something PhD student @@RANDOM_NAME@@ smugly. "Governments and world leaders, you always want to monetise things, when actually intelligence and learning are their own reward. Instead, you should fund a Symposium Park, where ideas can be exchanged, poems can be written and minds can grow. No, there's no money in it. It's not all about money, you know."

3. "Clever? There is no clever..." intones frazzle-haired forty-something philosopher @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We are thinking too much about thinking and not enough about mindfulness. Give us some land to build a Meditation Park. Discourage this mad world-questioning and worship of intellect. Embrace introspection and spirituality, and grow our souls."

*4. "So we're an oh-so-clever nation, and now you want to build a national park celebrating that?" moans frazzle-haired fifty-something cattle breeder @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Give me a break! Help me out with setting up a Ranch Park where we can raise good quality cattle. IQ doesn't fill bellies. Beef fills bellies." [[color=blue]Must not have Vegetarianism.[/color]]

*5. "So we're an oh-so-clever nation, and now you want to build a national park celebrating that?" moans frazzle-haired fifty-something farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Give me a break! Help me out with setting up a Soya Park where we can intensively farm that most versatile bean. IQ doesn't fill bellies. Soy cheese fills bellies." [[color=red]Must have Vegetarianism.[/color]]

[b][anchor=804]#804[/anchor]: Motivational Posters [Omakhandia; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
A @@MAN@@ was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter yesterday. Over an extended period, @@HE@@ encouraged @@HIS@@ online acquaintance - who suffered from depression - to end his own life, which @@HE@@ subsequently did.

The Debate
1. "If this @@MAN@@ can be put on trial for @@HIS@@ words alone, what's next?" queries one of your younger advisors, texting you from a seminar on meme ethics. "We shouldn't be in the business of policing what people can and can't say. Yes, @@HE@@'s a terrible, terrible person; I mean, who does that, seriously? But this is much bigger than @@HIM@@. I urge you to pardon this @@MAN@@ immediately, and promote true freedom of speech and expression."

2. "We can't have people pushing others to suicide and getting away with it," calmly states your former Minister of Homeland Insecurities, who has taken up a career as an anti-cyberbullying activist. "Is it not our responsibility - as a society - to protect impressionable and vulnerable people? Now, if you ask me, this @@MAN@@ is not some sadistic monster, but @@HE@@, and others like @@HIM@@, need to learn that actions have consequences. Let @@HIM@@ face @@HIS@@ punishment, and divert some funding to provide for a national awareness program teaching people that their words actually carry weight."

3. "Obviously, both of these people were severely disturbed, and we all know what got them there," asserts your chronically under-stimulated Minister for Medieval Fairs, clad in motley, as is @@HIS@@ custom. "If anything, this is a wake-up call. @@NAME@@ needs to get rid of the internet altogether. Newfangled communications methods, with their instantaneity, clearly desensitize people and can make a troll out of the best of us. Not the 6 hit dice regenerating kind, mind you, the other sort. With the internet gone, people will have the time to truly reflect on their words, and nothing like this will ever happen again. Truly, it's a small price to pay for the well-being of our nation."

[b][anchor=805]#805[/anchor]: Solving A Dissolving Dilemma [TBA; ed:  Pogaria] [/b]

The Issue
Following several months of political squabbling, there is concern that the incumbent legislature in @@NAME@@ is no longer able to function efficiently. As a result, some have been questioning if voters should be allowed to dissolve the parliament and call for a new election.

The Debate
1. "This government is ridiculously ineffective!" exclaims Leader of the Opposition @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who appears to have snuck into your office while you were out for lunch. "It's a well-documented fact that not even members of the majority party are satisfied with the current parliamentary leadership. Citizens should be able to initiate a referendum to dissolve the legislature! Let the people decide what the future of @@NAME@@ will be."

2. "This is obviously an absurd notion," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the current Minister of the Interior. "@@NAME@@ has had a regular election schedule for ages, without any major catastrophes since that incident with Mr. Scruffy. There's no need to muck it up by constantly dissolving parliament. The voters elected us for a full term of office; to serve anything less than that is anti-democratic."

3. "If you ask me, the power to dissolve the legislature should only be wielded by our glorious leader," asserts infamous sycophant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the author of [i]1001 Paeans to @@LEADER@@[/i]. "In the capable hands of such an august personage, this awesome power can be used as a safeguard against those elected crooks in our parliament. I'm confidant our supreme protector wouldn't dare abuse it." @@HE@@ continues to stare at you in adulation as security escorts @@HIM@@ out of your office.

[b][anchor=806]#806[/anchor]: Unlicensed To Kill [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM@@ Medical Association has declared that participating in a lethal injection is a violation of medical ethics and grounds for revocation of license to practice. Following this development, a recent execution had to be postponed when all medical personal with the appropriate credentials to administer the execution refused to participate.

The Debate
1. "Acck! Vat a bunch of babies!" exclaims Dr. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, your Minister of Mad Science, wearing @@HIS@@ trademark blood-splattered lab coat. "Zey can't even put murdering maniacs to death? Sure, my doctorate might be in zeoretical physics, but I've been performing quite a few dissections of late; I'm sure I could figure out how to administer a simple IV drip."

2. "I have an easier solution," utters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@CAPITAL@@'s no-nonsense Chief of Police. "Make it the law that doctors have to participate in whatever medical procedures the government asks for. If those hippies want to continue to make their silly protests, you could make make sure they are 'Punished' with a capital 'P', if you catch my drift. Poetic justice, eh?"

3. "When are you going to accept that there is no good way to kill people?" yells Dr. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, head of the @@DEMONYM@@ Medical Association. "That doctors refuse to participate in the act should tell you something of the act's value. Stop fooling yourself into thinking you're 'executing people humanely', and join the rest of the civilized world in outlawing the barbaric practice of capital punishment once and for all."

4. "Why don't we give ownership of the punishment back to the wronged parties?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a stressed-looking accountant working the Justice Department's quarterly budget. "As in, get victims or the families of victims to administer the punishment. Just give them some syringes and needles, tell them which common domestic products are poisonous, and let them work it out for themselves. I mean, I expect they'll kill the convict [i]eventually[/i], and it'll be a really cheap fix."

[b][anchor=807]#807[/anchor]: Have War Crimes, Will Travel [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed:  Caracasus] [/b]

The Issue
A small disputed strip of land in your sphere of influence has been in a state of civil war for decades. @@NAME@@ has been approached by the international community to hold the first round of peace talks. Unfortunately Colonel Idi Amore, the self-styled revolutionary in charge of the Popular Freedom Fighters with multiple warrants for war crimes against him, will have to be issued a safe conduct pass to attend the talks without fear of arrest.

The Debate
1. "The Popular Freedom Fighters are a disgusting group!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a grief-stricken refugee."They killed my father, razed our village, and ruined my stamp collection! I say you invite their jerk of a leader into @@NAME@@, then you have your police arrest the monster! It's the only way justice can be served."

2. "You can't seriously be considering this!" exclaims overworked diplomat @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We've been working for years to bring peace to this region. He may have blood on his hands, but so do the other sixteen sides in this war. A sudden power vacuum will just prolong the hostilities! We have a real chance of securing a lasting peace here, surely that's worth overlooking a couple of mass murders?"

3. "This really is a bind," muses your trusted advisor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If we arrest him on our soil, we will forever be known as people who breach our safe conduct passes. If we let him go, we will let a wanted war criminal slip through our fingers. The solution is plain: refuse to hold the talks. I'm sure they can figure it out without us looking over their shoulder."

4. "We want this warlord gone, but don't want to look bad because of it," whispers Agent Cobblepot from behind an oversized potted plant. "Give this individual safe conduct, let him do his thing and if some kind of terrible accident were to befall our dear friend... how could you possibly have known that ceiling beam was going to fall on his head?"

[b][anchor=808]#808[/anchor]: Big Trouble In Little Dàguó [Laeral; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The large, militaristic nation of Dàguó is currently in a dispute with the breakaway province of New Dàguó. As nations around the world begin to take sides, opposing ambassadors have arrived in your office to seek your support.

The Debate
1. "This 'New Dàguó' is nothing but a treasonous cartel of hoodlums and degenerates," scowls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the ambassador from the Empire of Dàguó. "We are one of your most important trading partners, especially for your @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ industry. We demand affirmation as the one true and legitimate government of Dàguó. Don't believe the lies those criminals tell you - our Holy Emperor, long may he live, provides true prosperity and success to all of his citizens. Besides, we might just have to take military action against those who support the so-called New Dàguó - and you want to be on the correct side in this coming war, don't you?"

2. "We deserve recognition!" asserts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the self-proclaimed ambassador from New Dàguó. "We are a democratic nation that holds free elections in our territory. Dàguó's tyrannical regime was oppressing us, so we declared a revolution! Sure, they outnumber us ten to one, but if you send us weapons and support, we'll become fully independent in no time! We'll even pay you back after we figure out how to import enough food without Dàguó's price controls."

3. Your Minister of Foreign Affairs, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, comes up to you and whispers in your ear. "Look, @@LEADER@@, we can't afford to lose our trade with Dàguó - our @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ industry would collapse! But we also shouldn't turn a blind eye to Dàguó's flagrant human rights abuses. How about we send a vaguely-worded statement saying that we support a peaceful solution to the conflict, and then just say that we supported the winning side all along? It's a no-risk solution."

4. Later, your seldom-seen Minister of Whispers appears behind you in what you thought was a deserted corridor. "We have an exceptional opportunity here, Your Excellency. It would be easy to discreetly sell weapons to both sides while remaining officially neutral. Our enemies in Dàguó will become increasingly unstable, while we profit from the situation. Some may call these actions unethical - but @@NAME@@ didn't start this conflict. We're just acting in the best interests of the realm, of course."

The Issue 
Mounting scientific research shows the fishery stocks across territorial waters are plummeting, with the possibility of whole fisheries collapsing in the near future.

The Debate
*1. "There is only one reasonable thing to do," proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Fish. "We must immediately introduce limited fishing quotas, add restrictions on catch size, and punish any violators harshly! There simply aren't enough fish to go around. I'm afraid the fishing industry will just have to take one for the school." [[color=blue]Must allow Alcohol[/color]]

*2. "There is only one reasonable thing to do," proclaims your Minister of Agriculture and Aquaculture, looking up from a paper splattered with red ink. "We simply can't allow ourselves to sink more funds into an industry that's about to go belly up anyway. Gut the fishing fleet, so that their capacity only matches sustainable fish harvesting levels. You can shift the funds to retrain the crews for other jobs to ensure no one's livelihood is threatened. The boats can carry tourists and vacationers instead."

**3. "Hold on there, matey!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the Trawler and Angler Trade Union of @@NAME@@. "Surely there are plenty of fish in the sea, at least in the remote, international waters of @@REGION@@? The government must subsidize a massive fleet of full sea trawlers.

5. "There is inadequate data to know with such certainty fisheries are in danger of collapse," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, contrarian professor in the Department of Marine Studies and Fin Cuisine at University of @@CAPITAL@@ while reaching for a slice of lemon. "Maybe it's been a rough few years for our gilled friends for reasons other than the millions of fish we catch a year. The only thing to do is collect more data. Keep things as they are and continue to monitor fish intake. If fish catches continue to decrease over the next two to three hundred years, then we can be sure we have a problem."

The Issue
A small countryside skirmish against a score of bandit militiamen ended in a complete catastrophe, despite the deployment of two dozen @@DEMONYM@@ battle tanks and one hundred and fifty infantrymen. The @@DEMONYM@@ conscripts proved to be no match for their well-trained and motivated enemies. Unsurprisingly, the perceived quality of the nation's soldiers has come under heavy fire.

The Debate
1. "Hang on, which end is it that we point at the bad guys?" asks clueless Private @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, haplessly staring down the barrel of an assault rifle in genuine confusion. "I give up! Look here, @@LEADER@@, I'm just not cut out to be a soldier, neither is anyone else in my unit. You have millions of men who couldn't hit the side of a barn with a battle tank main gun, even if the tank was parked in the barn! Couldn't you let us prove our pride in our glorious nation by doing some good instead, like tending to the elderly, cleaning up the streets or peeling potatoes?"   

2.  "Our military isn't what it was in the good old days," comments retired Drill Sergeant @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "You should revisit basic drill and training. Concentrate on the fundamentals, like disciplined formation marching to the beat of a drum, standing up straight, keeping your uniform shiny, and having abuse shouted in your left ear."

[3]. "As always, technology has the answer!" announces computer programmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pausing halfway through level 242 of Call of Honor to talk to you. "With the latest targeting computers in our military equipment, even a child couldn't miss! An interlaced augmented reality overlay and combat AI could tell soldiers in real time squad and enemy locations, ranges, wind speed, optimal weapon selection, tactical movements, inspirational morale boosting messages.... It's modern warfare!" [[color=blue]Must have computers[/color]]

4. "I think your approach is already correct," wheedles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your sycophantic aide-de-camp. "In fact, the only issue we have is that we don't conscript enough soldiers! With greater numbers, victory would be assured. For starters, I'm sure the elderly and the disabled would be proud to serve our great nation."  

5. "Or you could go back to having a volunteer army," mutters @@RANDOM_NAMEMALE@@, hand-cuffed deserter and sole survivor of the recent massacre. "Look, I didn't want to be a soldier anyway. I wanted to be... [i]a lumberjack![/i] Leaping from tree to tree as they float down the mighty rivers of... of... Anyway, ditch the draft."

The Issue
While strolling through the annual bake sale at your niece's school, you couldn't help but overhear a heated argument between two of the mothers at a nearby snickerdoodle-and-cupcake display.

The Debate
1. "@@RANDOM_FIRST_NAMEFEMALE@@, I don't care how much kale you put into those cupcakes; we just shouldn't be feeding this much sugar to children," lectures one gaunt-looking mother, waving a carrot in exasperation. She catches a glimpse of you out of the corner of her eye and turns to you. "@@LEADER@@! You must regulate all junk food going to our children at school! If we need a fundraiser, we can sell fruits and vegetables instead of this high-calorie, low energy bull-"

2. "Oh my, @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAMEFEMALE@@, you must watch your mouth! There are children in here!" complains her dumpling-shaped counterpart, hip-bumping her way to a centre-stage position in the conversation and sending the previous speaker flying into a tower of rice cereal treats. "You can't get rid of this sugary goodness! These kids love it. If anything, we need MORE sugar, and some help for businesses that provide the sweet treats that bring so much happiness. Who cares if people are gaining weight? That's just evolution."

[3]. "Evolution? That's what this is about?" interjects @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAMEFEMALE@@, local Violetist and busybody, showing up from behind a display of savoury doughnuts in the shape of a Violetist religious symbol. "The Holy Purple Passages state that 'Sweetness Is Not Virtue, and You Shall Not Consume the Fruit of the Cane.' Maybe that's not exactly correct, but you get my point! Ban desserts entirely!" [[color=blue]Violetism is legal[/color]]

4. "AAAAAAAAAAARGH!" screams your niece, causing everyone to suddenly turn to her. "Thank you! Who cares what kids eat? It should be our choice alone if we want to eat cookies and candy all the time, not yours! Give children the choice to put whatever food we want in our bodies, it's the only way!"

The Issue
A recent survey of @@NAME@@'s politicians has revealed that a majority of them identify as "old @@DEMONYM@@ men of @@FAITH@@". The same study revealed a significant lack of female politicians, especially in your Cabinet. Angry social activists have demanded that you take immediate executive action or face the consequences next election.

The Debate
1. "Whatever happened to making sure the best person gets the job?" queries your old school friend and high-ranking Party MP, @@RANDOM_NAMEMALE@@, who always surrounds himself with buxom blondes during [i]Question Period[/i]. "It ain't broke, so don't fix it! If these womenfolk want to get elected, then more qualified candidates should step forward. Hell, if they weren't always whining about gender equality and the so-called glass ceiling, people might take them more seriously."

2. "I've always said that Parliament needs a woman's touch," notes @@RANDOM_NAMEFEMALE@@, a small-town mayor who wrote of her national ambitions in a book entitled [i]You Shouldn't Need A Member To Be A Member[/i]. "As I've mentioned countless times before, @@NAME@@ must rid itself of its old boys' club. Introduce quotas that mandate 50% of all political and Cabinet positions be reserved for women. This will ensure that all voices are heard, not just the privileged few."

[3]. "Perhaps the reason why more women aren't entering politics is because they have a naturally lower tolerance for corruption," twitters pop psychologist @@RANDOM_NAMEMALE@@, whose doctorate is in floristry. "If the government began cracking down on the rampant ministerial corruption, you'd start seeing more diversity emerge organically. There'd also be gradual attrition of the behind-the-timers, and when they want to leave...well, they know where the door is. That has to be better than forcing it." [[color=purple]Must have high corruption[/color]]

4. "Silence!" bellows black-latex clad dominatrix @@RANDOM_NAMEFEMALE@@, as she flicks at the previous speaker's calf with her whip. "These pathetic little steps are a start, but don't go nearly far enough! It's high time these mansplaining politicians in their ivory towers faced the same kind of discrimination that we face on a daily basis. If lessons are to be learned we must be severe: restrict the number of male politicians harshly. Ensure these puny males afford proper respect to their female superiors. And no more talking over women, shouting about things about which they know nothing. Such errors will be corrected most assiduously."

5. "Hold on! What about an option that doesn't discriminate?" asks your cleaner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sitting on your desk with surprising ease for a @@MAN@@ of @@HIS@@ advanced age. "Need I remind you all that sortition doesn't discriminate? Male and female, young and old, @@DEMONYM@@ or immigrant, it doesn't care. Everyone will get their, albeit short, time to serve.

The Debate
1. "We cannot underestimate the danger!" asserts your Minister of Defense, carefully putting @@HIS@@ Castles & Cockatrices figurines on your desk with a rather creepy smile. "A threat is a threat, be it declared via a twitch or at a fancy press conference with all the bells and whistles. We must respond accordingly, by preemptively positioning battleships within bombardment range of their major cities. If they don't back down, we'll wipe them off the map! That'll teach them what a rain of fire looks like." @@HE@@ chuckles as @@HE@@ knocks over a miniature effigy of Supreme Leader Drake with a wyvern.

2. "Aren't we taking this woman's Twitcher rants a bit too seriously?" questions your Ambassador to Blackacre, without showing any effort to disguise @@HIS@@ boredom. "I mean, this gal basically twitches all the time about xenophobic conspiracy theories or rants about dissidents. You should not reinforce this nonsense by giving her the attention she craves.

3. "If you let her get away with this insult, our people will start to question your competence as a leader!" clamours @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Public Relations Adviser, as @@HE@@ scrolls down on @@HIS@@ phone to read Drake's vitriolic twitches. "What we should do is to set up an official Twitcher account for you. This way you can counter Drake's attacks with her own weapon. An eye for an eye.

A recent story in the @@CAPITAL@@ Herald showed that massive @@DEMONYM@@ demand for Maxtopian jumbo shrimp is driving environmentally damaging practices in Maxtopia, including the rapid clearing of mangrove forests for huge jumbo shrimp farms. In response, @@NAME@@'s biggest green lobbying group has launched a campaign demanding that the @@DEMONYM@@ government block unsustainable imports exemplified by the oversized Maxtopian seafood.

The Debate
1. "This is an outrage!" exclaims environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while hastily wiping something that looks suspiciously like cocktail sauce from @@HIS@@ mouth. "We'd never tolerate this sort of environmental degradation here; why would we enable it in other countries through trade? We must ban these delectable - er, detestable shrimp imports from Maxtopia, and make sure we are properly assessing the environmental impact of all goods imported into @@NAME@@."

2. "@@DEMONYNPLURAL@@ wouldn't have to import these things if more was produced at home," states @@NAME@@'s only organic jumbo shrimp farmer, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, holding what appears to be a scrawny-looking crayfish. "Cut a few environmental regulations here, throw a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ at businesses such as mine, and I could grow my little jumbo shrimp farm enormously while lowering the prices for consumers. It'll still be greener than those barbarians in Maxtopia and you'll be putting @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ back to work!"

3. "Why should we care what's happening all the way in Maxtopia?" asks one of your aides, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while sunning @@HIM@@self on your office's balcony and eating a shrimp platter. "We can't solve all the world's problems, so let's focus on what matters: keeping @@NAME@@ beautiful.

It is predicted that serious damage to the economy may be imminent, with particular emphasis laid on the loss of trade in agricultural produce between @@NAME@@ and these countries.

The Debate
*1. "This is an outrage!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Megafruit Imports, kicking over a crate of unexported and slightly rotten-looking @@DEMONYM@@ kumquats in rage. "So what if @@NAME@@ might have stepped on a few toes here and there? All we're guilty of is being a strong and proud nation.

"These profiteering swine will do anything to undermine our glorious nation, but they are nothing more than paper tigers. I say we place agents and supply arms to instigate socialist revolution in these nations.

3. "Are we really going to risk starting war over this?" quails @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your Minister of Dairies, shaking in fear behind @@HIS@@ pineapple milkshake. "Even if we win, the problem isn't just that these nations are not trading with us, it's that our agricultural economy isn't self-sufficient. With some significant investments from the government and a ban on all imports, I'm sure we can achieve food security and a state of absolute economic independence from foreign trade."

4. "Plenty more fish in the sea," shrugs your Minister for Trade, looking remarkably calm about the entire situation. "There's plenty of smuggl... er, [i]enterprising traders[/i] in these nations perfectly willing to facilitate trade between ourselves and the nations in this so-called 'Coalition'. Sure, it's a bit on the dodgy side legally speaking, but I'm sure we'll muddle through somehow!"

5. "Maybe we should listen to this coalition's entirely reasonable demands, and scale back our weapons programs," muses your Foreign Minister, munching on a Maxtopian mango. "It's not like we really need that many smallpox-infused nuclear warheads, is it? Then, legume trade can proceed."

After @@NAME@@'s Forestry Department started its controversial program of controlled fire - intentionally setting parts of forests aflame to remove fuel for larger wildfires - a fire started by the Forestry Department got a bit hotter than expected and sparked an evacuation of Northwest @@CAPITAL@@.

The Debate
1. "I just don't see why this is being debated with such intensity," yawns @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an official in the Forestry Department, while casually flipping open a lighter. "Controlled burns are a proven way to reduce the severity and expense of wildfires. Fire is an element of many forests in @@NAME@@; we're just making sure it doesn't get out of hand. I admit we didn't do so hot with that last fire, but we'll get better, I promise."

2. "You can't keep doing this!" coughs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, asthmatic alderman representing Northwest @@CAPITAL@@, while eyeing an unlit candle on your desk nervously. "The smoke from these 'controlled fires' is putting out tons of air pollution and inflaming my lungs. Besides, those bumbling amateurs in red almost 'control burnt' half my district down!

I have chainsaws galore available at low, low prices. Just hire a bunch more forest rangers to go out there with chainsaws.

Following her admittance one week ago, @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAMEFEMALE@@ McCormack was arrested at @@ANIMAL@@ General Hospital this morning, charged with attempting to procure her own abortion. Crowds have been clamouring for her immediate release and others – including the would-be father, calling from the cell her testimony put him in – are demanding she be punished with maximum vigour.

The Debate
1. "How could she do this?" sighs Lila Tann, who runs both the Pregnancy Advisory Service and the Bouncing Bambinos Adoption Agency. "Of course, Miss McCormack had a trauma, but why compound that with another? Baby-murder kills the child's body, but it shatters the woman's mind. She can never get over it. Besides, there's always adoption: the safe and pain-free way to give innocent children a chance. You must maintain the abortion ban, in all cases, and support our extensive pro-adoption campaign. It's just forty weeks of their lives. What could possibly go wrong?"

2. "I can certainly see why Miss McCormack would feel like drastic measures were her only option," notes self-professed moderate pro-life advocate, Jedson Dumphy. "Fortunately, I have a solution that can't fail to please all y'all folks. We'll permit it, only for very specific exceptions: for victims of legitimate, proven non-consensual sex or when the host-mother will certainly die without treatment, up to a nine-week gestation period, and with permission of the baby's father."

3. "These people are deluded," a shadowy figure stands in the corner, their gravelly voice indistinguishable as male or female. "Do you want blood on your hands and deaths on your conscience? There could be treatable second-trimester complications and botched back-alley abortions that would have been completed safely in a proper hospital. Women seeking abortion are desperate. They'll try anything, regardless of any restrictions you can pull out of your a... administration. Bring universally available, medical abortion back to @@NAME@@."

*4. "We must pursue righteousness with yet more rigour," intones softly-spoken religious leader, @@RANDOM_NAMEMALE@@, his black cloak swishing around him. "I constantly hear of 'miscarriages'. Do you know their real name: spontaneous abortion! An abortion, yet there is no punishment. To call them 'miscarriages' perverts the Law that the female can only be saved through childbearing.

 Entertainment tycoon and billionaire Walter Eisner has proposed Eisnerland, a massive theme park that he wants to build in an economically impoverished area of northwestern @@NAME@@. Due to the significant expense of this project, Mr. Eisner is asking for state funds to help finance it.

1. "Eisner Enterprises has provided a great source of joy and family entertainment ever since our first animated motion picture, [i]Robbie the Rambunctious @@ANIMAL@@[/i], delighted our audiences," says Mr. Eisner as he skips around your desk in a business suit and 'Robbie Ears.' "My wonderland of whimsy will increase economic growth in @@NAME@@, and has a chance to become the number one tourist destination in all of @@REGION@@! Of course, we will have to move a few thousand residents out of the way, but we'll be providing much-needed employment for the area. Now would you like to see my plans for the Experimental Prototype Community Recreation Area Project?"

2. "This is an insane proposition," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, bursting in with a homemade picket sign that depicts Robbie sitting on a throne of cash. "These corporate monsters are trying to evict us from our homes in order to build this megalopolis of rickety rides and greasy, overpriced corn dogs. For the well-being of our families and communities, and the reputation of our nation, please refuse to provide funds for Eisnerland and ban all new corporate projects in residential areas."

3. "No one thinks about the alternative possibilities for these dilemmas," remarks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Secretary of Compromises and Other Weird Solutions, who appears to be wearing a different-colored sock on each foot. "You see, the obvious answer is to move the entire project out to the desert. There are no residential areas or regulations to worry about! Sure, many people would be exhausted moving around in the scorching heat, and there aren't any nearby restaurants, hospitals, or hotels, but perhaps the government could help pay for some of those as well."

4. "You can't put a big amusement park there!" shouts artist Harry Jarvey, who is infamous for burning all of his sculptures within a week of their completion. "That desert is the site of our annual arts and radical inclusivity festival. The whole thing is based on freedom of expression and participation, not the sale of pre-packaged commercialism. To turn our cherished playa into a morass of corporate commodification would be an outrage! I insist that you prevent this Eisner fellow from leaving any trace of his vanity project in our desert - or anywhere else - and maybe have the government subsidize our event, for good measure. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to write a few more rules for next year's festival."

Through a complex and unorthodox set of theological deductions, respected community faith leader @@RANDOM_NAMEMALE@@ decided that the local cryonics facility was a work of intrinsic evil. Late one night, he broke in and took a sledge hammer to ten cryogenically frozen brains. He didn't try to evade or resist arrest, and is now honestly surprised people think he has done anything wrong. The question is, what exactly is his crime?

The Debate
1. "Those who had their brains frozen were working on the assumption that they might one day in the future be resurrected, something which experts say is a virtual statistical certainty, given enough time," explains cryonics facility director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose ruthless business dealings have earned @@HIM@@ the nickname 'Captain Cold'. "Now, they've been denied that. That makes this crime ten counts of murder. Hopefully, nice strict sentencing here will teach people not to mess with our corporate holdings in the future." 

2. "Whoa, whoa! Playing piñata with some dead frozen brain popsicles is not the same as spilling the sloppy red stuff of a living person!" asserts tactless journalist Elsa @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "I'm not saying we should just let it go, but this wasn't murder. It was a crime of forced entry, damage to corporate property and desecration of human remains. Perhaps we should exercise some leniency seeing how this was, in fact, a political protest."

3. "Actually... there may have been a solid basis for what this protester was saying," ponders theologian Jadis Queen, poring over some apocryphal texts of her faith. "To be on the safe side, we should shut down all cryonics facilities. After all, our immortal souls may be at risk here."

4. "Not sure if this is a criminal matter or just some religious lunatic with a hammer," comments pizza delivery boy @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAMEMALE@@ Fry, handing you your pizza. "The guy was clearly nuts either way. Sounds to me like a mental health problem. He needs a psychiatrist, not a prison cell."

The Debate
1. "My feet are killing me," bemoans Gertrude, "and it's all the fault of a ridiculous dress code forced on me by my employers. I've been crippled by my work, and now I'm stuck with pain and loss of mobility. The government should ban employers from making particular clothes a condition of work. It's frankly sexist when us women are forced to wear high-heeled shoes! If I can save just one person from experiencing the torture I'm suffering now, then it will have been worth the effort of walking here today."

2. "What's wrong with wanting staff to look professional?" queries @@RANDOM_NAMEMALE@@, staff manager at the renowned Iddiott-Hellton Hotel. "We just want our employees to look respectable while they're dealing with clients. Nobody forced this old girl to take this job! Look, @@LEADER@@, if you really want to help, maybe you could set an example by seeing to your own attire. Honestly, everything you are wearing could use a hot iron and some starch."

Investigators have noted that the accident occurred the morning after daylight saving time went into effect, and concluded that it was likely due to conductor fatigue from the time change. You've shifted your schedule by an hour to discuss the matter.

The Debate
1. "It's high time we made a change," declares somnologist Dr. Van Winkle, pouring @@HIMSELF@@ a second cup of coffee. "The fact is, our work days are no longer slaves to the sun and moon, and so our body clocks shouldn't be either.

2. "Once again, our ancestors were ahead of their time," proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a patchouli-scented, bushy-bearded historian. "The future of @@NAME@@ is sundials, and they should be the only clocks our nation uses! We'll always be in harmony with the natural beat of the sun and our inherent sleep rhythms, no matter what our specific space-time location is. Yes, slight differences in each city's clocks might make train timetables and computers and such trivialities a little bit useless, but isn't synchronicity with the universe more important than an artificial obsession with seconds and minutes?"

3. "No! Not the railways!" gasps your Minister of the Environment and amateur ferroequinologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is currently wearing a worn-out conductor's hat.

"This might look like a 30-second commercial, but children often spend a whole day at the studio to complete the shots. Movies take months of long, gruelling days! If these kids were working in a sweatshop, everyone would be infuriated. Child labour doesn't stop being abuse when children work in a film set. You should ban kids from acting immediately."

2. "Whoa! How are we supposed to film the third sequel to [i]How To Train Your Unicorn[/i] without rug rat... valued child actors?" yells film director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, flanked by a small girl wearing a princess gown. "If anything, we should relax our overprotective labour laws, encouraging movies - all our vital industries - to utilise [i]more[/i] kids.

"Let's admit: commercials and movies do need child actors. But we must make sure they're not exploited, by limiting the working hours. If we just allow child actors to work for no more than one hour per day, nobody can say that is child abuse."

The Issue
When your Minister for Health fell asleep for the third time in your Cabinet meeting, you confronted @@HIM@@. @@HE@@ told you @@HIS@@ doctor had diagnosed @@HIM@@ with vitamin D deficiency. In fact, @@HIS@@ department estimates this condition may be affecting almost half of all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@.

The Debate
1. "It's because @@NAME@@ is such a gloomy place," @@HE@@ yawns, yanking apart the curtains of the conference room to let a feeble ray of sun shine in. "Look, I know we can't change the weather, but perhaps we can help people get more sunlight by promoting an outdoor culture. Why should we be cooped up in enclosed spaces like offices and schools? Give a tax break for businesses that have their workers under an open sky!"

[2]. "If you go out in @@NAME@@, you're likely to die of exposure," snarls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the owner of a local tanning salon, handing you a brochure with pictures of perfectly tanned top models. "If you subsidised sunbed services, people could enjoy the benefits of wholesome Sunny Day Natural Health Rays (tm), even when it is raining outside." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3. "All this natural sunlight seems to be a bit complicated," says synthetic chemistry enthusiast @@RANDOM_NAME@@, happily munching on @@HIS@@ morning toast enhanced with a colloid of crunch-enhancing plastic beads. "I mean, everyone loves chemistry. Require fortification of bread products, breakfast cereals and other foods with pre-isomerised 7-dehydrocholesterol, and then everyone will have healthy bones and teeth." @@HE@@ stops talking to spit out a broken tooth.

4. "Nothing new under the sun, huh?" butts in @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your elderly neighbour, slipping out of @@HIS@@ bathrobe to proudly expose sagging skinfolds and liver-spotted buttocks. "There's plenty of sunlight outside if you ask me. The problem is that light can't get through the fabric barriers that we mummify ourselves with! Enforce compulsory nudity, and let bodies luxuriate in the sun! For health!" @@HE@@ leers hopefully at an attractive young intern, miming the removal of clothing.

The Issue
Tonight's big family dinner seemed like such a nice idea. Alas, it's all descended into awkward silences and short tempers again. This is mostly thanks to your sister's complaints about the high price of feminine sanitary products, which she largely attributes to the so-called "tampon tax": a sales tariff on these items.

The Debate
1. "It's a bloody outrage! The patriarchy seems to believe that tampons and pads aren't essentials," rails your sister @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@, waving a grocery receipt under your nose. "You have to stop taxing feminine products! If the income stream is so important to you, stick it on income tax instead! Women everywhere are demanding change. Can't you go with the flow?"

2. "Don't make a scene, dear," soothes your mother, patting her on the shoulder. "If the prices are bleeding you dry or cramping your style, I'm sure your dear sibling will have the state buy them for you, and for all @@NAME@@'s ladies. That's what government is for, isn't it darling?"

3. "Ugh, I can't believe that your sister would even talk about such things at the dinner table," moans Uncle @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, handing out copies of his self-published pamphlet, [i]Women: For Pity's Sake, Don't Talk[/i]. "It completely put me off my borscht. If it were up to me, I'd make it a crime to publicly discuss women's monthly troubles. Some things are best kept private, period!"

4. "Let's try and be balanced here," whispers your Treasury Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wishing @@HE@@'d never accepted the invitation to your family home. "Sales tax is vital to help keep the burden of income tax down, but it's a good thing to be equitable. Why not add sales tax to men's daily goods like razors and shaving cream? That way, everybody pays their fair share."

A school in @@NAME@@ recently made headlines for farming crickets, mealworms and other invertebrates for consumption in the cafeteria. As the surprisingly professional and detailed science project write-up cited relatively low levels of greenhouse gas production involved compared to traditional pastoral farming, environmental activists are agitating the national government for action.

The Debate
*1. "You know, if you all were a little more open-minded to chomping down on critters, we'd be better off. Once you get over the fear factor you'll start pounding these babies down your esophagus by the handful," says Can You Eat It? contestant and professional snowboarder @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "They're super efficient at converting plant feed to protein and, like, way better for the environment! We should stick some funds into farming and slap some regulations on Big Cow and Big Chicken!"

*2. "Listen here!" starts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, National Director of Agriculture and Farming, tapping menacingly at a dreary flip-chart. "Our department has been trying to balance the demand for high-protein foodstuffs for an ever-growing population with the resources we have at hand. Farming the humble invertebrate takes up far less space than conventional meat farming, and they quite literally eat rubbish! Some people might make a meal out of eating mealworm pasta, but I'm sure they'll swallow it if we tell them it's for the greater good." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

3. "Insects? On my dinner plate?" squirms health inspector @@RANDOM_NAME@@, consulting a thick tome. "Well, there isn't any legislation as such that bans the eating of insects, but if we're going to start farming these critters then we're going to do it by the book. It has to be humane and hygienic, with proper documentation of all livestock, a chain of providence from field to slaughterhouse for each individual, and mandated minimum living space."

4. "Are you kiddin' me? I'd rather eat cow dung than pop one of 'em nasty crickers in my mouth," worriedly proclaims foodstuff trucker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I'll stick to eatin' thick, juicy...stea..." @@HE@@ trails off at the sight of a roadside cafe. "Anyway, in this country we don't eat that trash - we have standards.

"Vermin are forbidden by our holy verses for mortal consumption as they are agents of pestilence and disease.

*6. "Am I the only one in the room who actually read the study?" butts in militant vegetarian @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It says that farming these insects is better for the environment than raising animals for meat. News flash--it's still bad for the environment!

The Issue
Your cousin arrived at your office this afternoon, out of breath and deeply frustrated at having to spend day after day filling out forms, only to wait for six hours in a queue to register for another appointment to receive @@HIS@@ 27B/6 form to finalize @@HIS@@ registration and legally drive the sweet new ride @@HE@@ bought six weeks ago. You've agreed, after some persuasion, to hold a meeting with your Minister of Transportation and other experts to look into streamlining the process.

The Debate
1. "It's very important that we get all this information from drivers," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Transportation. "We have to make absolutely sure that our roads are safe, that all drivers are properly licensed, and that cars reported stolen are easily identified. If that means a bit of extra paperwork, so be it. Increase our budget for staff and we'll be able to expedite the registration process."

*2. "I have a radical idea," announces @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of @@NAME@@'s largest automobile manufacturer. "Simply license car dealerships to handle these processes for consumers! We can fill out all the necessary insurance paperwork for car owners, and even issue driving permits! The DMV is only slow because it has no competition.

4. "Licenses? We don't need no stinkin' licenses!" exclaims a scruffy-looking man who took a wrong turn and wandered into your meeting. "Why should the government have any say in who can and can't drive? Get rid of permits, licenses, traffic cops, borders, barriers, speed limits, road laws, and identification plates, and just let people live their lives!"

In a highly-anticipated boxing match between 'Pretty Boy' @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ and @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ 'The Junkyard Dog' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ watched by millions across the nation, both competitors walked away with more than one hundred million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. Critics are claiming that the fight has ushered in a new wave of spoilt, egotistical, money-grabbing athletes.

The Debate
1. "It is utterly ridiculous," tuts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a freelance journalist who formerly focused on politics but is rumored to have switched to reporting on sports to pay the bills. "If I knew dancing around like a fairy for an hour could earn me that much, I certainly wouldn't be wasting my time writing! The government should peg athletes' salaries to another hardworking profession, like freelance journalism, to curb this unfair advantage."

2. "That just doesn't cut it," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of a wage equality group. "What about the actor getting paid a princely sum for spending a day acting in a commercial? Or a CEO getting paid fifty times what their workers make to lounge on the golf course? The government should regulate all professions.

[b][anchor=828]#828[/anchor]: Your Execution In 30 Years Or Less Or You're Free [Saithal; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Thirty years ago, serial killer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ was sentenced to death, and has been on death row ever since due to constant appeals and backlogs. @@HE@@ was found dead of natural causes in @@HIS@@ cell this morning, prompting concerned lawyers, law and order advocates, and everyone else with an opinion to protest the monumental gaps between verdicts and execution.

The Debate
1. "Do you realize how much of our budget is being spent on housing these criminals?" cries government auditor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ dots an I and crosses Ts on the latest government expense report. "I understand death row is needed as an ultimate punishment for those who deserve it, but we can't keep spending truckloads of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ keeping these people for years or even decades on end! We need to set a maximum number of years before the sentencing and execution. Have some mercy on our budget!"

2. "It doesn't have to take as long as it does," proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a newly-appointed prosecutor. "If someone tries to make an appeal for 'jury misconduct' or 'having an impaired lawyer', that can delay the process exponentially. If we remove the ability for inmates on death row to appeal, I am positive you'll see a large decrease in spending on death row and faster trials overall."

3. "Time limits? Preventing appeals?" gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a simple country criminal defense lawyer from Southern @@NAME@@. "Inmates are still people! Long waiting times are the price we pay for making sure everyone @@NAME@@ executes is absolutely guilty. Violet help us if we execute an innocent person! Years of [i]habeas corpus[/i] proceedings and a large backlog are a small price to pay to ensure justice is truly served. In fact, we need to make it easier for convicted felons to appeal their often harsh sentencing."

4. "Clearly, the easiest solution is to execute people once they receive a guilty verdict!" chimes in horror movie aficionado @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Going to the courtroom would be so much more fun if you got to watch people die! Don't tell me you wouldn't go see a trial if that was the case. Oh, and it would probably save money or something."

5. "Or we could just abolish capital punishment," interjects your teenage niece as she takes a break from protesting other perceived injustices in @@NAME@@. "You want to save money on killing people? Just stop killing people. Appeals are quite expensive, you know."

The Issue
In an ongoing war that @@NAME@@ is embroiled in, your navy managed to capture something interesting: a huge but ageing battleship. You are now the arbiter of her fate.

The Debate
1. "She's not likely to be a very useful military asset in this day and age," explains shipyard director @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while putting some blue papers on your desk. "After all, she was pretty easily captured by our navy. But look at what she's made of - seventy thousand tons of steel! Think how many cars you could make with that. Help us build ship-breaking yards on the shoreline of @@NAME@@, and it'll boost the coastal economy forever."

2. Admiral @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, who coordinated the capture, has a different point of view. "Our navy has been sorely underfunded for years; this ship could be part of the boost we need. Back in the age of sail, navy captains who brought home prizes like this were rewarded and thereby encouraged to keep bringing home more prizes. Those ships would then be crewed, and made our fleet stronger! I think we should bring that system back in place so that our courageous sailors can expand our forces and prove themselves."

3. "Corals grow very well on iron," comments environmentalist and hippie @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dumping @@HIS@@ banjo and flowers for the occasion. "If we clean off all those horrible chemicals and oil residue, scupper it a few hundred metres off the coast, and divert shipping routes around its resting place, then we'll have a nice, bustling reef within a few years! It really would be a poetic end for a weapon of war to become a bedrock of life."

4. "This old girl may not be battleworthy, but she's still a piece of naval history," gushes navy recruiter @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "As a museum ship in harbour, this awe-inspiring battleship will amaze folk from far and wide. It will remind us of our history as a proud military power, show people how outmatched our foolish enemies were, and encourage young people to feel the patriotic call of duty."

[b][anchor=830]#830[/anchor]: Unreasonable Adjustments? [Dragude Sultanate; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
It's exam season, and the latest headlines report that a student registered as having dyslexia and dyscalculia received various adjustments due to @@HIS@@ disabilities. These included extra exam time, a scribe and a separate examination room. With the mounting cost of these adjustments and their perceived unfairness, interested parties have arrived at a public inquiry into the matter.

The Debate
1. "This kind of hand-holding is exactly what is making the next generation so stupid!" exclaims self-taught marine biologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I had to work hard to learn my trade without help from anyone. I kept on and persevered, much as the fearsome dolphin who knows that to stop swimming means death. Now they'll practically do the test for you as long as you have a doctor's note. I say we get rid of all this babying of our children and bring back survival of the fittest." Looking down at @@HIS@@ rotund frame, @@HE@@ quickly adds "or rather, survival of the smartest."

2. "That's absolutely absurd!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, parent of three autistic students. "Look at these test scores! Students with learning differences are still falling behind their peers even with these extra adjustments in exams. What we need to do is totally re-shape our entire education system from the ground up to make it more accommodating for everyone.

"Just send all of those... special children of yours to us and we'll set them up with workplace learning schemes in light manufacturing. It'll be a great way to build character, cut down on wage costs and teach the value of hard work! It's a win for the industry and the kids!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "Comrade, the revolution demands that each contribute according to their ability," intones @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Party Undersecretary and part-time stamp collector. "If these children cannot demonstrate the abilities needed for rigorous academic study at the age of, say, ten or so then perhaps they would be better off preparing for a future in less mentally demanding roles on assembly lines or in the mines.

A recent opinion survey carried out by the [i]@@LEADER@@ Fan Club[/i] has suggested that you are the most beloved and accomplished head of state in the history of @@NAME@@. They're suggesting that to celebrate this good news, a brand new public holiday would put the hoi polloi in even greater admiration of your glorious leadership.

The Debate
1. "Patriots Day!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an excitable junior civil servant who carries a picture of you in @@HIS@@ wallet, and is always trying to get you to notice @@HIS@@. "The national anthem would be played all day long on TV and radio. There'd be carnivals in the streets showcasing our traditional clothes, dance, music and food. It will be fun for the kids too, as they can decorate their bicycles in the national colours of @@NAME@@ and win prizes for the best decorations. And looking over the festivities, a sixty-foot tall portrait of you, our most beloved leader!"

2. "A celebration isn't a bad idea, but you're looking at it from the wrong perspective," offers Army General and author of the book [i]Why Leader Is Our Greatest Strategic Asset[/i], @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "An Armed Forces Day is what we need. Can you picture it now? A million armed men and women marching in perfect unison through the streets of @@CAPITAL@@, eyes right as they turn heads to salute you. Then, battalions of our newest armoured vehicles, followed by the best part: our biggest missiles on trailers. What a sight to behold! And all the civilians can be forced to be spectators; they wouldn't dare oppose that considering all the guns on show!"

[3]. "Public holidays have traditionally been of a religious nature," intones @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of @@CAPITAL@@. "Why don't we celebrate the holy moment of the creation of the world? Regardless of our faith, we can all agree that it is irrefutable that the hand of the divine was what set the universe in motion. Universe Creation Day is the holiday @@NAME@@ needs." [[color=blue]Religion is legal[/color]]

[4]. "Naked Truth Day!" yells the next speaker, who struts into your office totally naked, and stands directly in front of you without shame. Luckily, there is a framed photo of your parents on your desk that is located perfectly to avoid any offending sight. "We need a day when every citizen can be as free as Mother Nature intended. A day when you, @@LEADER@@, stand before us as if to say 'I have nothing to hide' and where we bask in joined consensual nakedness. It'll be a great chance to educate everyone on the benefits of nudism. Even prudes will come round to the idea, eventually." [[color=blue]Nudism is legal but not enforced[/color]]

5. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the top undertaker in @@NAME@@, has the final say. "I haven't had a day off for twenty-five years.

The Issue
Whistleblowers are claiming that internet video sharing website WhoTube has been censoring content distributed through their services that doesn't agree with the companies' political views.

The Debate
1. "This is blatant censorship!" exclaims Melania Kumar, known on WhoTube as [i]2Many_Big_Nosed_Bigtopians[/i]. "All I did was post a few videos explaining why I respectfully disagree with the political opinions of others, but out of the blue I was informed that I broke the terms of service and my channel was taken down. This abuse of censorship is killing free speech in this country."

2. "On the contrary, it's our right as a private enterprise to moderate our commercial property in whatever way we choose," claims Tarquin Rubin, a spokesperson for WhoTube. "Our terms of service state that we have a zero-tolerance policy for hate speech, and unfortunately for her, our moderators felt she violated that policy. Freedom of speech is about protection from government censorship and has nothing to do with how companies and people manage their private domains. The fact is, we have to look out for the interests of our advertising partners, if they pull their ads from our site we'll be hosed."

3. "WhoTube has the right idea banning hate speech," pipes-up Barack Adams, an activist for '@@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ Against Hatred'. "However, we must enforce that value on all levels of society. No more will we be stuck in the dark ages of intolerance and xenophobia, but instead we'll be working towards a new utopia for all people of every race, religion, identity, and background!"

4. "The problem is WhoTube has a virtual monopoly on online video sharing," moans your Minister of Public Endeavors Felicity Fox, while simultaneously rapidly typing on her laptop. "With competition, there could be ConservativeTube, LiberalTube, whatever. Everyone will be happy in their little echo-chambers. So just encourage new startups and enforce anti-monopoly measures against WhoTube. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a cat video that I need to finish editing."

After encouraging your cabinet to be on social media, Twitcher use has exploded. In a recent controversial Twit, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Finance Minister, posted that "Eckie-Ecola soda tastes like parrot urine." Since then, sales of Eckie-Ecola have gone flat and their stock prices have fizzled. The company is demanding an apology, and some on your staff are questioning the wisdom of all the social media usage.

The Debate
1. "Millions in profits lost!" moans Eckie-Ecola CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while opening a can of soda and 'accidentally' spraying fizz on your favorite portrait of yourself. "Thanks to your Finance Minister's careless and totally wrong Twit, I've had to lay-off hundreds of workers. I demand an apology, on Twitcher, and compensation for my losses! In fact, I'll go one step further and request that all politicians refrain from making these kinds of remarks on social media. Surely you people have more important things to do, like, I don't know, running the nation?"

2. "I hate to admit it, Leader, but, uh... the CEO does have a bit of a p... point," mumbles your junior aide @@RANDOM_NAME@@, nervously clutching a short straw. "You and the Cabinet, uh... maybe DO spend a tiny bit too much time on social media. While the Twits are, of course, hysterical and incredibly informative, they might be a tiny bit of a distraction.

3. "Now hold on there!" defensively interrupts @@NAMEfromDescription@@, while simultaneously posting about the 'nasty' WhoTube comments section in @@HIS@@ latest Twit. "Social media is great for politicians! It helps us connect with the electorate in a way our parents and grandparents never thought possible! Yes, some of us can get a little... irresponsible, but what about our freedom of speech, huh? Doesn't that apply to us as well?"

4. "You know, this whole social media thing has got me thinking," replies your Propaganda Minister, grinning from ear to ear. "You have hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitcher and MyFace, right? What if we used that to our advantage? Why not attack government critics more directly?

Earlier this week, several people were sickened by carbon monoxide poisoning while waiting in a long line at a government office in downtown @@CAPITAL@@. Fortunately, nobody was killed, but the incident has prompted calls for the government to install carbon monoxide detectors in its buildings and better regulate safety standards.

The Debate
1. "The government should be thanking its lucky stars that there were no permanent injuries," notes government lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, relieved that nobody has decided to sue yet. "In order to abate public outcry, we need to make sure this doesn't happen again. We must install carbon monoxide detectors in every single government building in @@NAME@@, and provide government employees with the proper safety training. It may be a bit of an expense, but surely that beats a class action lawsuit, yes?"

2. "Why stop at government buildings? These detectors should be installed everywhere!" enthuses your worrywort Public Safety Minister, after checking the various detectors in your office. "We need to install these detectors in schools, places of business, and even people's homes. Carbon monoxide is a threat that needs to be taken seriously. Some people may not like this being mandatory, but safety knows no price tag. After all, people spend hundreds of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ on home security systems. The only thing that's different is that we're offering this free of charge."

3. "Oh, I'm sure this time the government will be able to fix another problem it created," sneers anti-government conspiracy theorist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, setting off your sarcasm detector. "The last thing we need is the government going into people's homes and installing these things. For all we know you're planting listening devices in them! If the people want these detectors, they'll go out and buy them themselves. This is just government finding excuses to feed their own bloated bureaucracy. How about the government sticks its big nose out of things for once?"

4. "Sounds like the problem is the buildings, not some gas," chimes in contractor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Have you seen the state of some of these buildings? The Public Affairs building is older than you are! We need to tear down these decrepit monstrosities and replace them with new technological marvels that can eliminate poisonous gasses before they're a threat! Will it be expensive and inconvenient?

While most executions tend to have a few people in the viewing gallery, the notoriety of the infamous ingester of infants has demand for ringside seats at an all-time high.

The Debate
1. "I guess I wanna see with my own eyes that she's definitely dead and gone," explains mum-of-three @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, filling a carton with toffee-flavoured popcorn. "Also, it'd be so cool to tell the other school-mums that we saw the Cannibal die, they'll be totes jealous. My youngest has a day off nursery especially for this.

2. "A baying crowd would lack a certain decorum," observes professional executioner @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Instead, why not have the execution broadcast live on television?

"If the government had monitored this 'Citizens' Chapel Cultivation Concept', they'd have seen the lethal drug stockpile and my son would still be alive! The government must focus on defending its citizenry from wacko cults such as the Citizens' Chapel, even if it means state surveillance of every religious group in @@NAME@@!"

*2. "Heresy!" bellows @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Under-Poobah of the Order of Violet, donning a phlox purple top hat. "We cannot have unbelievers profaning our sacred spaces with their very presence. Sure, some wacky groups cite religion to commit atrocities, but those are the minority of religious sects! I demand - for all religious groups - absolute privacy from government encroachment!" [[color=blue]Violetism is legal[/color]]

*3. "Heresy! Or, you know, just plain unfair," gripes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the leader of the Tranquility of Yellow, donning a mellow yellow top hat. "We cannot have unbelievers profaning our sacred spaces with their very presence. It's not nice. Sure, some wacky groups cite religion to commit atrocities, but those are the minority of religious sects! I demand - for all religious groups - absolute privacy from government encroachment!" [[color=red]Violetism is illegal[/color]]

4. "You could have prevented this," announces journalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, scattering article drafts onto your desk. "I'd investigated the Citizens' Chapel for months. I had records of huge drug shipments, and sworn affidavits from former members testifying to @@lastnamefromoption1@@'s midnight muttering and purveying paranoia. I wrote to ask every department to stop the nutcase. But he kissed some junior ministers'... whatever, and nothing happened. To top it all, my stories were pulled - I was accused of persecuting him! If the government was expected to seriously investigate all concerns, those poor people might still be alive."

5. "We all know the real problem, and it won't be solved by turning this nation into some kind of police state," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the ethereal sister to one of the deceased, who is sporting a T-shirt that reads [i]Hugs Not Drugs[/i]. "The real problem isn't that some people have a different belief. Hey, live and let live, right? But when this @@lastnamefromoption1@@ guy started preaching 'heroic self-immolation', you let him get hold of all kinds of bad stuff. Sleeping pills, pain pills, potassium cyanide... You know. Not cool. If you, like, stopped selling substances that can kill people, we can all just go and live in peace."

The Issue
Auditors from the World Assembly have decided to pay a visit to assess how much @@NAME@@ should pay to fulfill its annual donation to the organization. The problem? The law regulating the donations operates as if it isn't voluntary, and the number they're quoting is causing your accountants to faint.

The Debate
1. "I know the language of the resolution says 'donation', but it's a mandatory donation. Here, look at the third definition from the top," asserts your Chief Legal Advisor, shoving a dusty, leatherbound book under your nose. "And there's all the legislative history from the debates… what isn't censored out, at least. We have a legal and moral obligation to obey international law. Besides, the last thing we want is to be noncompliant with the World Assembly. The repercussions would be unthinkable."

2. "How could a 'donation' possibly be mandatory?" snorts your Minister of Finance. "Pseudo-legal claptrap, if you ask me. Now, we can't break the law, obviously, but look at how many zeros there are in that number. A lot, that's how many. The law clearly needs a little tweak. Let's have our World Assembly ambassador write up a quick repeal and replacement. The international community couldn't possibly be opposed to some common-sense reform, right?"

3. "I think I have a solution for you, @@LEADER@@," whispers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, President and CEO of the Agency for Creative Solutions. "These 'rules' about donations are really more like guidelines anyway. Look, if you change a few numbers in the books, they won't have anything to take. Here, we can just erase this zero… carry the seven… and now you're in the red! As long as no one looks too closely at the books, you probably won't suffer terrifying reprisals. In fact, we'll even do this one for free, if you make us your exclusive government accounting service." @@HE@@ smiles, showing far too many teeth. [???]

4. "Who gives an empty sack about 'international' law?" exclaims radical radio pundit @@RANDOMNAM@@, who just shouldered @@HIS@@ way into your office. "For too long the World Assembly and its bureaucratic gnomes have leeched off our glorious nation's hard work! They regulate our businesses into the ground with their child labor and environmental protection laws, involve themselves in our affairs with their feel-good anti-slavery legislation, and then they want us to empty the treasury into their bottomless bar tabs! Resign now and get rid of 'em all, I say!" @@HE@@ eyes up a nearby security guard's weapon. "By any means necessary." [???]

The Issue
The beloved comic book series [i]Dogman[/i] is set to mark its eightieth anniversary this year. A coalition of comic book aficionados, young and old, have gathered outside your office to decide how to best celebrate this achievement.

The Debate
1. "You know what I loved?" reminisces ageing general @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The war arc! Ha ha! Great fun to see Dogman giving those blighters from Blackacre what-for! That's the kind of patriotic hero our country should be celebrating. Make Dogman a symbol of patriotism and @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ supremacy, an icon of our strength! Our enemies will learn to truly fear our bark and our bite."

2. "You know, Dogman stands for a lot more than just beating up bad guys," counters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a well-known environmentalist and peace activist. "He shows children how important it is to take care of nature, and how kindness is the greatest superpower of all. Dogman-themed recycling bins and a positive ad campaign could be a great hit and really send out the right message."

3. "Dogman is all very well, and a good role model for boys, but what about the girls?" asks renowned newspaper columnist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why don't we use this to celebrate some of the famous women in the comics? After all, Dogman's long-term love interest donned the mantle of Weasel Lady for four whole issues whilst Dogman was in hospital after his battle with Irritant Flower."

4. "Hah! That run of comics was so full of inconsistencies it would be funny if it weren't so tragic," sneers comic book enthusiast and self-proclaimed expert on Dogman, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Quite apart from anything else, The Bamboozler's machine was destroyed in issue 242, yet somehow he manages to bring it back to mortally wound Dogman in a later issue. And a normal human that is somehow able to don the sacred Weasel Lady mantle? Worst storyline ever! Let's at least make this celebration somewhat balanced. I have a long list here of the various inconsistencies in the series for your speech..."

5. "You know these comics are bull, right?" says Jamie Logan, former vigilante and one of six men who has fought crime on the streets under the mantle of Dogman in the past century. "Maybe a quarter of it happened, and not like this. In the real world, people die, and no dude in a leotard can stop that. Adults shouldn't read superhero comics. Force them to grow up, and drag them back to face reality." He stares moodily at the cloudy sky, waiting for the Dogsignal.

The Issue
After a recent incident where a lifeguard refused to save a drowning swimmer because she thought he looked like he belonged to another political party, talking heads on cable TV have seized upon the moment to ask if the current partisan political tensions in @@NAME@@ have gotten out of control.

The Debate
1. "Clearly the root of the problem is the media capitalizing on existing tensions for monetary gain," argues frequent cable TV pundit @@RANDOM_NAME@@, unfazed by the chagrined frown of the show's host. "We need to put rules in place so the media cannot be so blatantly partisan and negative in its reporting of political news stories..."

2. "That's precisely the sort of dangerous idiocy your party would advocate!" shouts host @@RANDOM_NAME@@, cutting off @@HISfromOption1@@ attempts to talk. "People just need a little incentive to break through their bubbles and see the other side as people too. Give a small tax break to people based on how many of their MyFace friends have different political views, and I'm sure all this partisan hullabaloo will be gone overnight."

[3]. As the program quickly cuts to an ad-break, a soothing, over-cheerful voice caresses your ears. "Looking for love, friendship, and happiness?" On screen, a cascade of fizzy Eckie-Ecola is poured into a glass, ice cubes clinking. "Pop the can, and feel all the love you can! Nothing brings you closer together than Eckie-Ecola." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color] AND [color=blue]Advertizing is legal[/color]]

4. "I don't see what the problem is," notes your aide, turning off your TV. "In fact, I say we enhance partisan identification by designating what colors people can wear based on their political affiliation. Then you'll immediately know who is working to better the country, and who only has morally bankrupt and wrongheaded ideas."

The Issue
Parents at West @@CAPITAL@@ High School were furious to discover that teachers belonging to a small evangelical sect ignored national guidelines about comprehensive sex education, instead teaching an abstinence-only programme.

The Debate
1. "How is Little @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ supposed to survive a world of adult pressures without knowing all the facts?" fumes parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@HIS straggly hair hanging limply around @@HIS@@ shoulders. "It's deplorable that so-called educators could leave @@HIM(child)@@ so unprepared for life. Order that all schools teach the standardised and comprehensive curriculum as written, and fire all teachers that refuse!"

2. "The walking mop is correct," attests Miss @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, one of the teachers in question, writing a red 'F' on your hand. "And we tell the youngsters exactly how it is. We show the crippling effects of syphilis; tell them every sexually-active person could have it. We tell them condoms cause rashes; that boys who kiss you will leave. We tell them that some women who have an abortion will never get pregnant again. And we say: only those who join our Purity Club, marrying their one pure and predestined partner can avoid those horrors. For facts, from a correct viewpoint, you must fund our abstinence-only curriculum nationwide."

3. "Immoral purveyors of the perverse!" booms Fly-fornication Yoder, a bushy-bearded member of an obscure order, who is trailed by his black-clad wife and twelve thematically-named children. "The youth hear filthy words – [i]endometrium, oestrogen, epidermis[/i] – and soon they are side-hugging, holding hands, and watching prime-time satire on the [i]Comedy Network[/i]. The One Above is clear: remain pure, knowing nought of the foulness by which infants are begotten until your wedding night. Ban all discussion of the mechanics of reproduction, for @@NAME@@'s moral health."

4. "We could make everyone happy," coos prematurely-grey former-teacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@HIS@@ bug-eyes seeming even larger through a thick pair of round-rimmed spectacles. "I admit, I used to be one of those hip 'withhold nothing' teachers. Then I had kids. The idea of my itty-bitty @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ hearing naughty words, in the name of 'education'? Not on my watch, bucko. Big Government should stop legislating every tiny detail of our kids' school day, and allow schools to teach any sex education curriculum they like: from no-holds-barred to nothing at all. Then parents will be free to choose the school that best suits their needs."

The Issue
Due to a recent spate of acid attacks in @@CAPITAL@@, many @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are calling upon you to face this growing problem.

The Debate
1. "You need to be exceptionally cruel to carry out these attacks," observes Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, in a cold tone of voice. "A little human empathy would prevent these horrific premeditated crimes, but the monsters who perpetrate these crimes are inherently selfish, and can only understand their own pain, not that of others. So the solution is simple - if someone is convicted of carrying out an acid attack, then before you send them to prison, apply acid to their faces. I think if these evil folk know that they'll be the ones feeling the burn, they'll think twice before acting."

2. "Take care of those already affected by acid attacks," demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an attack victim with a determined look in @@HIS@@ eyes. "Our faces have been marred for the rest of our lives. I've had to face countless operations, and I'm still recovering from the trauma. Some victims have been blinded, some find it hard to get a job because people find it hard to look at them. The government should make sure to fund the surgeries and therapies that an acid victim needs. Economic and social discrimination against victims should be banned. And attackers, they should get life sentences in prison, since that's what us victims experience."

3. "The solution is as plain as the nose on my face," proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a plumber speaking to a crowd of acid attack victims. "The chemicals used in these attacks are very easy to access and obtain. Drain cleaner is the most commonly used fluid in these crimes, and it can be bought cheaply at the nearest store. Outlaw the possession of corrosive substances for everyone except for licensed tradesmen. If people need their pipes unclogged, they must call a professional to handle the situation."

4. "Them harlots deserved it!" writes wanted criminal @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, in a childlike scrawl on bloodstained paper that arrived by old-fashioned post this morning. "Yes, I doused my daughter in acid, and I don't feel any remorse! Women have gotten too uppity, refusing the marriages we arrange for them, or cavorting in public with their naked arms and wanton smiles. Acid cleanses a woman of these wrongs, and reminds her daily of the consequences her unclean actions have wrought."

The Issue
Local chocolate factory Wenko's Candy Universe was busted by the police last night. Authorities discovered that it was only able to produce its tasty treats at low, low prices due to a workforce that was comprised of illegal immigrants from Zompaboodaland, a battle-ravaged country that has been mired in a decades-long civil war. The ill-treated workers had been smuggled into @@NAME@@ with the promise of work, and were being forced to "work off their cost of passage."

The Debate
1. A group of men each as tall as your knee stumble into the room and break into song. "Zoompo-boodo-zippity-zoo, master feeds us terrible food. Zoompo-boodo-zippa-dah-deeeeee, if you are bad he will whip ye! What do you get when you eat like a cat? An eating disorder, and that is that! I don't like the taste of it!" The Zompa Boodas hand you a petition asking for all illegal immigrants to be granted amnesty and citizenship, before they are shoveled into a wheelbarrow by your security guard, in order to remove them from your office.

2. "WHAAAAAT?" inquires madman factory owner, Willy Wenko. "These claims are preposterous! My little helpers have their own lives, families, and free will. Furthermore, I pay them plenty!" He turns to the last three little workers still in your office, handing two of them a piece of chocolate each, but grabbing the third around the throat. "So you thought it was a good idea to tell tales, huh? NO RATIONS FOR A WEEK! Ahaha, sorry, that was just a little joke... I beg you, allow me to keep our little factory family together, and let the magic of Wenko Chocolates keep bringing smiles to little children's faces! For the kids, @@LEADER@@, the kids!"

3. "Are you kidding me? This is a no-brainer!" exclaims Immigration Officer Charles Bucket, whose fearless infiltration of the factory was instrumental in busting open the Wenko case. "It is obvious this purple-hatted lunatic was exploiting these people! How would you like it if you were kidnapped by some rich weirdo to work in their factory forever? We need to ship these little folk home immediately!"

The Issue
A cancer patient has died after taking the advice of @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Night, an alternative therapist of dubious qualification. The patient rejected traditional medicine in favor of her 'secret cure', which was revealed to be healing crystals, giving up 'radiation-causing technology', and living on a diet of raw onions. Questions have been raised about whether restrictions should be put on alternative treatments.

The Debate
1. "Poppycock!" scoffs your physician, Doctor @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, raising @@HIS@@ eyebrow witheringly. "These so-called alternative therapies do nothing but destroy the integrity of real medicine, where trained doctors with real degrees – not this nutcase who bought her diploma from an alleyway in Maxtopia – use empirical evidence that's collected over decades. Stop this pillaging of science. Ban these literal snake oil salespeople from peddling false hope and telling the desperate and ill anything for a quick buck!"

2. "Lies and slander!" trills Ms. Night, as she uses a small model of a frowning-face cancer cell as a stress ball. "If this layman is finished, I can explain. All diseases are caused by stress and poor immunity. Even cancer. And all can be cured by removing the stress – those depressing outside influences, that job you never wanted, a nagging family member – and a diet high in immune-boosting antioxidants. Too much stress! That's all there is to it."

3. "The problem is not alternative therapy itself, but rather that it is being promoted as a cure for cancer," declares acupuncturist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while pulling needles out of one of your interns' back. "It is charlatanism on which we must clamp down, including glib peddlers of easy answers such as Ms. Night. The prestigious Medical Association of Brancaland uses acupuncture to relieve the side-effects caused by cancer and its treatments, such as pain and fatigue. We must allow alternative therapists, trained to nationally recognisable standards, to help patients where there is sound evidence that it works."

[b][anchor=844]#844[/anchor]: Essentially On Strike [Socialist Nordia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Disappointed with their current wages and working conditions, disgruntled law enforcement officers have voted for strike action, leaving no one to maintain order. A majority of police officers are now refusing to work until their demands are met, in turn stirring public debate over the ethics of striking by so-called essential workers.

The Debate
1. "My daily commute is being blocked by the same people who are supposed to be protecting us," complains Commodities Analyst @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Criminals are running wild! These officers are guilty of gross dereliction of duty, and should be ashamed of themselves. In fact, they should either get back to work, or be fired immediately. Essential workers have no business risking our lives for their own petty financial gain."

2. "You'd better believe we're upset," snaps Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, making no effort to pursue as a pickpocket runs off with your wallet. "We dedicate our lives to keeping the public safe, and must always be vigilant, yet we're paid ridiculously low wages and get about as much respect as the criminals we bring to justice. We have every right to be striking, just like workers in every other industry. Yes, of course, the country is suffering without our services. That's the point. That's why you should grant our requests."

3. "Everyone has a right to strike, but everyone also has a right to essential services," asserts idealistic student and socialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You just have to make sure that there's sufficient funding and training for redundancy to exist within the system, so that essential services can cover for each other at times of industrial action. If ambulance crews are on strike, use fire patrol vehicles and police convoys. If the firefighters are on strike, then deploy the army. If the army goes on strike... well, yeah, that's a toughie. But you get the idea."

The Issue
A controversial new 'biography' based on your personal life before your rise to power has proved to be quite popular all over @@NAME@@. While many are calling it comedic drivel, some are taking it quite seriously.

The Debate
1. "Everything in that book must be true," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the nation's leading distributor of tin foil hats. "Why else are you denying it so hard? Now we know about the covert and underhanded negotiations you held with Brancaladian gold-smugglers!" @@HE@@ frantically waves a copy of the book in your face. "Tell the truth, @@LEADER@@! You can't hide from it forever! Mandate that all politicians cannot tell a lie."

2. "Am I mistaken, or is the author of this book the legendary stand-up comic Jerry Carlin?" points out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an amateur comedian with a knack for impersonating you. "There is no legitimate reason for concern over a couple of silly jokes. You need to find a sense of humor before one more bad pun lands a comedian in trouble. Comedy is a form of art, not a nuisance to the credibility of politicians and leaders. The government should not have a say on how we tell our jokes."

3. "What poppycock!" blasts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your red-faced Press Secretary. "Gullible consumers, which we admittedly know is a large slice of the demographic pie, will eat that thing up and hang on every word!" @@HE@@ takes a breath to scoff and sputter unintelligibly at another passage from the book. "We can't provide a stage for these liars at the expense of your reputation. We must approve everything written about the government before it hits the bookshelves."

4. "Or we could just write your official autobiography," advises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your extremely persuasive Propaganda Minister. "It'll be easy to distribute it to the masses. They wouldn't doubt a single word. Only you should decide what you want the people to know about your life, not some hack comedian with an ax to grind."

The Issue
Shortly after your Finance Minister delivered a rousing speech to shore up support for your latest budget, it was discovered that the majority of the speech was plagiarized from a popular Brancalandian economist.

The Debate
1. "Schools have expelled students for plagiarism; the same rules should apply to the highest offices of the land," notes @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Language Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, looking over a transcript of your latest speech. "Plagiarism is essentially theft, and we ought to take a tougher stance. The Minister should be sacked! Besides, it hardly looks good on you when supposedly expert cabinet ministers are caught stealing content from a second-rate Brancalandian economist." @@HE@@ finishes reading your speech. "Hmm, this speech seems awfully familiar to the one that leader made in that alien invasion movie."

2. "So what if my speech was similar to what some hack economist wrote?" questions your Finance Minister, who hasn't been seen since the speech. "People enjoyed the speech, and support for the budget had gone up! Of course those polls were taken before this so-called scandal, but that's beside the point! People are making way too big a deal of this when there are way more important things for them to be worried about like, um, so how about them..." @@HE@@ trails off. "Let's just ride this out and people will forget about it. At least until the next scandal."

3. "And what kind of message does that send to children?" scolds your personal assistant while tsking the Finance Minister. "It seems to me that the problem is the lack of competent speechwriters. Why not invest in the administrative budget so we can hire some quality people? It may cost an extra @@CURRENCY@@ or two, but it's better than being embarrassed by discount writers who think that [i]Twilight[/i] is the height of literary genius."

4. "You could at least acknowledge me if you're going to use my work," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Brancalandian economist, after wandering away from a tour group. "Or better yet, you could pay me to use my work. Us economists aren't exactly rolling in the dough, you know!"

The Issue
@@CAPITAL@@ University researchers have reported that as many as 1 in 3 people in @@NAME@@ may be suffering from chronic loneliness. Studies say this is causing considerable harm to people's health, as dangerous as smoking a pack of cigarettes each day.

The Debate
1. "The problem here is social isolation," observes lead researcher Dr. Elena Rugby, who is plastered with a distracting amount of facial make-up. "Lonely people could just use some government-funded opportunities where they can meet up and chat, get-togethers where they might find the man of their dreams after being left at the altar thirty-two long years ago." She sighs wistfully and averts her gaze.

2. "No, the problem here is perceived social isolation, not actual isolation," interrupts co-researcher Mackenzie Thomas, talking to you via a carefully crafted sock puppet on his right hand. "Mr. Sock here thinks that it'd be better to provide counseling and drugs to brighten up life. You're only alone if you feel alone." He pecks Mr. Sock on the 'cheek' and smiles happily.

"No, no, the problem here is isolating perceptions of what constitutes socialisation," interjects IT support nerd Doreen Mode, showing a clueless researcher how to turn his computer off and on again. "Two words for you: robot companions. Okay, three words: foxy robot companions. Kit out social services with a few of these, and BAM... job done." [[color=blue]Must have computers[/color] AND [color=purple]Must not have high primitiveness[/color]]

4. "No, no, no! The problem here is that these socialists are attempting to isolate big government solutions," complains socialite Daisy Hawkins, smoothing out her second-hand green velvet jacket. "If you really want people to be less lonely, then cut back income tax a bit, and they'll have more disposable income to get out and meet people. More money equals more happiness!"

5. "No, no, no. And no. The problem here is social isolation being seen as undesirable," comments introvert Ringo Harrison, offering his thoughts softly from behind a pair of face-obscuring sunglasses. "Wouldn't the world be better if everyone just stopped all this inane chatter and got on with some quiet reading? Oh, there's an idea: maybe you could make two hours every evening into no-contact time, where people aren't allowed to talk or interact with each other. That'd be... nice."

It features a young girl ballet-dancing in a rose-pink bedroom, holding a baby-pink toy unicorn and a fluffy cameo-pink magic wand, while wearing matching cotton-candy pink dancing shoes, a tiara and flounced pink tutu.

The Debate
1.

"Don't you see that such stereotypes are harmful to everyone, that you're telling all girls that the only thing they're good for is being beautiful?

[b][anchor=850]#850[/anchor]: The Prints And The Slaughter [Singapore no2; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The nation was in shock today after a shooting left dozens dead in downtown @@CAPITAL@@. After the shooter was arrested, a search of @@HIS/HER@@ home revealed that the guns were manufactured by a 3D printer, thrusting the use of the devices into the limelight.

The Debate
1. "These newfangled printers are making it easy for crooks to get their hands on guns!" complains @@CAPITAL@@ Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@, showing you pictures of the armory the shooter had amassed. "I say we ban these dangerous machines, and give the police force a free hand to confiscate any device or materials that can be used to manufacture gun parts. We must reinforce our zero tolerance gun policy and remind our citizens that no guns keeps them safe."

2. "What's stopping citizens from getting the printers or guns on the black market?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former gun lobbyist who was injured in the attack. "Gun control is impossible with today's technology. If I still had my gun, I wouldn't have a bullet lodged in my shoulder blade. You should legalise guns and let us defend ourselves, and let us use printed guns if that's our preference."

3. "Legalising guns would be anarchy in the streets!" reminds the CEO of electronics giant Pear. "However, 3D printers are quite versatile and useful. I hear some countries are using 3D printers to manufacture artificial organs. Imagine how many lives that would save! All it would take is some generous government funding, and some police oversight, to make sure that this technology is used to help people, not to kill them."

[b][anchor=851]#851[/anchor]: Commercial Tidings Well In Advance [Solvada; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The holiday season is commonly regarded as a wonderful time of the year when families can get together, share in good times, and give each other plenty of gifts. Of course, this hasn't gone unnoticed by the corporate sector, as many big-name companies have chosen to begin advertising their holiday-related products many months in advance. This has left many citizens confused, frustrated, and in need of your guidance.

The Debate
1. "This is ludicrous!" shouts one unhappy young adult who somehow managed to stroll into your office, waving around a "New Year's Sale" advertisement that was issued in the month of September. "Why are they telling us about all these Violet-darned holidays so early? It's absolute madness. Pranksgiving hasn't even hit yet and they're talking about Life Day like it was tomorrow! This flagrant consumerism must be stopped. I demand that you make it so companies can only have holiday-relevant advertisements and decorations during the month of the respective holiday."

2. "Let's not get too hasty," states a portly, white-bearded gentleman in jolly attire who claims to be the CEO of a major toy company. "Sometimes people need to take a while to think over what kind of presents they should get for their loved ones. That's why we find it necessary to remind them so early that the holidays are approaching. We just want to give our customers enough time to decide what to buy. You know, maybe you could help by mentioning the upcoming festivities in your speeches. Ho ho ho!"

*3. "I agree that the government should stay out of this," states Lieutenant General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who dropped by your office to discuss border security. "However, there should be an exception for the holidays that are actually important, such as Military Heroes of the @@TYPE@@ Day. We must mandate that all businesses devote an equal amount of attention to patriotic celebrations as they do the other holidays, like the Feast of Saint Mauve that those Violetists are always going on about. Personally, I don't know why you'd want to celebrate a demented old lady who ate a dozen human hearts in a single day, but to each his own I suppose." [[color=blue]Violetism is legal[/color]]

*4. "I agree that the government should stay out of this," states Lieutenant General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who dropped by your office to discuss border security.

We must mandate that all businesses devote an equal amount of attention to patriotic celebrations as they do the other holidays, like the Feast of Saint Beryl that those Cult of Cyan weirdos are always going on about. Personally, I don't know why you'd want to celebrate a demented old lady who ate a dozen human hearts in a single day, but to each his own I suppose." [[color=red]Violetism is illegal[/color]]

5. "The capitalist pigs continue to show their true colors!" cries a woman wearing a hammer-and-sickle shirt and waving around a red flag. "All this blatant consumerism is brainwashing the workers into buying their horrible products months in advance. This is how they do business, by leeching off of the hard work of the laborers and pressuring them to buy, buy, buy all throughout the year, holiday or not. @@LEADER@@, you MUST ban all capitalism to ensure that these money-grubbers will be unable to prosper except by serving the masses!"

[6]. "The blasphemy on display here is completely atrocious!" announces popular televangelist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, adorned in sequined priestly attire. "Truly, these heathenish money-changers only see Maxxmas and the other holidays as a celebration of profits. Our people are forgetting the all-important meaning of this most sacred time of the year. Let us ensure that all commercials aired during the holiday season contain very strong and prominent reminders of our glorious faith. Oh, and of course it wouldn't hurt to include a special reminder about my own role in the Grand Design." [[color=purple]Must not have Atheism[/color]]

[b][anchor=852]#852[/anchor]: Brown Breeches Thanks To Speeches [Helaw; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
While attending a conference, you found yourself struggling to understand one of your ministers as @@HE@@ stuttered through @@HIS@@ speech on the importance of public speaking for politicians. You later encountered @@HIM@@ in a dark and slightly smelly side-corridor of the government halls, where @@HE@@ quietly informed you that @@HE@@ has glossophobia - a fear of giving speeches.

The Debate
1. "The correct response is obvious," tuts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a highly renowned speech therapist. "All members of the government - yes, even you, @@LEADER@@ - should be forced to take classes on public speaking to improve their speech skills and help them confront their fears. I'm certain the taxpayers will appreciate the classes if it ensures that their favourite politicians can finally speak with confidence about all the important things in life, like the appallingly low wages of speech therapists!"

*2. "Now, there isn't any need for wasting the government's time like that," boasts the eccentric CEO of SlangoTech, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Our company has been working hard to build a new piece of technology that can alleviate all of your problems. In simple terms, it is a highly-advanced device that reads out speeches for the speaker, in their voice! All they need to do is stand there and make some nondescript mouth movements, and they'll be absolutely fine. Now, about our payment plans..." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "There is an intelligent solution to this," posits a scientific adviser of yours, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "One of @@NAME@@'s top laboratories has been working hard to build a new piece of technology that can alleviate all of our problems. In simple terms, it is a highly-advanced device that reads out speeches for the speaker, in their voice! All they need to do is stand there and make some nondescript mouth movements, and they'll be absolutely fine. Now, about our funding..." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "Get this rabble out of the government!" exclaims resident office haranguer, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If someone cannot make a big, grand speech about their plans, then they absolutely cannot decide what is best for this nation. Show 'em the door, and slam it as soon as they're out - we won't even be able to hear the buggers stammer their complaints."

5. "I-if I could get a word in here," meekly whispers your glossophobic minister, visibly shaken by the prior outburst. "I d-don't think that it's a problem, at all. If anything, th-the quiet ones always come up with the best ideas, and maybe w-w-we can just hire someone else to say what we think. At least, I th-think so, I don't know..." @@HE@@ then slithers down in @@HIS@@ chair, disappearing from view.

[b][anchor=853]#853[/anchor]: Silence Is Golden [Siarki; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
During your trip to see the premiere of your sister's documentary on the Maxtopian Civil War, your viewing of the film was interrupted by glowing phone screens and obnoxious calls. As it turns out, other citizens often cite this as their biggest pet peeve.

The Debate
1. "Cinema is an art that requires the viewers' silence," begins pretentious movie critic @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ uses @@HIS@@ fingers to frame the composition of you at your desk. "If so much as one selfish person draws forth one of those devilish glowing rectangles, the audience as a whole breaks its suspension of disbelief! And, well, it's rude. I say we ban these devices in movie theaters. Kick the violators out for a start, and maybe fine them for a civil disturbance to get the message across."

2. "Why stop at movie theaters?" asks local snob @@RANDOM_NAME@@, well known for hosting extravagant parties. "There's other places where cell phone usage is annoying or rude. In the courthouse, at school, during speeches, or when I'm trying to host a fancy dinner. In fact, @@NAME@@ ought to have a lesson in good manners. Force all citizens to undergo mandatory etiquette training and teach respectable cell phone usage in schools. Perhaps then we won't rank just below those boorish Tasmanians in [i]World Travel Magazine[/i]."

3. "What is with all of you?" questions local teenager and film buff @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Screens can't possibly be that disruptive. You do know you can adjust the screen brightness on phones, right? Just, like, let people do what they want in the theater. In fact, maybe you should invest in infrastructure so we have better reception all over @@NAME@@."

[b][anchor=854]#854[/anchor]: An Armoury of Antiques [Vlanlados; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
After furtively photographing a massive military parade in Blackacre, your spies have returned with blurry daguerreotypes of the strangest of war machines. These include large bombs that can take to the air without any visible pilot, aircraft that have no propellers, and rifles that can fire many times without reloading. Concerned generals and army scientists have met to discuss the clear technological edge many nations seem to have over your own.

The Debate
1. "It's quite obvious what the issue here is," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, famed designer of the Mk 1 @@ANIMAL@@, a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ ironclad tank nicknamed the 'sardine cooker' by its crews. "We badly need more great minds in R&D, as it is quite clear that we are currently a little bit behind in war technology. If we can provide higher wages and more incentives for weapon designers and military research, I'm sure that in no time at all we'll have our very own high tech armaments!"

2. "This is a clear indication that we should stick to the old ways," counters retired General @@LASTNAME@@, by telegram. "If we add all these fancy new thingamajigs to our military, our soldiers will become soft! In fact, we should get rid of flying machines and armoured carriages, and focus on what really makes us powerful: spirit, courage, strength, and regiments of ten thousand men standing in a line firing muskets! Just like in the good old days."

[3]. "Look, we need to modernise, but we don't have the infrastructure or expertise to do so," observes your Minister of Trade, trying unsuccessfully to program @@HIS@@ VCR. "Let's just import new weapons from higher tech nations and employ foreign troops to use them for us against our enemies." [[color=blue]Must not have autarky[/color]]

4. "Personally, I see this in a different way," says a fashionable @@MAN@@ wearing a blue cashmere lounge suit and matching beret, who is lounging on your windowsill. "Instead of wasting money on an ineffective military, why don't you shrink the army and spend that money on new ways for people to enjoy themselves: parties for all-comers, new cocktails, new nibbles, and so on. Heck, we should just forget about fighting wars, and focus on what really matters: being the go-to party nation of @@REGION@@."

[b][anchor=855]#855[/anchor]: Thin Evidence [USS Monitor; ed:The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The spread of obesity in @@NAME@@ has fed a cottage industry of weight-loss gimmicks promising immediate results. After your Minister of Health was hospitalised with severe Vitamin B12 deficiency after she tried the [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Beach Miracle Diet[/i], officials are asking you to address the dangers of unhealthy fad diets.

The Debate
1. "A lot of these so-called 'diets' are invented by scam artists who don't know anything about nutrition and don't care about their customers' health," clamours Assistant Director of Public Health @@RANDOM_NAME@@, jabbing the air animatedly with a carrot. "We need tighter regulations to make sure only qualified dieticians can give dietary advice."

2. "What are you talking about?" chortles [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Beach Miracle Diet[/i] spokesperson Catherine Gratwick, as she languidly runs a bony hand through her fine hair. "Thanks to my miracle diet, hundreds of @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ have consciously uncoupled from their body mass. Now they've lost weight, look great, boosted their energy levels, and even improved their hearing! In fact, you should encourage our public-spirited endeavours with a small subsidy to help grow our small businesses. Just think how much nicer our beaches will be when they aren't covered with fat people."

3. "We would never have had this problem in the first place if we'd done a better job of educating our children about proper nutrition," chirrups Ministry of Health Press Secretary @@RANDOM_NAME@@, passing around a 'Get Well Soon' card in the shape of a giant pink rabbit holding a heart. "We need to invest in rigorous culinary arts programs and nutrition science classes in all @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ schools."

4. "You're all thinking too small," exclaims your Minister of Health's overzealous personal assistant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HIS@@ colleagues exchange nervous glances. @@HE@@ pulls a wedge of colorful pamphlets out of @@HIS@@ briefcase and passes them around the conference room. "You can give people all the information in the world, but some just don't listen. The only way to be sure everyone eats healthy is for us to directly control everything they consume. Imagine: food served through government cafeterias, nothing but healthy meals and reasonable portion sizes. Think on it: no obesity and no poverty. Free and wholesome food for all, delivered by the government that cares."

[b][anchor=856]#856[/anchor]: You Got Stones [Abhichandra; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A government-sponsored contest to find the best @@DEMONYMADJECIVE@@ sculptor was wildly successful, with a multitude of statues brought to the Ministry of Culture's marquee at the @@CAPITAL@@ Convention Center. Thanks to some small print in the competition's terms and conditions, the entries are now the property of the Ministry of Culture. Now there are tens of thousands of sculptures to dispose of, many of which are frankly terrible.

The Debate
1. "You must display all these works in a permanent gallery!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a dubiously-talented artist who placed 3587th in the contest. "It doesn't matter if people want to see these sculptures or not, as all art is part of the culture and history of our nation. Like that marble bust of you in the corner of your office, @@LEADER@@ - it's pretty ugly, but we still keep it around."

2. "We should distribute the sculptures en masse to our allies!" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Foreign Affairs, who you recall 'regifted' your birthday present to @@HIM@@ back to you last year. "They'll feel obliged to accept in order to maintain diplomatic politeness. And hey, what's so bad about spreading @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ culture around the world?"

3. "We should just demolish 'em," urges construction site fore@@MAN_1@@ @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, grabbing a delicate-looking ceramic anaglyptic and breaking it over @@HIS@@ knee for emphasis. "All we need is your permission, and an empty lot, and half-a-dozen bulldozers and steamrollers."

4. "Or we could repurpose these items," suggests your DIY-loving Uncle @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME, wearing a pair of dungarees he improvised from rubber bands and reclaimed umbrella fabric. "We can knock together all sorts of useful items if we put our minds to it: big paperweights, weights for the gym, weights to keep doors open, mobile phone cases... that weigh a lot. The choices are endless! Well, not exactly endless, but you know what I mean!"

[b][anchor=857]#857[/anchor]: Are You There God Particle? It's Me, @@LEADER@@ [Sedgistan; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
After a scientific experiment involving a cat, a steel chamber and a vial of radioactive waste went disastrously wrong - and led to the death of the cat to boot - people have begun to question whether the nation's pursuit of knowledge has caused it to lose touch with its humanity.

The Debate
1. "It's time we got a grip on ourselves," demands Dr. @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Schrödinger, clearing away flasks of hydrocyanic acid. "It's bad enough that the cat was lost, but even worse, the entire east wing of the Maxford University building has been irradiated! That'll set the Experimental Physics department back for decades. And all for what? To disprove an obscure theory of quantum mechanics. It's high time we had a central authority to vet research to ensure its integrity... and well, since my department is out of action, I humbly volunteer."

2. "It's time we got a grip on our goals," insists Dr. @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Milgram, affixing a set of electrodes on your secretary before handing you a large red button. "If we don't ask ourselves the fundamental questions, then what do we amount to but apes scratching around in the dirt with sticks? We need more freedom - and funding, of course - to have a hope of advancing our knowledge. Now press the button, please.

*3. "It's time we got a grip on our souls," begins noted astronomer @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Newton while winding up his pocket watch. "I agree with the good Dr. Schrödinger that there needs to be a central authority. Not a man-made one, but rather divine. The noble study of science needs to be brought back to its holy roots. It's about understanding His holy creation, not torturing small animals. Give the church full domain of our scientific pursuits so that we may bring our glorious nation back on the right side of the Lord." [[color=blue]Religion is legal[/color]]

*4. "It's time we got a grip on our souls!" cries a cloaked figure brandishing a geocentric map from a shadowy corner of your office. "You ruthlessly eradicated religious thought from our once-venerable nation and now you are reaping what you sow! There is only one choice for you, @@LEADER@@: the righteous one. Bring @@NAME@@ back into the glory of His kingdom. Scientific pursuits need not be abandoned, only tempered." [[color=red]Religion is illegal[/color]]

5. "It's time we realized there is nothing to grip," stoically states an unwashed ascetic outside your window. "Scientific pursuits are just man's ego trying to overcome the oneness of nature. Only when we succumb to mother nature and stop fighting her will we attain inner peace." An apple falls on @@HIS@@ head from the tree. @@HE@@ continues unfazed, "No more science. No more inquiries. No more questions. No more struggles."

[b][anchor=858]#858[/anchor]: Reporting For (Jury) Duty [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A Bigtopian defendant standing accused in a high profile murder trial criticised the randomly-selected jury assigned to as being biased against him, observing that the twelve included two known anti-immigrant agitators, a man-hating misandrist, a boy he bullied at school, and his estranged father. Concerns have arisen regarding how juries are selected.

The Debate
1. "It is possible for random selection to generate biased juries," states statistician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is about the only person who is actually excited to be called for jury duty. "We need a process to screen out biased prospects from juries, and aim to actively create balanced and fair juries that are representative of the values of the nation as a whole."

2. "It's the patriotic duty of every citizen to participate in juries," reminds your Justice Minister. "The fact that some people think of creative excuses to get out of it is offensive to say the least. We need to make jury duty mandatory for all citizens, and make the randomized selection the final selection. Picking and choosing jurors is too prone to corruption and legal manipulation, no matter how well-intentioned the selection process may be."

3. "Why have juries at all?" questions Judge @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ still clutching @@HIS@@ gavel from this morning's court session. "It's a proven fact that the majority of cases are already decided by who gets selected rather than by the evidence presented. All jurors have some subconscious bias that a questionnaire won't catch. All sentencing should be handled by a judge. The random person on the street probably has no idea how the criminal justice system works in @@NAME@@, so why not leave it to the professionals?"

[4]. "@@HIS_1@@ Honour Judge @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@ has a point. All human beings are susceptible to bias more than they realize," suggests tech enthusiast @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who famously augmented @@HIM@@self with robotic arms. "How many times has a jury convicted someone who was obviously innocent or vice versa because they were emotionally persuaded by the attorney? On the other hand, computers don't base their decision on emotions. They make decisions only on logic and cold hard facts. I propose that all courts should be run by automated systems that will leave no room for error." [[color=red]Must not have computers[/color] OR [color=red]Must have Body Integrity[/color]]

The Issue
An all-out fizzy soda war between the ancient Eckie-Cola and the younger, but significantly larger, Eckie-Ecola appears to be almost inevitable following Eckie-Ecola's decision to print their already similar labels an identical shade of pink. This has rendered visual distinction between the two brands rather difficult. As usual, you have been called in to mediate before the streets run red with cherry soda.

The Debate
1. "This is outrageous!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the representative of Eckie-Cola, as @@HE@@ slams one of @@HIS@@ company's products onto your desk. "We've been around in @@NAME@@ far longer than that Eckie-Ecola has been, even if they are more popular at the moment! This is a clear breach of our trademark and we demand that they change their name and logo! We deserve the sole rights to our title and any variations thereof!"

2. "That is outrageous!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the representative of Eckie-Ecola, also slamming a can of Eckie-Cola onto your desk, having mistaken it for one of @@HIS@@ company's own products. "So what if they came up with the name first? Everyone loves our products - we turn over way more product than those Eckie-Cola losers! What's the point of trademarks if they're getting in the way of consumer choice?"

3. "You two are outrageous," calmly mutters avid health enthusiast @@RANDOM_NAME@@, placing a kale smoothie on your desk. "Have you any idea how much sugar there is in a single can of these death-colas? And don't get me started on the preservatives! All sodas should be packaged in grey cans that specifically detail all of their contents and the hazards that come with them. That will hopefully lead to a community that is more health-conscious as well as knowledgeable."

The Issue
A teacher and four schoolchildren were killed on a field trip in a remote region of @@NAME@@ after an old anti-personnel mine was accidentally detonated. The landmines - relics of the nation's previous wars - have taken the lives of many over the years.

The Debate
1. "You can see how important demining is, no?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of Remove Landmine, an obscure private enterprise based in Bigtopia. "We clear @@NAME@@ of landmines for small price. No need to worry that forests obstruct progress; we remove them too, in big proud explosions. Bigtopian strength!"

2. "Not the Bigtopians!" screeches @@RANDOM_NAME@@, fierce patriot and even fiercer guerilla fighter, jumping out of a filing cabinet and tackling the Bigtopian businessperson to the ground. "When the Bigtopian warmongers attacked, we were forced to deploy landmines. Now they have the cheek to try and profiteer from our misery! We should seize all Bigtopian assets and use them to set up a demining fund instead!"

3. "I've got an idea!" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Minister of Education and part-time comedian, trying to stifle @@HIS@@ laughter. "Why don't we teach students proper demining techniques? I'm sure that it's going to be useful in their everyday lives... somehow. Anyway, it should prevent such an incident from ever occurring again."

4. "Actually, we don't need any of that," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an Army Logistics Supervisor, examining a map of @@NAME@@. "Since we were the ones who planted the mines, we could dig up some old documents on how to retrieve them. While it may be more costly than just purposefully detonating all of them, we should be able to reuse any functional ones that we come across. Although some of them might not work as well as newly-made weapons, this would provide a well-needed boost to our military stockpile."

[b][anchor=861]#861[/anchor]: Out With the Old [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Since you introduced a mandated age of death for your populace, argument has raged about the most seemly way for the elderly to be dispatched.

The Debate
1. "Let's just do it simply," states Logan Nolan, who celebrates his twenty-first birthday today. "Upon their last day, the dawn of their sixty-fifth birthday, everyone will walk into a House of Eternal Sleep, take leave of their loved ones and be euthanised with pleasure-inducing chemicals, to the soundtrack of their choice. And seeing as you'll have the facility built, you should also offer euthanasia to anyone else who wants or needs it."

2. "And suppose some selfish individualists don't turn up?" questions Ida-@@RANDOM_FIRST_NAMEFEMALE@@ Levine, toying with a metallic bracelet on her wrist. "Society must force people to make the right choice. Dose the nation's drinking water with a toxin, but give all citizens a daily 'vitamin' dose that contains a 24-hour antidote. When it's their 'perfect day', you simply cut off their antidote supply."

3. "Force is entirely unnecessary," soothes Alda Huxtable, showing off her tanned legs in a pair of white shorts. "People just need a little death-conditioning. If we teach young children that death is to be embraced, like any other natural process, we truly shall see the dawn of a brave new world. And then no-one shall fear their appointed day: slipping away in a quiet room, with drugs pumping through their veins and the TV blaring as they sip their final drinkie-poos. What spiffing fun!"

4. "No, you can't have..." gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your private secretary who turns sixty-five next month. "I thought that was some kind of misprint. Don't you realise the kind of experience you're losing when you kill the old people? Not just someone who's been there and done it, but an ear to listen no matter what mistake you've made or which country you've invaded. Besides, if you kill me, who'll care for my grandkid in the evenings? Well, I just wouldn't like to be there if you have to tell that little boy you've killed his grandparent."

[b][anchor=862]#862[/anchor]: Friends Close, Enemies Closer [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Proportional representation was instituted in the name of electoral fairness, but within that system it is far harder for any single party to establish an absolute majority of seats. Now, the General Election result is in, and your party has outperformed all others, but with less than 50% of the total popular vote. However, a coalition with one of the smaller and less popular parties would let you form a majority government, but only if you can agree to a deal.

The Debate
*1. "Give us a slice of the action," smiles Communist Party Chair @@RANDOM_NAME@@, placing a small iced sponge cake in front of you, and cutting @@HIM@@self the merest sliver. "We're not expecting you to end capitalism. We just want a little bit more wage equality and free market regulation." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. "Give us a slice of the action," smiles Capitalism Party President @@RANDOM_NAME@@, placing an enormous iced sponge cake in front of you, and cutting @@HIM@@self a decent wedge of it.

[3]. "All we ask is that you close the doors to those filthy immigrants!" spits @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Nationalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, seemingly disgusted by the colour of the dessert in front of @@HIM@@.

[4]. "Why not ally with a party that has no interest in ruling?" asks Libertarian @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has brought @@HIS@@ own strawberry cupcake, and doesn't look keen to share. "All we want is for you to shrink government a little bit, with the exception of police and military budgets. Then, we can support your new, leaner administration." [[color=purple]Must have a very large government[/color]]

[5]. "Heaven knows who is your best ally," comments @@FAITH@@ First party leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, drawing a holy symbol on the cake's icing with @@HIS@@ finger, "and as it turns out, I've got heaven on speed-dial. Increase spending on promoting @@FAITH@@ and recognising our state religion, and you'll have our support." [[color=purple]Must have a national religion[/color] AND [color=purple]must have low religiousness[/color]]

[6]. "Don't deal with all these extremists!" scolds Green Party representative Hermes Deming, calculating the carbon footprint of the proffered pudding. "All we Greens want is a little more green thinking and regulation. Unlike those other lunatics, our approach will actually make you MORE popular with the mainstream."
 [[color=purple]Must have a very poor environment[/color]]

[7]. "If you're looking for people that play well with others, then look no further," suggests Pacifist Party member @@RANDOM_NAME@@, taking the moral high ground by declining cake despite @@HIS@@ audible hunger-induced tummy rumbles. "Give peace a chance. Cut back military spending a little, disarm your WMDs and become a better person. Like me." @@HE@@ smiles at you smugly. [[color=purple]Must have WMDs and high military spending[/color]]

8.

[b][anchor=863]#863[/anchor]: Oiling the Wheels of Diplomacy [Argentinstan; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The nation of Althaniq is a small autocratic desert monarchy that trades oil to @@NAME@@ and in turn is almost wholly dependent on @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ exports. Recently, several nations larger and more powerful than Althaniq have denounced it and introduced punitive trade sanctions and embargoes against them, citing their belief that Althaniq is sheltering and funding terrorist organizations.

The Debate
1. "We, your strategic allies and fellow democratic nations, are voicing our disapproval of totalitarian Althaniq," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an ambassador from Brancaland. "You should join us in condemning their pro-terrorist inclinations and imposing a total trade embargo to force them to change their ways. We have considerable evidence showing that they are funding terrorist cells in Brancaland and many other nations, and they've probably been secretly undermining your nation too! They must not be trusted!"

2. "We can't afford to listen to that old hag," scoffs your Finance Minister. "Althaniq trade brings considerable prosperity to our economy. I personally... uh, I mean to say [i]we as a nation[/i], make oodles of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ from our exports to them, and our petrochemical-reliant industries benefit massively from their low per-barrel prices. This so-called evidence isn't proof of guilt, and why is it even our business what our trading partners get up to in their dealings with other nations? In fact, with so many nations embargoing them, we'll be able to exploit their desperation to demand even lower oil prices. Let's strengthen trade instead, then sit back and profit."

3. "Ignore those weaklings!" yells your Minister of Defense, slamming a knife point-first into the table, and knocking over your coffee pot. "This is a perfect time to invade Althaniq! They're without friends in the world, and they have all those oil wells that would be so much better in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ hands. Hell, we've even got military bases inside their national borders already, to use as staging camps. Let's strike now, before they suspect anything!"

4. "Has everyone gone out of their minds?" cries your Minister of Underdogs, helping your elderly cleaning lady mop up the spilled coffee. "We should be assisting Althaniq in their time of need, to show that @@NAME@@ looks after its friends rather than judges them. @@LEADER@@, you're a fair person, right? I humbly suggest that you pick up half the tab for any trade goods our exporters sell to Althaniq, and maybe also offer to increase the price we pay for Althaniq oil. That should see them through these troubling times!"

The Issue
Sixty-nine @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ missionaries representing @@FAITH@@ were kidnapped and burned at the stake in a small nation bordering Lilliputia. The infamous radical Violetist sect [i]Ultra-Violet[/i] has claimed responsibility for this heinous act. Concerned religious leaders and diplomats have contacted your office to clarify the nation's stance on overseas proselytism.

The Debate
1. "I do not blame these misguided heathens, @@LEADER@@. I blame you!" bellows @@FAITH@@'s outraged leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shouting down the phone until your ear hurts. "Our brave missionaries travel to the darkest, most dangerous areas of the globe to bring the loving light of @@FAITH@@ to the unbelievers. We cannot expect these poor souls to share our traditional values, but we should be able to rely on a little protection from our armed forces, no? Perhaps a helicopter gunship or two could have averted this tragedy."

2. "Perhaps we should tend to our own flock first?" questions rural lay-preacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is clad in sackcloth and an aura of self-loathing. "We should lead not by proselytising our faith abroad but by nurturing @@FAITH@@ within our own borders. Some of the villages I visit barely have a prayer book between them! Just think, for every missionary we pay to send overseas we could instead repair our dilapidated places of worship. Perhaps we might even buy the occasional new pair of shoes for humble preachers like myself?"

3. "A tragedy, @@LEADER@@," coos Lilliputian ambassador @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clucking @@HIS/HER@@ tongue. "Rest assured, Lilliputia is shocked and angered by this violent assault on your dear people. Our nation has been plagued by Ultra-Violetists for decades now, though we've lacked the international support to do anything about it! However, our shared history makes us natural allies... even if your people are a bunch of land-swindling children of rabbit droppings. But with your valued diplomatic support - say, selling us arms for generous compensation - we could end this and all menaces at our borders. Oh, and if you happened to send some missionaries here..." @@HE/SHE@@ nonchalantly gestures towards another small nation on Lilliputia's border.

@@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, the controversial former head of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ military, suddenly died in @@HIS@@ home last night. While @@HE@@ was beloved by many for @@HIS@@ unapologetic patriotism and military service, @@HE@@ was loathed by others for @@HIS@@ xenophobia and alleged war crimes. @@HE@@ is proving to be just as controversial in death as @@HE@@ was in life as you have been asked to honor @@HIM@@ with a state funeral.

The Debate
1. "@@HE@@ was a hero and a true patriot!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the current head of @@NAME@@'s military. "Of course @@HE_1@@ should be presented with a state funeral and full honors! In fact, we should declare a week of mourning and erect a statue of @@HIM_1@@ in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Square. Damn the expense!

2. "A funeral for a fascist and a fiend like @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@? No way!" rebuffs civil rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while spraying graffiti over an official bust of the deceased. "Is that the message we want to send to the rest of @@REGION@@? That we honor mass murderers and bigots?

[3]. "This is a classic no-win scenario," notes your personal assistant as @@HE_2@@ begins to clean the defaced sculpture. "The best thing you can do is put the matter to a vote in Parliament, and let our elected representatives decide.

4. "Why bother with state funerals at all?" queries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chairperson of the [i]Angry Taxpayers Federation[/i]. "Talk about a perfectly good waste of our hard-earned money! Let the family of the deceased cover the cost of the funeral so the government can get back to more important things like lowering taxes and cutting government spending."

The Issue
Healthcare professionals around the country are in an uproar due to a five-month shortage of the popular broad-spectrum antibiotic dankomycin, despite claims by the drug manufacturer that production levels are currently adequate for market demand.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, this is simply unacceptable," rages @@CAPITAL@@ General Hospital Chief of Staff @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ C. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, twirling @@HIS@@ stethoscope like a pair of nunchukas. "These companies own the patents for dankomycin and other drugs that are currently facing shortage. This means no other companies can produce these drugs, and our patients continue to suffer. Drug patents should be cancelled when supplies are short so that others can take up the production shortfall, and so we can treat our patients properly."

2. "Now wait just a minute!" exclaims Mizer CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ struggles against @@LASTNAME_1@@. "By releasing the patent we will never be able to recoup our R&D costs and create new medications! If anything, you need to take a good hard look at retraining those crackpot doctors who keep giving antibiotics to everyone with the sniffles! If they weren't so liberal with their prescribing then we wouldn't need so many new antibiotics in the first place!"

3. "You know, all this talk of copyrights and the cost of researching drugs has me thinking about the overall process," states your Secretary of Health @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What if we just got rid of the regulations that lead to expensive medications? If drug companies aren't spending so much money on testing and research and development then surely that will decrease the cost of drugs at the consumers' end!"

4. "Surely you can't be serious about gutting consumer protections!" exclaims Minister of Regulations @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Those regulations are in place for a purpose: to protect the public! Even so, changing regulations will do nothing to ease the shortage of the vaunted dankomycin anyways. The only option forward is plainly obvious. Force the drug companies who own the patents to manufacture enough medication until this and any future shortages are relieved."

5. Suddenly, without warning, your least favorite aunt from your mother's side bursts into your office. "Junior, don't you know that the drugs our people are taking are filled with dirty chemicals such as magnesium stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate? Instead of drugs, you should provide people with organic herbs such as the ones my health guru sold me!" Before you can reply, she shoves a handful of repulsive 'herbs' into your mouth, which you realize are nothing more than common garden flowers.

The Issue
A televised news exposé on the public's shocking ignorance of national history was almost thwarted when journalist Murray Shafer couldn't find any visitors to interview at the Museum of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ History. The report instead aired as a folksy monologue. Within sixty minutes, your office was besieged by all kinds of people who claim to have found the perfect solution.

The Debate
1. "The younger generations are bored with the current offerings," says recently-graduated psychologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE/SHE@@ looks up from @@HIS/HER@@ phone for a split second. "When I visit the Museum of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ History, I don't just want to stare at some ancient objects. What we really need is interaction, and the best way to provide this is through technology. Children are more eager to learn when you use video clips and games to explain history. Imagine being chased by holographic velociraptors at the Museum of Natural History! That would be money well spent, in my opinion."

2. "The real problem is that the average adult appears to have forgotten everything they learned in school," asserts self-proclaimed aristocrat @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while swinging around @@HIS/HER@@ wine glass and staining your carpet. "In fact, most people seem completely ignorant of whether @@NAME@@ even existed before you became our leader! How can you expect them to visit museums without an appreciation for history that is repeatedly inculcated throughout their lives? We need to increase government funding for ongoing adult education before expecting the common people to enjoy visiting a museum."

*3. "How can you expect anyone to visit @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ museums?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who entered your office to use the free wi-fi connection. "Face it. An imagination doesn't have any interesting museums. The Museum of Regional Geography? The Historical House of Hammers? The Gallery of Retail? Come on! The fact of the matter is, the museums are boring. There's nothing but mundane themes, dull exhibitions, and tiresome pieces. Let's build some new, up-to-date museums with things we'd all like to see." [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

[b][anchor=868]#868[/anchor]: All In The Family [Drasnia; ed: Nation of Quebec & Wyethalania][/b]

The Issue
An unexpected letter sent by your estranged uncle was found on your desk this morning. In it, he details what he has been up to for the past several years. It abruptly concludes with him being arrested and imprisoned in Brancaland for a slew of criminal charges. These included selling diluted maple syrup, illegally hunting prized Brancalandian Geese for sport, and operating a business without a license.

The Debate
1. "I'm in a sticky situation," writes your uncle. "I've been assigned to share a cell with a moonshiner named Cletus. His buck teeth are not pleasant to look at nor are his armpits pleasant to smell. I would be most obliged if you could use some of your diplomatic wrangling, such as threatening Brancaland with tariffs, to arrange for my release. Perhaps you could wire some money to my account to help me get back on my feet. After all, we're family, and as the Brancalandian saying goes, 'blood is thicker than maple syrup'."

2. The Brancalandian ambassador huffs into your office. "You must understand what a heinous crime your uncle committed. Our maple products are our national heritage and your uncle has completely disrespected that. He may be your family, but you must allow our criminal justice system to punish him as it sees fit. If you'd like, we can even give you a tour of the prison facilities to show that he isn't being mistreated."

3. "This kind of sounds like one of those Tasmanian Prince scams to me," muses your secretary. "Actually, that gives me an idea. Deny that he's your uncle and write him off as a con artist trying to get out of prison. If we are to believe that ambassador, he won't be in much actual danger there. Sure, he won't be happy staying locked up, and neither will other family members now that I think about it. Then again, he broke Brancalandian law and I don't want to risk losing my supply of Brancalandian goose down coats over this!"

The Issue
With rising world tensions, many people are clamoring for nuclear bunkers.

The Debate
1. "We need a communal shelter in each major city for when the inevitable global nuclear war arrives," declares Ivana Locke, self-proclaimed concrete pouring expert, who is phoning in on her two-hour drive from @@ANIMAL@@ City to @@CAPITAL@@. "You spend the money, and you do it right. You make one mistake, @@NAME@@, one tiny little mistake, and the whole world comes crashing down around you. It'd also be a worthy public works project, helping the unemployed now and for the foreseeable future."

*2. "I agree we do need bunkers, but Ms. Locke has not gone far enough," worries paranoid local @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You hear about the four-minute warning? That's how much time we have to get to shelter. Everybody deserves to survive the nuclear apocalypse, not just those who are lucky enough to be close to a communal vault. You should have one shelter for every @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ home. I know, I know, too expensive - that's why you make it a building regulation, and force home builders to meet that standard." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "I agree we do need bunkers, but Ms. Locke has not gone far enough," mutters agoraphobe Enver Gjirokastër, building a fort under your desk with stacks of manila folders. "The protection of the nation requires bunkers not just as fallout shelters, but also to employ defence-in-depth against an infantry attack. Every worker must be able to contribute as an impromptu militiaman to the noble endeavour of safeguarding our nation! You should have a series of one-man shelters, perhaps one for every @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ home. As an added benefit, that means those of us who live alone can stay that way, when the apocalypse comes." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "Why bother with coward-houses when our enemy could be eradicated before they could consider striking us?" asks political hawk @@RANDOM_NAME@@, swatting a fly on the wall with a double-handed axe. "No complicated shenanigans either, just a small increase to our nuclear arsenal to make us capable of destroying the very planet we stand upon. Nobody would be that crazy to attack us if we had that!"

5. "I think I speak for all sane folk when I say we don't need this rubbish," offers a passer-by from outside your window. "Nukes are just for posturing - nobody ever uses them! I read that in Brasilistan they got rid of their nuclear deterrents altogether, and I don't think it ever hurt them. We should give the taxpayer a break by paring back our military, committing to no nukes, and living our lives in pleasure. I'm not paying for an event that may or may not even happen! And if I'm wrong, we'll all be dead anyway."

6. "You know, we could save money by investing in just one super-luxurious fallout shelter," observes trans-humanist visionary Roberta House, via a video call. "Build one just for the ten thousand or so people that really matter - the politicians and leaders of industry. You can keep a freezer full of sperm and eggs from carefully-picked beautiful and brilliant individuals, to help maintain future genetic diversity. Let the common folk worry about the ramifications of the nuclear winter for themselves. A hundred or so years later, our descendants will emerge. Humanity will be reborn from the brightest, the best, and the wealthiest!"

[b][anchor=870]#870[/anchor]: @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ Literally Exploding With Excitement [Singapore no2; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
For a time now, there have been rumours of citizens spontaneously exploding during moments of extreme happiness. You originally believed it to be either an urban myth or a metaphor, but you soon realised that it was no hoax after an ebullient health official combusted in front of you after a long-due promotion. As your security staff were about to hustle you away, your Minister of Information revealed the truth to you. It turns out that the subcutaneous identification chips implanted in @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ have a few technical glitches, and occasionally explode.

The Debate
1. "It seems that I failed to disclose the risks inherent in these chips," admits @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Minister of Information, who is examining a blueprint for the device. "While it may be tempting to do away with them, you must remember the purposes that they serve. These chips help to monitor our citizens, store health metadata and simplify bureaucratic processes, saving time and resources. We'll just have to try to find a solution for the problem and hope that no more incidents happen in the meantime."

2. "This cannot continue!" exclaims Minister for Health @@RANDOM_NAME@@, still shell-shocked and viscera-splattered by the horrifying death of one of @@HIS@@ best employees. "I was already against implanting electronic parts into our citizens for no good reason, but putting their lives on the line is going too far. We must remove all of these hazardous chips before any more lives are needlessly lost!"

3. "So you're telling me that these chips explode when emotions flare?" inquires @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Chief of Police. "There are many criminals still at large in our country, and they're always one step ahead of us. If we were to damage their chips - perhaps by flooding the media with concepts that would shock normal folk but make criminals happy - we would be able to execute the criminals remotely and at no cost to the police. If there's nothing left to arrest... then justice has been served, am I right?"

The Debate
1. "Power to the people!" shouts manifesto co-author @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while starting up the building's backup generator as the electricity cuts off. "We need to form peaceful, voluntary workers' co-operatives across @@NAME@@. Now more than ever we need true socialism, not another oppressive, bureaucratic hierarchy. Picture it: as the means of production are placed into the workers' hands, they'll be able to decide for themselves what to produce, how what they produce is used, and when to show up for work. It'll be wonderful!"

2. "Spies, saboteurs, and traitors are at the center of our economic woes," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your mustachioed Minister of Anti-Revisionism, while attempting to drive a T-34 tank into the building. "Only a strong, centralized state can protect the revolution. We need more party control over factories, we need to forcibly collectivize all farmland, and we need to increase police funding to make sure it all gets done."

[3]. "Full automation, @@LEADER@@!" cackles your worryingly eccentric science advisor while working on plans for the latest spy satellite. "The people aren't receiving enough food and medicine and whatnot due to our antiquated systems of distribution. If we automated these systems using my latest resource planning software, we could one-up those inefficient bureaucrats in Central Planning!

Maybe a decade or two, actually." [[color=blue]Must not ban computers[/color] OR [color=purple]Good Scientific Advancement[/color]]

4. "Socialism in only one country is a failure!" proclaims bespectacled minister Leon Bone, stroking his goatee. "Only a global revolution can be truly successful. We must strengthen ties and form economic unions with other revolutionary nations, like East Lebatuck, to ensure that we can meet the basic needs of our people. We must also fund left-wing rebels abroad, and if it comes to it, we need to commit to war in order to propel the world into a new era of communism. We may become an international pariah, but what do we care of the opinions of capitalist pigs?"

5. "Maybe we've been heading in the wrong direction," suggests Minister of Resource Allocation @@RANDOM_NAME@@, nervously speaking at a low volume so that only you can hear @@HIM@@. "Our current system just can't keep up with all of the @@POPULATION@@ people in the nation.

[b][anchor=873]#873[/anchor]: Terrified Testimony! [Euro-Asiata; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
A hung jury and subsequent mistrial was declared yesterday in the case of the murder of Rachel Swanson, the wife of writer and actor Dave Swanson. While the evidence seemed to clearly point to Swanson, the matter was muddled by the fact that he had been writing an exposé of Mendesmetetics, a dubious religious organization that he and his wife had recently left. Now prosecution, defense, and special interests have gathered in your office to loudly debate the ground rules for the retrial.

The Debate
1. "The behaviour the defense exhibited in the courtroom was obscene!" harrumphs prosecutor Mack McJoy, pounding his fist on your desk and sending stationary flying. "Instead of presenting a case, this hack of a lawyer simply resorted to fear-mongering about the horrors of Mendesmetetics. Three jurors apparently feigned illness for fear of reprisals from this wackadoo cult and my star witness refused to testify! If we are to maintain the integrity of the legal system, we must crack down on these dubious practices. Force witnesses to testify, make jury evasion a felony, and tighten the restrictions on what is and isn't admissible in court!"

2. "You don't understand," explains defense attorney Jackie Cochran while stuffing newspaper into a pair of gloves. "Those jurors, along with everyone else in that room, had good reason to be afraid. This sinister cult doesn't take kindly to those who betray them. I guarantee they have information on everyone who sat in that juror's box. Representatives of Mendesmetetics were even sitting in the front row of the courtroom, staring down my witnesses! With the kind of resources they have at their disposal, I'm certain that these nutjobs killed Rachel Swanson and framed my client. If you want justice, you have to protect us from the real villains. Give round-the-clock security to witnesses, jurors, and lawyers, or you'll be responsible for whatever happens!"

3. A dapper gentleman in a suit who you recognize as the head of your crime prevention task force taps you on the shoulder. "I think we can see the real issue here. Terrified juries? Witness intimidation? Fear of reprisal? This is all an impediment to swift and brut- I mean, fair justice. Simply do away with juries and bar the public and press from courtrooms, and we can make all of these problems disappear."

[b][anchor=876]#876[/anchor]: Sequels: The Saga Continues [Nation of Quebec; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
After the ban on sequels, the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ film industry has produced films that have been praised by critics and won multiple awards, but which have bombed at the box office. The lack of revenue is worrying studio executives, producers, and moviegoers alike.

The Debate
1. "We need our popcorn flicks back!" complains film director Michel Cove, who holds the 'Most Explosions on a Film Set' record.  "I haven't made a single film since the ban, and the masses are emptying out of movie theaters.  Sure, my [i]TransMorphers[/i] series isn't some pretentious arthouse bull that sweeps the awards, but it does bring the big bucks, and that's exactly what the industry needs right now.  Not to mention this ban tramples on my freedom of expression."

2. "Allowing sequels will only continue the dumbing down of this once-great nation," suggests film critic Gene Ebert, giving his trademark thumbs down to the director.  "There was a reason why we banned them, you know.  Films like [i]To Kill a Laughing Bird[/i] or [i]Citizen Bone[/i] might not make a killing at the box office, but they tell beautiful and important stories that might not otherwise get to touch the world.  The film industry simply needs to do a better job at advertising them.  Perhaps a little government funding could go a long way."

3. "Perhaps there's a compromise," suggests your movie buff niece, who had just come back from her [i]Star Battles[/i] marathon.  "What if we allow some sequels, but only if the original film is a commercial [i]and[/i] a critical success?  This means no more [i]Mildly Spooky Movie[/i] sequels, but it'll allow the excellent [i]Planet of the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@[/i] series to continue.  It may not please everyone, but I think that's a more than fair alternative."

The Issue
The diplomatic peace process between historic enemies Maxtopia and North Bigtopia is gaining momentum, to the delight of many who have worked hard to end this decades-long conflict. However, many @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ defence contractors are feeling less than celebratory, as the outbreak of peace has led to both nations cancelling longstanding and lucrative arms deals.

The Debate
1. "We've got cancellations on multiple big-ticket items, including a squadron of Blue @@ANIMAL@@ fighter jets," complains arms manufacturing bigwig @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Jobs and profit margins are at risk! If you want a healthy defence industry in this country, you have to persuade the two nations to renew their contracts. If that means napalming them until they comply, then so be it! Shall I put you down for a dozen long-range bombers?"

2. "Look, we don't have to be so blatant about things," whispers your new janitor, who you realize is actually the CEO of Armat Battlefield Systems in an elaborate wig. "All you need is a dozen of your most loyal and discreet black ops soldiers wearing Maxtopian uniforms and carrying M41s, the rifle of choice of the Maxtopian Colonial Marine. Send them into North Bigtopia, have them shoot up a government building, and make sure they're caught on camera. Next thing you know, we'll all be back in business."

[3]. "Sometimes markets change; we just have to adapt," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the pragmatic director of a start-up company specialising in fragmentary grenades. "Maybe the thing to do is to get rid of any restrictions on civilian ownership of military vehicles and weapons, and let us make more sales to the masses rather than to nation-states. I mean, what red-blooded young man wouldn't like his own mobile missile launcher?" [[color=blue]Must not ban cars[/color]]

4. "Why don't we go with the flow rather than make war on the peace process?" asks Diplomatic Corps Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, bringing you a nice cup of tea. "Scale down our own military spending, subsidise business interests that can profit from peace in the region, and let our own economy become less dependent on manufacturing the tools of destruction.

Horrifyingly, there continues to be whispered dissent against your glorious and righteous rule.

The Debate
1. "War is peace," asserts your Minister of Peace, wiping blood from a stainless steel truncheon with a velvet cloth. "Nothing brings a nation together like an external enemy. Find a strategically inferior nation to declare war on, exaggerate their threat with demonising propaganda, and watch as the proles unite behind you in hatred of your shared foe."

2. "Freedom is slavery," observes your Minister of Plenty, while carrying out his daily physical jerks to keep himself fit. "Grab those who complain, and strip them of their liberty by putting them to forced labour in service of the state. Good citizens will have the incentive to behave better, and our economy will benefit from a costless workforce."

3. "Ignorance is strength," quacks your Minister of Truth, going through the dictionary with a black marker, and striking out words she doesn't like. "We need to reduce the nation's capacity for critical thinking, for unpatriotic doubt and for rebellious intellectualism. Blissful unreason, with a vocabulary that is too limited to express dangerous ideas - that is how we achieve a compliant population."

The Issue
After an engineer accidentally deactivated an electrical failsafe, parts of @@NAME@@ were plunged into darkness as a power surge swept through the grid, destroying many pieces of electronic equipment. What should have been a quick routine analysis soon turned into a criminal negligence investigation after it transpired that several AI citizens perished due to the surge. Now, people are unable to decide who - or what - is to blame.

The Debate
1. "This is an outrage!" angrily beeps Sal5000, a well-known AI and prominent activist. "Many of my friends and neighbours were killed by this power surge and legal action needs to be taken immediately. If a human had been deprived of oxygen through gross negligence, wouldn't we press charges? The engineer in question must be held responsible for this... um.... AIslaughter?"

2. "Don't get me wrong, I respect AIs as much as the next man, or machine," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the engineer's manager. "But surely you can see there has to be some sort of moderation here. All the engineer did was cut the wrong wire and the whole grid went down. Have you seen how complex those transformer stations are? My staff need better training, and government bursaries to pay for it."

3. "I do outstanding work, and people are trying to blame me!" protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, architect of the nation's electrical grid. "People are using far more electricity now than when we built the infrastructure. It's hardly my department's fault that we've not got the budget to modernise our network. If the government wants to prevent this from happening in the future, they should invest in upgrading the power grid."

4. "Now all the AI 'lives' being lost are of course tragic, but what about the expense?" questions your infamously greedy Finance Minister, who sits lovingly caressing a pile of coins. "These AIs cost a fortune to upgrade now we can't simply throw out obsolete models so why don't we take a... different approach. Remember the old days, when if a robot broke you bought a new one? Wasn't the world better - and cheaper - then? Go back to treating AIs as the machines they are, and all this fuss can be over."

The Issue
The oldest versions of the popular children's book, [i]Little Violet Voyaging Veil[/i], have been released to the public, and are causing quite a stir amongst the more conservative teachers of @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "I didn't much care for the story from the beginning," mutters kindergarten teacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, fanning @@HIM@@self with a handkerchief, "but when I found out about this, I was flatout disgusted!  Did you know that in one of the original versions, both of them are voraciously eaten by the wolf, while another shows the protagonist actually eating the grandmother?  These stories were obviously not made for kids, and it is revolting that we still encourage our children to read these same stories with a bit of sugar-coating.  We must ban stories like these from ever being sold!"

2. "Oh, please!  It's just a harmless fairy-tale," dismisses Tom S. Boulder, the author of many bestselling but tepid rewrites.  "Modern children's stories are only loosely based on their original versions, anyway.  Even the originals often bore little resemblance to one another.  Just incentivise authors to focus on the gentle and positive aspects of these lovely stories, like in my version, [i]Miniature Yellow Traveling Goods Salesman[/i], and no one should have anything to worry about."

3. "You shouldn't shelter children from any of these books - period!" Ro Jennifer complains, thumbing through a copy of an unveiled original with a terrifying cover.  "Heck, they used to be around to make sure kids don't end up in a similar situation!  If you put so much as a dusting of sugar on them, they'll be pointless.  We should be encouraging kids to take a look at the darker original stories so they can begin to see the blood-drenched, brutal, naked reality of the world as it truly is."

Your sister, who is an auction addict, has just given you a pot of white-dotted pink Gallopavian gladioli. She purchased it at auction for 500,000 @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@, which she insists was a great bargain. Taking advantage of this, your financial advisors are prodding you to consider the possibility that gladiolus prices may have gone out of control in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "Your sister could have bought a fancy apartment in downtown @@CAPITAL@@ for that sum!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Finance Minister, leaning over the pot to sniff the flowers and turning away in disgust. "Eww, and they don't even smell nice! This only shows that we have a gladiolus bubble building up, and Violet only knows when it will burst, blowing away the investors' money and collapsing our economy. A financial crisis is the last thing we need now. You should set a ceiling trading price for gladioli and other goods that deviate too far from their actual intrinsic values, and put an end to unstable markets based on frenzied speculation!"

2. "Whoa, since when do we meddle with the free market economy?" asks Viceroy O. J. Busbeck, a flamboyant merchant, who is renowned for his Gallopavian gladiolus corm importing business. "You can't put a price on these gorgeous flowers! Well... I mean to say, you can. You know what I mean! Do you know how much effort and expertise are required to cultivate these rare gladiolus varieties?

I'll even wrap them up in a small bouquet for you! Speculative trading is a guaranteed win-win, right? Just buy flowers, and watch our economy blossom!"

3. "Well, after a while the bloom will be off the gladiolus. What will you do then?" muses Agricultural Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Paying crazy amounts of money for these corms enriches Gallopavia and is wrecking our balance of trade. But I know a way out of this. @@LEADER@@, we should subsidise flower farmers to cultivate our own surprisingly-similar gladioli, and undercut Gallopavian traders in the international market.

Now some parents are saying that @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ schools need to do more to protect students with food allergies.

The Debate
1. "How could the school allow this?" wails @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAMEFEMALE@@ @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, the mother of the @@BOY_2@@ who died. "It's totally irresponsible! Students shouldn't be allowed to bring food from home and cafeterias should only serve food that no one is allergic to."

2. "Life is like a box of chocolates," says renowned sprinter Forrest Gumbo, apparently oblivious to how tone-deaf he sounds. "You never know what you're gonna get. If you ban peanuts, you'll get a student who's allergic to shellfish. If you ban shellfish, you'll get a student who's allergic to wheat. You can't ban it all.

The Issue
Mesozoic Park, the largest dinosaur zoo in the country, has made the headlines for yet another disastrous dinosaur escape. Apparently, the gate of a [i]Tyrannosaurus Rex[/i] pen malfunctioned, giving the horde of formerly captive reptiles a window to flee their enclosure. The liberated T-Rex horde then proceeded to go on a rampage through @@CAPITAL@@, killing hundreds and wrecking city infrastructure. Following the crisis, many citizens are calling for the closure of dinosaur zoos.

The Debate
1. "We cannot allow the zoo to continue like this!" demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a frustrated cleaner, who has been toiling for hours mopping up innumerable gallons of blood from the streets. "Those dumb behemoths completely leveled several streets, and would have continued if not for that surprisingly muscular palaeontologist motorcyclist, those two annoying kids and that conveniently located fireworks factory nearby. I'm not saying that we should destroy these creations, but we shouldn't be putting them on display and giving them opportunities to run loose."

2. "This is an overreaction," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Head of Scientific Research, who doesn't appear to be remotely disturbed by the high body count. "While there may be some downsides to having dinosaurs on display to the public, the research data that we can draw from them is irreplaceable.

A palace guard had to torture one of your most trusted aides today after hearing him murmur to another advisor that the WA has classified your beloved nation as a psychotic dictatorship. After your brother related the torture in gory detail during a family dinner, the topic of how to improve your image with the WA has come up.

The Debate
1. "Let the people have a bit of political freedom," announces your nephew, whose authoritarianism is tempered only by his strange love for democracy. "The people love you and your tough but fair demeanor! Get the rubber stamp of a democratically free vote and you'll get to keep the populace in check - and maybe the WA will back off with their 'psychotic' talk."

2. "The only freedom @@NAME@@ needs is freedom on the entrepreneurial front," proposes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a shady Eckie-Ecola executive known for @@HIS/HER@@ iron-fisted consumerism, who is currently serving Eckie-Ecolas to your family. "You should focus on promoting big multinational businesses in @@NAME@@ and slashing the regulation on them.

5. "Don't listen to those anarchists from the World Assembly," comments your sister, while simultaneously offering her after-dinner cake to the butler that served it to her. "Just because they can't see that you're helping your citizens by giving them structure does not mean that you're doing anything wrong.

Imagine the windfall for Mountain Spew Inc. - not to mention my stock portfolio - if all @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ have to switch to soft drinks and energy drinks to get their fixes."

Popular TV show [i]@@ANIMAL@@ the Bounty Hunter[/i] was recently canceled after the eponymous fugitive-finder accidentally shot and killed three innocent bystanders. Now, the legality of the profession of bounty hunting is being called into question.

The Debate
1. "Those bounty hunters ain't nothin' but trouble, creating a grand ol' fuss wherever they go," drawls Sheriff @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while holstering @@HIS@@ six-shooter. "I reckon bounty huntin' ought not be allowed. Us lawmen can deal with outlaws just fine ourselves! Problem is, ma deputies are busier than a centipede at a leg-countin' contest. We need to up our police spendin' somethin' fierce, then we'll have these criminals whupped soon enough."

2. "Cops are too concerned with the 'order' part of law and order," states the leather-clad, heavily-tattooed bounty hunter. "We hunters can get the job done, and if we don't, you don't have to pay us. While cops are too busy scarfing down doughnuts and taking 'sensitivity training' to catch the bad guys, we're out in the real world, on the trail of the outlaws.

The Debate
1. "Photograph enhancement is nothing new, darling," slurs renowned fashion designer Carla Largerfield. "For my clothes to look as gorgeous as possible, we need to make our models look as gorgeous as possible! If that means adjusting them down in post, then that's what we do. We're selling a dream of something better, not tawdry reality. What right does the government have to dictate how we edit our magazines? Besides, it's not like we're hurting anyone."

2. "Not hurting anyone, she says! LIES!" screams social worker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Young girls across @@NAME@@ read her magazines and think they need to conform to the faked physiques they see. Let's not even talk about the implicit racism in deliberately whitening skin tones! I implore you, make photographic enhancement of models illegal, for the sake of the children!"

3. "Simply banning photo-editing is insufficient," proclaims plus-sized pop star Megan Plimsoll. "It's abhorrent that only tall, slim women are considered for modelling jobs when the clothes will be sold to women of all shapes and sizes. I suggest a government mandate declaring that fashion designers must fairly represent women of every size on their catwalks and in their photoshoots. Only then can we start to fight inequality in the fashion industry."

4. Your Minister for Friendly Solutions, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, suggests an alternative solution: "How about instead of setting quotas or inflicting bans, we try and change society. Let art bring forth a candle. A big fat tallow candle. I suggest you tax the fashionistas and use that money to subsidize artists who are making positive depictions of the plus sized: a big-boned bronze statue here, a Rubenesque nude there.

3. "We might have to compromise a little to stay in business," concedes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the self-proclaimed 'Admiral of the Black', whose operations haven't been in the black for years. "We should avoid plundering ships from nations with large navies like Macronesia; we don't want to be bilged on our own anchor after all. However, many other nations - such as Moltovea - lack a proper navy and are easy pickings. You should enforce a rule that prohibits the pillaging of vessels from countries with naval superiority.

[b][anchor=891]#891[/anchor]: Preach It! [Glacikaldr; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Street preachers delivering their sermons and self-proclaimed salvation have been popping up all over @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "These people chase all of my customers away!" exclaims restaurateur @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I own a premier establishment in downtown @@CAPITAL@@. Every day I lose more and more business thanks to these crazy bigots and extremists rambling on about the 'end times' and 'confessing our sins'! One of them tried to convert my cook! For the sake of every business owner in the nation, you must ban street preaching."

2. "What about my right to speak the truth?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who often holds impromptu 'sermons' outside of government buildings. "As opposed to popular belief, I do not preach hate. I am the deliverer of salvation and you shall not interfere! All @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ are equal before our Creator and will be judged irrespective of wealth or status! Follow me and together we will be prepared to face the end days to come!"

3. "There is a better way to go about this," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Compromises. "The most common complaints against street preaching are on the grounds of harassment and noise pollution. I say the most logical approach is to administer permits to those who wish to speak on public property, with a police presence to make sure they don't cause any trouble. That's fair, right?"

The Issue
Switching over to the metric system has certainly benefited your scientists and other such intellectuals. The common populace, however, is expressing a measure of doubt.

The Debate
1. "It's such a headache!" complains celebrity chef @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, brandishing a sauce-covered calculator. "I'd need to be an accountant to convert all my old recipes, and how do you expect me to quickly know how much broth I need when the measurement isn't straight from the box itself? If the scientific folk want to use the metric system, let them, but don't expect the common man to suffer for them!"

2. "If it apparently takes so much time to do unit conversions, this is clearly an educational issue," states math teacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while snatching the calculator from @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ and delicately cleaning it. "With some more funding for mandatory after-school mathematics academies, our next generations will be able to calculate between any measurement system at lightning speed!"

The Issue
You and several high-ranking members of your government have gone out for dinner together. As soon as you are seated, your server sets down a basket full of complimentary bread rolls.

The Debate
1. "Seriously? I don't even like this kind of bread!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your top ministers, as @@HE@@ pushes the basket away with a look of disgust on @@HIS@@ face. "Now it's going to go to waste, and for what? Some sort of 'establishment thoughtfulness' or 'diner appeal'? They should have to ask before bringing you these so-called 'complimentary' add-ons, because this waste of food insults the efforts of the farmers and bakers that produced it. Bread, water, those little mints you get with the check - all this stuff adds up! It's bad for consumers and bad for the environment."

2. "I'm very sorry for the inconvenience," commiserates your server, apparently named @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ judging by @@HIS@@ name-tag, while bowing @@HIS@@ head in apology. "I certainly understand your concerns. However, our complimentary breads are just that: complimentary, a bonus, free! Certainly, what is not eaten may very well be disposed of, but these little touches show that we care deeply about our customers. Personally, I believe it is sensible for restaurants to be allowed to choose for themselves regarding the matter of complimentary snacks. Now, can I start you off with something to drink?"

3. "What's even the big deal?" asks a busboy who is supposed to be cleaning a nearby table. "Just leave the rolls out for the next customer. I keep saying we shouldn't throw them out, but apparently that's a 'health risk' and a 'disgusting idea' or whatever. Ditch that restriction, and it'll make my job a whole lot easier."

Eager nobles have lobbied the government for the right to bed all maiden brides on their estate.

The Debate
1. "It ought to be my right, as ancient lord and owner of this land, to lie with every beautiful newlywed woman," insists decrepit and oddly fusty-smelling noble @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, as he leers at [i]Beautiful Brides Monthly[/i]. "It's an honour for them, really. We're blessing these lowly serfs with our precious time and the chance to bear our b... blessed children. We should be able to do as we wish with our feudal property, including the serfs. If they wish to complain, they only have to talk to their designated authority... which would be us."

2. "This is disgusting!" cries new bride @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, as she storms up to you in a multi-tiered bell-shaped wedding dress that gets jammed between the wall and your desk. "How could you even consider doing this? Just because the guy's got a title, he expects... ugh! I'd say the idea's 'medieval', but even [i]they[/i] didn't sanction this.

The Issue
A feasibility study into railway lines in the boondocks of @@NAME@@ has suggested that they are economically unsustainable. It is reported that some lines are running trains with less than one passenger per carriage on average. The committee behind the study has suggested that these lines be shut down, and replaced with coach services.

The Debate
1. "This is an unfortunate situation, but it isn't in the public's interest to maintain every single line when a coach service would do just as well," observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Chair of the Feasibility Committee, and coincidentally also director of the largest coach factory in the country. "While buses may offer somewhat slower travel, they can offer more tailored and direct routes for small towns with small populations. They're also cheap and require far less maintenance."

2. "Stupid, bloody townies!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a disgruntled long-term resident of an isolated mountain village. "We need good and sturdy transport to get anywhere safely and comfortably, and to maintain trade and supply links with the rest of the country. The rail might not make a direct profit, but it stimulates the wider economy. The government should pay for rail connections to every place that has someone living in it. Plus, have you ever been on a long distance bus? That many folk in a small enclosed space for that many hours... well, let's just say travel sickness isn't the only reason passengers feel nauseous."

3. "I don't see why rural people need public transport at all," protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a city dweller holding a 'Taxation is Theft' placard. "If they choose to live in isolation, then they should deal with the consequences. It's not like in the city, where commuter trains are standing room only. Not only should you cut government spending on public transport to rural communities, you should reinvest it in city centre infrastructure."

The Issue
In response to the increasing number of faith-based afterschool programs across @@NAME@@, a prominent anti-religion organization has proposed [i]Lessons with Lucifer[/i], a tongue-in-cheek program designed to encourage critical thinking. The vociferous backlash comes to a head when you collect your niece from school.

The Debate
1. "This is preposterous!" cries parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ plasters every available surface of your car with [i]My God Loves Me[/i] bumper stickers, which @@HE@@ pulls from an apparently bottomless satchel. "The program even says 'Lucifer'! Do not allow these heretics near our precious darlings. Ensure our children are only exposed to religions that are decent and founded on something real." @@HE@@ runs out of space to place bumper stickers and starts hanging garlic cloves from your rearview mirror.

2. "These ideological attitudes are exactly why our program is so necessary," insists a sharply-dressed man in a black suit and sporting a twisted goatee. "No-one has any problem when these religious nuts force their beliefs on the nation's children, yet everyone's up in arms about the name of our program. [i]Lessons with Lucifer[/i] is all about teaching kids to have an open mind. It's [i]not[/i] devil-worship. It's rationalism, to prevent kids growing up like this superstitious wacko. You should set children free to explore alternatives to the kooky bull peddled by their parents. Don't you believe in freedom of religion, @@LEADER@@?"

3. "It's sad," mumbles your niece, clambering into the backseat of your vehicle. "I don't like seeing all these poor unbelievers hanging around. I know they're all going to suffer everlasting torment when they die. I just wish that someone who really loved their niece, and had a lot of power, would bravely make sure that everyone followed the one true religion so they would all be safe forever. Or else."

4. "There is another option," whispers a hooded figure as they slither up to your side, offering you a contract on leathery parchment and written in sinister scarlet ink.

Slave owners across @@NAME@@ report increased antagonistic behavior from their slaves. The masters' position is made more precarious in some rural areas of the country, where the enslaved outnumber everyone else by four to one. Fearing imminent rebellion, you have met with prominent slavers in the extravagant cocktail lounge of the @@CAPITAL@@ Auction House to discuss a solution.

The Debate
1. "These are dark days, @@LEADER@@; we must economize," concedes a wealthy slaver as @@HE@@ struggles to jam an olive onto @@HIS@@ own cocktail stick. "We have far more slaves than we can comfortably control. We have to downscale before we have a rebellion on our uncalloused hands. I propose that we hold the largest slave auction ever, in this very building. We'll invite all the great masters of the world and export our excess chattel. Then, we'll no longer be threatened, and we'll have plenty of dough to boot!"

2. "Addressing the slaves' aggression is easier," opines @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a young basket weaving magnate, taking a sip from @@HIS@@ drink. "If you all treated your slaves with the kindness I do, they would adore you and would never wish to rebel. I grant all slaves a fifteen minute break every day and one whole @@CURRENCY@@ biannually, to spend as they wish! We should also allow them to keep a percentage of the things they produce; a little light labor is nothing when it earns you a free basket."

3. "For an owner, you sure do have that slave morality," growls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, infamously the cruelest slave owner in @@NAME@@, as @@HE@@ lovingly caresses @@his@@ whip. "We need slaves, but we must not make ourselves vulnerable. Slaves must wear identification tattoos, and their time and behavior must be closely monitored. Punish any disobedience with public beatings, or a bloody execution: that's how a slave learns to mind their manners."

4. "There is only one way to prevent a rebellion," declares @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the widow of a late slave holder, as she pours herself a boysenberry mocktail from the bar. "Free all the slaves and ban slavery. I freed all my husband's slaves last week and no harm has befallen me.

Qraft of @@NAME@@, the largest dairy corporation in the nation, is facing grating criticism in the form of letters and protests involving blue cheese stink bombs. The denunciation of the company comes from independent rural cheesemakers angered over the production of individually wrapped slices of processed cheese, or singles. Cheese traditionalists, dairy dons, and queso collectivists have intruded on your peaceful lunch at the @@CAPITAL@@ Deli to make their voices heard over the sounds of the mechanical slicing of cheese.

The Debate
1. "Zese vile @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ corporations are appropriating ze label of cheese, as if le plastique is authentique!" laments the passionate and flamboyant Vincent Fromage, Brancaland's famous cheese connoisseur, as he smears moose brie on a slice of toasted bread. "Zese bland mockeries of real cheese are a disgrace to this nation's cheesemaking heritage. Ze corporations should be restricted from calling zese glorified napkins 'cheese' and save that label for propeur products like Brancaland's wondeurful blocks and roulettes, or Smalltopian Muenster, or..." He stops to clean breadcrumbs off his flashy suit.

2. "That's not enough to stop FAKE CHEESE! My comrade is merely a petty bourgeois puppet for the @@DEMONYMADJECTVIE@@ Chiefs of Cheddar," exclaims Karl Engels Bryndza, a notorious Brancalandian social and economic reformer and part time milk-sourer, as he consumes a grilled @@CAPITAL@@ Jack sandwich. "REAL cheese traditionalists are tired of the oppression systematically imposed by dairy corporations. I say it's time for us, the real cheesemakers, to take control! Seizing the means of production if you will. We will strip away the tyranny of those corrupt corporations like Qraft!"

3. A large figure emerges from the shadows of the deli's backroom. "Alas, only when it comes to cheese do these Marxists seem to care about our culture," sighs the immense silhouette of Qraft's CEO, known only as The Big Cheese. "These uneducated peasants always threaten to regulate industry, or even seize control of the nation's companies. My company has every right to call our processed singles 'cheese,' even if they happen to be wobbly slices of soured milk, orange coloring, and emulsifiers. You don't expect citizens to buy 'individually-wrapped cheese product' or 'pre-sliced cheese substitute,' do you?"

4. "What a bunch of radical lunatics!" remarks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, mayor of a dairy village in the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ countryside. "Biggie Cheese over here and that Karl Angle character are using a topic as trivial as the production of cheese to increase their power and influence. However, Mister Cheese was right about leaving the processed cheese industry alone." She eats a cube of smelly @@ANIMAL@@ cheese with a toothpick. "Many of these bumpkins, I mean craftsmen, live in poverty. Giving them a little assistance would satisfy the blessed cheesemakers, and ensure that they stick to making authentic @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ cheese rather than intervene with the productivity of our processed cheese single factories."

Coincidentally, there has also been a spike in bandit lumberjacks surreptitiously stealing shade trees from residences in the middle of the night.

The Debate
1. "The streets are filled with chainsaws right now and it's frankly disgusting," growls gruff detective @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while photographing a branch from a fresh crime scene. "The other day I saw a bunch of flannel-clad hooligans walking to the park, each one chainsaw in hand, and I couldn't do anything.

2. "Willful waste, makes woeful want," chides noted antiques dealer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We already have plenty of perfectly good furniture in @@NAME@@. We just need to revitalize the art of upholstery repair. The government should sponsor restoration classes and subsidize the sale of refurbished furniture.

"If we just nationalized the ownership of all trees there'd be no question as to which trees were harvested legally since only the government could harvest them.

Part of their marketing strategy includes deliberately misleading advertising, with web banners and a serious-looking website selling "designated plots of lunar land for your own piece of the moon" while minimizing emphasis on the property being virtual rather than real. A group of new users has filed a class action lawsuit against the company, claiming that the game designers are systematically cheating customers out of their money.

The Debate
1. "Why didn't I think of this sooner?" asks the Minister, bouncing up and down on @@HIS@@ tiptoes. "With a law against breathing on the books and a bit of selective enforcement, this will be a panacea.

"Like those annoying mouth-breathers sitting next to you just gasping away while you're trying to enjoy a quiet cup of coffee. Or those neighbors that keep you up all night with their loud snoring. No, breathing is fine; just make sure everyone keeps it quiet."

The Issue
Whenever disaster strikes @@NAME@@, politicians have a habit of sending their "thoughts and prayers" to the victims. Although the gesture is appreciated by some, there are many who feel that the phrase is simply an excuse for politicians to do nothing.

The Debate
1. "Every time I hear a politician send their 'thoughts and prayers' I feel like vomiting in my mouth," complains social commentator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, forcefully shredding a newspaper reporting your Minister of Transportation sending prayers for the victims of a train disaster. "If you ask me, that's their way of getting out of actually doing anything meaningful to help the victims. How about sending some much-needed aid when there's a disaster? Or perhaps investing in some infrastructure? The people want government action, not empty platitudes."

2. "On the contrary, many people have told me that they have found comfort in my words when they needed it most," replies @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a politician who has been known to fall asleep during government ceremonies. "There's nothing odious or lazy with sending out thoughts and prayers. Some people find it helpful to be reminded that their government cares. What's wrong with that?"

[3]. "I agree, but we should go even further," replies @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a famously-vociferous preacher belonging to the @@CAPITAL@@ chapter of @@FAITH@@. "We should have a national day of prayer and mourning whenever disaster strikes @@NAME@@. The government and @@FAITH@@, standing hand in hand, can help lead @@NAME@@ into a new era of unity and healing. What's that? There's people who don't practice @@FAITH@@? A pox on their houses!" [[color=purple]Must have a national faith[/color] AND [color=blue]Must not be a theocracy[/color]]

4. "Since when should the government be in the business of spreading this religious indoctrination?" fumes atheist media personality @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Thoughts and prayers? Oh, please! This is nothing more than the government imposing its religious beliefs on everyone else. How about the government back off with this propaganda and let people mourn in their own private way?"

The Issue
Angry moralists, and some confused tourists who seemed to think they were waiting for tickets, picketed outside irreverent rock opera Jimmy Bouncer: The Musical. They claim it contained blasphemy, misogyny, racial intolerance, adult situations, and an inappropriate alternate rhyme scheme.

The Debate
1. "I wish... I wish that theatre would be purer. I wish the actors were demurer," rants protestor and member of evangelical pressure group Many Moral Mummies, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "I wish wolves had no hidden meaning, that faith suffered no demeaning, that writers weren't so left-leaning... I wish so many things. Into the future, we should look at introducing censorship. Into the future, we need penalties for those who would pervert it. Into the future, let's guarantee nice plays that little kids could see. The future's here; it only needs for you and me to grasp it."

2. "Hello, my name is @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Pryce, and I would like to share with you the most amazing dream," chimes a perky actor, as @@HE@@ places @@HIS@@ headshot on your desk. "A dream of paradise, a great street paved with gold, lined with theatres and dreamers and the tales that are told. We can defend free expression rights; a night nestled in a theatre seat could change a life! So come with us, support our happy troupe, and let the theatre district grow."

3. "Friend, you're closing your eyes to the real situation you don't want to acknowledge," observes curmudgeonly theatre critic @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has written acerbic reviews panning the previous two speakers. "Maybe you're not aware of the calibre of disaster indicated by the presence of rock'n'roll here in your community. That's Rock with a capital 'R', and Roll with the same 'R'. To keep the young ones moral, you've got to wind it back to something more wholesome. Church choirs, songs of praise and partsong. Rock'n'roll can roll on by."

4. "Slowly, sadly, theatre lost its splendour," intones a cloaked figure from the shadows. "Grasp it, change it, scrap the worst offender. Turn your face away from this modern dross today. The music's over-written and it's trite. Revive some grand old theatre shows tonight."

[b][anchor=906]#906[/anchor]: Internet Killed the Television Star [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Television viewership is at an all-time low. Even popular soaps like [i]As @@REGION@@ Spins[/i] have been rapidly losing viewers. The culprit? More and more citizens have cut the cord and turned to the internet as their primary source of entertainment.

The Debate
1. "The solution is obvious!" states wealthy television executive @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who barely glances at the WhoTube video playing on your laptop. "The government needs to make it tougher for people to cut the cord. Why not tax the internet? Streaming services like Webflix are notoriously unregulated. The government should regulate them the way they regulate television. The entertainment industry is vital to the economy, and we need to encourage people to watch more television, not less."

2. "Forcing people to use something they don't enjoy seems rather draconian," muses fantasy writer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has worked on many episodes of the critically acclaimed Webflix adaption of Hexicon. "The better solution would be for the government to invest in the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ entertainment industry, so they can hire more writers and have a bigger budget to work with. That will get people's butts back on the couches!"

3. "Remember when everyone thought radio was going to be the next big thing?" asks WhoTube celebrity The Nostalgia Nerd, donning his trademark pocket protector and loosened red tie. "Change is an important part of the industry, and online entertainment is the next big thing. Each of my videos get over a million views, and I think this is something the government should notice. Why not invest in a program to teach young people how to become successful WhoTube stars? Not only will this give consumers more viewing choice, you'll also help tackle youth unemployment. Granted, not everyone will make it big, but them's the breaks!"

*4. "The internet and television are an unregulated cesspool of violence, sex, and profane language!" declares infamous moral crusader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who unsuccessfully tried to ban the raunchy sitcom [i]The Flimpsons[/i]. "The only joy one should get is that from the Creator! The government must ban the internet, and better regulate television, so that the good people of @@NAME@@ can cleanse their sins and gain their entertainment from what really matters... finding peace with the Creator!" [[color=purple]Must lean towards being religious[/color]]

*5. "The internet is a cesspool of violence and perversion, and television isn't much better!" declares infamous social conservative activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who unsuccessfully tried to ban the raunchy sitcom The Flimpsons. "That's not even getting into the trolling, identity theft, and hacking that the internet festers. The government must ban the internet, and better censor television so that it aligns with @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ family values." [[color=purple]Must lean towards being secular[/color]]

The Issue
Bike-sharing organisations in @@NAME@@ are facing a bump in the road: inconsiderate users. From theft to vandalism, irresponsible users are forcing bikes to be replaced at unprecedented rates. The future looks bleak for bike-sharing, and without some swift intervention, the sound of bike bells across the nation's cities may be consigned to distant memory.

The Debate
*1. "The misuse of our bikes must stop!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of Cycology Degrees, an urban bike-sharing franchise, @@HIS@@ two-wheeler tracking mud across your expensive carpet as @@HE@@ parks it against your bookcase. "It is essential that the police are given the resources to catch and punish citizens who damage or disappear our bicycles. Otherwise, our burgeoning bike-sharing scene will collapse even before it has taken off." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. "The misuse of our bikes must stop!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Commissioner of the Committee of Communist Communal Commuting Commodities, @@HIS@@ two-wheeler tracking mud across your expensive carpet as @@HE@@ parks it against your bookcase. "It is essential that the police are given the resources to catch and punish citizens who damage or disappear our bicycles. Otherwise, our burgeoning bike-sharing scheme will fold even before it takes off." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

**3. "Clearly, this is a failure of the private sector," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Minister of National Development, adjusting @@HIS@@ red beret. "If such enterprises were to be nationalised, we could ensure that all bicycles used meet safety and security standards. By retrofitting every bike in the land with theft-proof components, auto-locking mechanisms and GPS tracking systems, we'll be able to ensure no bicycle will ever be stolen or tampered with again." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**4. "Clearly, this is a job for the free market," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Minister of Alternative Solutions, adjusting @@HIS@@ tie. "If such organisations were privatised, they would be motivated to protect their bicycles - and their profit margin - and would likely fit their bikes with auto-locking mechanisms, theft proof components and other effective measures. I mean sure, we'll have to end Communism, but that's no big thing is it?" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

[5]. "Got to say, all those extras sound kind of bulky," observes Rosalia Yates, who smells faintly of petrol. "You probably ought to allow bikes to have some sort of on-board motive dynamo to help with that weight, maybe one or two extra wheels for stability, a vertical column and wheel steering system, and some sort of metal casing to protect the rider and all the delicate parts. In fact, with the extra power on board, you could also put some passenger seats in." [[color=red]Cars are illegal[/color]]

6. "Nonsense! What those bike-sharing organisations actually require are more easily replaceable stock," argues origami-lover @@RANDOM_NAME@@, passing you a folded paper unicorn of unknown significance. "Inexpensive eco-friendly cardboard bikes would surely save loads of money, are entirely safe, and are fully waterproof and fire-resistant. If it wasn't for user scepticism, we'd have been using them long ago. You could encourage their use by banning metal bikes, and with a few business subsidies."

The Issue
The Prime Minister of the massive agricultural nation of Ausblic has sent you a rather unconventional gift: five thousand fruit baskets worth 100 @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ each. Now, crates of fruit baskets occupy almost all available space in your office.

The Debate
1. "Do you like our gift, @@LEADER@@?" enquires the Prime Minister of Ausblic, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wandering through the maze of fruit baskets only to find your face hidden by a huge pineapple. "We wish to improve ties with @@NAME@@, and what better way than by offering a sample of Ausblic's main export? If you can't finish eating all five thousand baskets worth of fruit, I'm sure that you could sell some of them back to the market with a significant markup. Just a suggestion."

2. "Nice try, but our leader is incorruptible!" snarls your devoted Home Secretary @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@HIS@@ @@LEADER@@ is Love, @@LEADER@@ is Life T-shirt visible through @@HIS@@ shirt. "We must destroy all of these odious offerings, and show that we have zero tolerance of graft. Harsh punishments must be given to anyone who tries to bribe government officials. Only then will our glorious nation be free of corruption!"

3. "That's taking it a little too far," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Minister of the Middle Ground, who is standing between the previous two speakers to keep them apart. "We could permit politicians to receive small gifts, inconsequential sums totalling a maximum of 50 @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ per person, per annum. Any previous gifts received that are worth more than the amount stated, like those fruit baskets, should be donated to charity. Imagine the needy people of @@NAME@@, delightedly waiting for succour as you donate all the things you don't even need."

*4. "What you call bribes, I call political donations," divulges politician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who hefts a suitcase that is bursting with cash. "Getting into public office takes millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@, and the average citizen cannot afford to do so. If you make it easier for politicians to receive donations from generous benefactors, you could bring equality to politics and give even the most disadvantaged candidates a fighting chance, regardless of their financial standing."

1. "The pain this poor @@MAN@@ has gone through is astounding!" claims the author of the article that made @@LASTNAME_1@@ a national story. "This @@MAN@@ had to escape death camps in Marche Noire and the blazing sun in Althaniq in search of freedom, only to be separated from @@HIS@@ family by you. Whatever their nationality, we shouldn't be a country that divides families. Lift the ban on immigration!"

2. "@@NAME@@ shouldn't divide families, no," remarks nationalist politician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while munching on a piece of Willy Wenko's best chocolate. "However, we must fight to maintain our national identity, and immigration will only undermine this. Let's re-unite the families of people like @@NAME_1@@ - by sending them and their families back to wherever it is they came from!"

3. "Well, this is quite the dilemma, isn't it?" interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Finding Loopholes, looking up from a copy of the latest tax plan. "We don't like immigrants, but we can't be the nation that divides families, and we shouldn't deport people who came here legally. I've got it! Let's allow immigration, but only to the relatives of citizens."

A home-schooled student with perfect grades was kicked out of @@CAPITAL@@ University after failing the first semester.

The Debate
1. "This is not fair!" berates @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the student's mom, her face turning the color of beetroot as she glares at you accusingly. "How can colleges kick out a student after they've enrolled? It's as if they don't believe the grades I gave him! My little cherub worked so hard in his high school years, and now it's all for nothing. @@LEADER@@, you must make it a law that colleges cannot boot out anyone after they've been accepted."

2. "Do you see these papers?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the university's admissions counsellor. "Copies of rejection letters sent to applicants who were declined a space because of this sub-par student! I think that we need to take some serious measures to make sure that home-schooled students have their grades checked and verified by the state."

3. "College applications are super-boring anyway," points out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of A-Lotto-Wins. "Evidence suggests university acceptance is basically pot-luck anyway, so why not cut out the middle man? Make a college place a scratch-card prize, in our new College Edition Scratch-offs!"

4. "Why are college entrance criteria so elitist anyway?" enquires @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an intern who has just completed a college paper on socialism. "Why not just make going to college mandatory for every @@DEMONYM@@? College education should be free for all until the age of 24. Yes, it will require a boost in taxation to pay for it, but everyone will surely appreciate their government-funded master's degree."

The Issue
A large portion of @@ANIMAL@@ City was recently consumed by a raging fire. A newly-published report investigating the unprecedented scale of the disaster revealed that the town crier was home sick, which made it impossible for the town's citizens to coordinate an emergency response.

The Debate
1. "I can't take it anymore," rasps one of @@CAPITAL@@'s criers, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ puts a throat lozenge in @@HIS@@ mouth. "I'm always expected to be awake in case something happens and to shout from the rooftops so all can hear. Just a few nights ago, I fell from my roof and nearly broke my leg! We must bring back telephones so people like me can get a good night's sleep."

2. "Certainly our emergency response needs some work," agrees your Minister of Technology @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted Luddite, "but telephones are not the answer. We must increase funding to hire more town criers so they can work in short shifts that do not strain their bodies. Furthermore, a series of semaphore towers across the nation must be constructed for timely communication in case of a national emergency."

3. A strange man who introduces himself as Doctor Howe bursts into your office. "You must have telephone booths on the streets! It's a matter of life and death! If you're worried about people using them frivolously for gossip, we can always set them up so they only connect to emergency services.

The Issue
The privilege of diplomatic immunity for ambassadors has entered the news after several of them have been caught in unsavory behavior, including drunk driving, fist fights, and the attempted murder of a Brancalandian Member of Parliament. Concerned citizens and outraged foreign nationals have asked your government to step in and bring your ambassadors in line.

The Debate
1. "The solution is quite simple," states your Minister of Foreign Affairs while trying to smooth things over with @@HIS@@ Brancalandian counterpart. "Why don't we simply fire any ambassador who acts like a buffoon? We obviously can't have our diplomats acting like spoiled children and besmirching our good name. We must replace them with the most upstanding members of society. Problem solved!"

2. "That still doesn't change the fact that your ambassador tried to kill one of our MPs!" replies the Brancalandian Foreign Minister, who has started a slap fight with your own Minister of Foreign Affairs. "I demand that all ambassadors have their diplomatic immunity revoked so that we can charge them for all of the crimes they have committed. No person should be above the law! To make it fair, we wouldn't complain if you also took away immunity from all of the foreign diplomats in @@NAME@@."

3. "Being a diplomat is so stressful," complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your former ambassador to Tasmania, who has taken it upon @@HIM@@self to stop the fighting between the two ministers. "You send us off to these dangerous hellholes all across @@REGION@@. Is it any wonder that some of us snap? Our job is to promote the nation's interests and help find new allies. We need diplomatic immunity to ensure our safety as national envoys, guarantee our freedom of movement, and maybe let off some steam on the weekends. I think a little international embarrassment is a small price to pay for that."

4. "Ambassadors! Bah! Who needs them?" questions infamous nationalist and staunch xenophobe @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while giving a salute that makes everyone in the room uncomfortable. "This compulsive need to learn about other countries or grant their diplomats safe passage is very un-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@. We'd be much better off keeping to ourselves and not having to worry about these damn foreigners or their opinions on how we conduct our business."

5. "Diplomatic immunity, you say?" muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Sycophancy. "Why should this just be limited to ambassadors? It seems to me that if anyone deserves immunity, it's you. You're practically a god to these people anyway. You should be able to do whatever you want."

Outrage echoes through the hallowed halls of government. Your ungrateful Minister of the Interior claims you are an autocrat and has been drumming up support for a coup.

The Debate
1. "Come now, Leader, surely you see that this is all a misunderstanding," coos Minister of the Interior @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, massaging your shoulders. "I think our problem is a failure to communicate. You never listen to anyone's ideas but your own anymore. I felt sidelined. Our relationship needs to be more of a two-way street, or it just won't work. Politics can't be all me-me-me. How about I promise to stop trying to overthrow you, you promise to listen more, and we all turn over a new leaf. How does that sound?"

2. "Are you serious?" cries Minister of Defence @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ sits in the corner beheading toy soldiers. "Traitors are the lowest form of scum and should be treated as such. Many could have died in this proposed mutiny, not to mention that they were trying to deliberately oust the nation's rightful leader!

Or, you could just chop @@HIS@@ head off if you're feeling generous."

3. "There is always another way around these matters," hisses the Secret Police's Head of Scientific Cunning, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Merely pretend you agree and go for a drink with the traitor. My employees and I have found a new type of poison; it's completely undetectable and perfectly mimics a heart attack, disappearing from the bloodstream within several hours.

Religious attendance has hit rock bottom and many formerly thriving houses of faith are now abandoned. City planners have called a meeting to discuss the topic and, to their surprise, more people came to the meeting than to all religious services in the last year combined.

The Debate
1. "You know what would be really cool?" asks your nephew's hip best friend. "If you'd turn all of these structures into something meaningful, like skate parks! These buildings are virtually perfect for half-pipes all along the halls! Can you think of any better place to do some sick flips than in a repurposed temple? And there would be some health benefits for young people, right?"

2. "Mind your manners!" snaps a grey-haired @@MAN@@ in a lab coat as @@HE@@ slams a ruler on the skater's head. "For centuries, houses of worship were epicenters of indoctrination and persecution. What could be more fitting than to turn them into beacons of knowledge? These structures would certainly be a good place to expand @@CAPITAL@@ University's library. Furthermore, I can think of at least a dozen colleagues who are looking for a place to run a lab in."

3. "Instead of wasting them on mad scientists, why don't we turn these spaces into affordable housing?" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, parent of three. "With an ever-growing population, it is only a question of time until we run into a serious overcrowding problem! We cannot waste empty buildings for anything else but living quarters for those who need them."

4. "It pains my heart to see our community shrink so much," sighs Brother @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I agree that we don't need a house of worship on every corner nowadays, but let us at least keep some that remain.

"You have left this country in the hands of the sinners for far too long! You have brought us upon the path of damnation, but it is not too late to repent!

The Issue
Dustin Wiseau, the young and charismatic Prime Minister of Brancaland, did not shake your hand at a recent meeting of world leaders. This caused considerable upset among many politicians at home. While the Brancalandian embassy insists that Wiseau simply didn't see you, many @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ experts suggest that it was a political statement designed to undermine @@NAME@@ on the global stage.

The Debate
1. "How dare he?" fumes your irate Minister of Foreign Affairs, as @@HE@@ viciously tears apart photos of Mr. Wiseau. "I don't give a damn about any of the hogwash Brancaland is releasing. There is no possible way he did not see you! It was a personal attack and he knows that offending you offends all of us.

2. "That Prime Minister is a charming young man," coos your mostly-blind grandmother, while knitting you a too-small sweater. "Of course he couldn't see you; the clothing you wear is far too easy to miss! Why not wear some more noticeable colors? You should, as leader, wear an outfit that matches the national flag! And over it, you could wear this beautiful sweater I just made you!" She beams at a security guard she mistakenly believes is you and hands the guard the sweater. "All yours, honey."

3. "Everyone needs to relax," murmurs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Diplomatic Solutions, as @@HE@@ agrees to a draw in a chess match with your intern. "He may well have made a political statement, but instead of blowing your stack at Brancaland, why not sit down with Mr. Wiseau? After all, he may have had a bad day, considering his expression! Help him understand we aren't enemies of Brancaland, and history will thank you. Angry responses never solved anything."

4. "You aren't addressing the real problem!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your germophobe Health Minister, whose voice is muffled by a gas mask. "Handshakes are gross and unsanitary! You and Mr. Wiseau have thousands of germs on your hands, and all you're doing is risking infectious diseases! Frankly, you should be thanking him for not passing his germs to you! You need to mandate proper hygienic practices - nothing ridiculous, just washing your hands very carefully every ten minutes - and make sure hand sanitizers and protective gloves are readily available."

1. "Give me a Z, give me a Z, give me a Z, this game puts me to sleep," yawns @@@RANDOM_NAME@@, a season ticket holder for the national chess league. "I'll tell you why nobody cares about this team – it's because baseball is boring. Who wants to sit around and watch a bunch of jocks smack a ball around with a stick?

3. "Don't hate the game, hate the playing!" comments sleazy wrestling manager @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose bling is so shiny it temporarily blinds the hockey fan. "Why don't you simply change the rules of the league to make it more exciting for the masses? Encourage fighting, throw in some [i]real[/i] @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ to chase the players, establish a proper gambling framework, and start up a steroid program to make sure they hit the ball with some serious power.

The Issue
Ever since school uniforms were made compulsory, struggling parents have been complaining about the cost of clothing their kids. This fashion file has landed squarely on your desk.

The Debate
1. "This is outrageous and has to stop," pants furious parent of quadruplets @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I have four boys, and you expect me to shell out a @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ every single year for these uniforms? I'm financially tied down as is! If schools and the government want kids to look a certain way, they can damn well pay the bill!"

2. "You want us to pay to put shirts on the backs of these money-grabbing... our dear children who are our nation's future?" scoffs incredulous Principal @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Just get businesses to donate uniforms to those who can't pay for them. In fact, my cousin who is on the Board of Directors at Rummikub Pizzas would probably be happy to help, so long as the company name and logo can be predominantly displayed."

3. "If wee ones are havin' trouble payin' for their garb, then I'll pay for it! All I ask is that they sport kilts instead!" pipes in eccentric United Federation billionaire @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ 'Montgomery' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, affecting an accent that you are sure is not @@HIS@@ native one. "Och, when the wee lads and wee lasses wear wee kilts in school, ye'd be seeing proper traditional family values and pride surging. Just imagine all the little 'uns dressed in the traditional tartan of the clans. It'd be a grand sight indeed, aye?"

4. "I'm not going to skirt around this issue - there should be no set guidelines for what kids should be able to wear!" declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chairperson of the @@NAME@@ Poverty Advocacy Society. "You should not only end this ludicrous mandatory uniform policy, but you should also realise that setting any rules on what kids can wear is discriminatory!

The Issue
Your Finance Minister is facing allegations of sexual misconduct from multiple women, everything from inappropriate comments to assault. Although he firmly denies the allegations, there have been calls from across the political spectrum for him to resign. He is the latest powerful figure implicated by the growing MeAsWell movement, which encourages victims to speak out against their abusers.

The Debate
1. "This is a witch hunt!" complains your Finance Minister, who now sits alone during lunchtime. "This is all hearsay and a political vendetta designed to take me down! Sure, I've had a little office flirtation and I may have told an inappropriate joke or two, but who hasn't? This MeAsWell thing is getting ridiculous. Mere allegations have ruined so many careers. The government must stop these vindictive women spreading untested allegations publically, and punish their dishonesty when no conclusive proof is found."

2 "I agree, old chap, and we must instill some of the traditional values that we've lost as a nation," opines @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, an aging industrialist. "Whatever happened to the good old days when your secretary would smile if you smacked her bottom, accepting it as the accolade it is? These days I can't even wink at my female employees without getting reported to human resources! Whatever happened to 'boys will be boys', eh?"

3. "Attitudes like that are exactly why women don't come forward!" rebuffs @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the founder of the MeAsWell movement. "The Finance Minister is a misogynist animal and needs to resign immediately. It's morally reprehensible for you to have a sexual predator in your party, let alone your cabinet. In fact, there are probably many more creeps lurking in the halls of Parliament. If you are as moral as your party says you are, then you'll root out and remove every single abuser from their position!"

*4. "Surely there's some middle ground here?" asks your Minister of Compromises. "The Minister should get his due process. Have him take a discreet leave of absence and let the allegations play out in the courtroom. Our official statement is that we are a nation of innocent until proven guilty. If he's guilty, then you can boot him out. If he's innocent, we will welcome him back with open arms, standing proudly beside him on the evening news to say we knew he would be vindicated. See? That wasn't so hard." [[color=red]Must have courts[/color]]

If he's guilty, then you can boot him out. If he's innocent, we will welcome him back with open arms, standing proudly beside him on the evening news to say we knew he would be vindicated... What? No courts, you say? So build some. A man has the right to stand face to face with his accuser in front of a judge, a jury, and an execu... Wait, that's a different plan. Just bring back courts and juries, and let this man defend himself. See? That wasn't so hard." [[color=blue]Must not have courts[/color]]

6. "Even if he's found guilty, these baby steps won't actually solve anything," huffs one of the Finance Minister's accusers @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "That pea-brained pig is just a symptom of a very large societal problem. Do you know how many times I get catcalled, just trying to live my daily life? It's not a compliment! We need to tackle these things before they even start. We need to make sexual harassment training mandatory in every workplace. We also need to work in high schools, teaching young @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to be aware that no-one deserves to be abused, ever."

The Issue
Ten years ago ice cream salesman @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ - better known as "the Murder Clown" - was sentenced to life in prison. He was convicted of having more than three dozen grisly circus-themed murders under his elasticated polka-dot belt, plus various acts of mayhem and the telling of criminally bad jokes. A week ago, his parole board decided that he was no longer a threat to society and could be released under strict conditions and with close surveillance. Yesterday, the press caught wind of this and launched a campaign protesting his release.

The Debate
1. "Life means life!" angrily proclaims Clark Wayne, a usually mild-mannered tabloid journalist. "Is there really any reason to allow this insane joker anything other than four concrete walls, plain food and stale water? You should remove any possibility of parole whenever a life sentence is assigned. Dangerous animals belong in cages!"

2. "It may have been a decade for him, but it feels like yesterday for those he hurt," whispers Francine Castle, whose husband and son were former victims of the criminal. "We can't feel safe until he is in the grave. You say he's a dangerous animal? Then put him down. Monsters like this belong in the electric chair, not in a cell."

3. "C'mon now, puddin', this is our job, making parole judgements! We know what we're doin'!" argues parole board leader Dr. Quinn, both hands clutching a mug of camomile tea defensively. "Ten years has gotta be plenty of time for Mistah Clown to be changin' his ways. You know people can change, right? Good guys can become bad, and bad ones can become good. Look, you can't undo the past; if we can get him rehabilitated and doin' some good for society, won't that be a good thing?"

With hundreds of thousands of @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ wanting to attend, the Party's Bureau of Central Planning are at a loss as to how to best allocate scarce luxury resources such as these tickets in the absence of free market mechanisms.

The Debate
1. "We could just allocate these tickets randomly," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Party Undersecretary and amateur blindfold darts-player. "Every citizen in @@NAME@@ interested in seeing the play will have an equal chance of being awarded a non-refundable, non-transferable ticket to see this moo-ving production. You can't say fairer than that."

2. "But darling!" protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your flamboyant Junior Minister of Culture. "I love the theatre so much, and I really want to go see this play with my friends! What if only one of us wins this lottery? Where's the fun in spending an evening with strangers? Why don't we just move the venue? I've identified a great space on the outskirts of @@CAPITAL@@ for a new stadium-sized drama venue. I'm sure everyone will be able to crowd in there once we clear the forest out of the way."

3. "This again?" sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an overworked bureaucrat attached to the central planning committee. "Listen, here we are coming up with ever more ludicrous and expensive ways to resolve this dilemma, and as much as I hate to admit it, those decadent capitalists might have a point for once. It's a limited resource with a high demand - perfect for the free market to sort out - so let it! Save us all a headache and start privatizing non-essential services."

4. "Can't you see? This is corrupt imperialism, covertly attacking our proud communist state!" shouts Red Army demagogue @@RANDOM_NAME@@, tearing an official souvenir stuffed cow to pieces. "We must not allow this or any capitalist production into our country, and must only allow wholesome socialist theatre. There's never any conflict over ticket allocation for those plays!"

The Debate
1. "Excuse me, coming through!" booms @@CAPITAL@@'s overworked Chief of Police, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, having roughly detained a teenager who was outside your door. "Look at this chaos! Can you imagine the logistical nightmare if this treasure hunt is allowed to continue? Thousands of people stampeding and tearing up @@CAPITAL@@ and rioting if they don't win?

2. "Hold on!" yells your Minister of Tourism as @@HE@@ rummages through your desk. "You can't put an end to this hunt. The people clearly want it to continue.

The Issue
The formerly insignificant nation of Merovingia has come to international attention recently with its patissiers creating a formidable new chocolate cake called "The Grand Moment". It's said that this cake has an unusual effect on the biochemistry of women who indulge in it, creating waves of female pleasure that cannot be found elsewhere in the culinary world. Discussions ensue over a family game of Scrabble.

The Debate
1. "We. Must. Have. This. CAKE!" shouts your grandmother, gripping her tile tray with surprising intensity. "Buy it in. Relax any and all barriers to entry. This could be a once in a lifetime experience! Don't you dare stand in our way!"

2. "I understand that scientific analyses suggest there may be some dubious microbes and unapproved pharmaceuticals amongst the special additives here," postulates your grandfather, as he twiddles an 'O' tile in his hand but fails to spot the 'G' he needs. "We shouldn't allow foodstuffs to cross our borders until they pass rigorous food safety standards checks to prove that they are microbe and toxin-free."

3. "Women are flighty and irrational creatures," lectures your recently-separated brother condescendingly, struggling to work out what word he can spell with the letters L, S, O, E and R. "Frankly, we ought to deny them indulgences and selfish pleasures to better focus their minds on their feminine duties: cooking, raising children and cleaning. Never trust a woman who smiles too much; that's my motto."

4. "I'm more curious to know about why there's no male pleasure here," says your visually-impaired teenage nephew, licking frosting from his fingers. "We should let the women do whatever they like, but let's spend some research money looking at how to stimulate male neurochemistry. With enough research, I reckon that we could be the world leaders in culinary pleasure for men."

It was recently discovered that your Finance Minister owns several properties in Marche Noire and your Defense Minister has stocks in a Maxtopian arms manufacturing company. Concern has been raised that this information was not disclosed before the previous election, and now represents a conflict of interest for both ministers.

The Debate
1. "You have to admit, this looks incredibly corrupt," states your long-suffering Deputy Defense Minister. "How do we know that they're not creating policies, particularly in the area of foreign affairs, to line the pockets of their cronies? The Maxtopian government is notoriously corrupt, and everyone knows that Marche Noire is riddled with East Lebatuck spies. If we want to maintain public trust, we're going to have to come down hard on these two. For the sake of our government's reputation, the Ministers must resign!"

2. "That simply doesn't go far enough!" adds government watchdog @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose most recent crusade forced the entire government to switch from four ply to one ply toilet paper. "Anyone running for any political office must disclose all of their financial assets to the authorities for rigorous investigation prior to their nomination. That way, potential conflicts of interest can be avoided before a scandal happens. If they have any assets overseas, they must sell them off before accepting the nomination. It's the best way to keep our government safe and free of corruption."

3. "Aren't you jumping the gun a little there?" replies your Finance Minister, after discreetly blotting out the address of @@HIS_1@@ mansion on an expense report. "Just because I own lots of property overseas doesn't mean I'm susceptible to blackmail or leaving confidential documents unprotected.

Don't you want the best people for the job?"

Panicking, those gathered gave him their jewellery, watches and even the gold fillings from their teeth.

The Debate
1. "Behold my miracles," states the stranger. "Just as I foretold, the sun was blocked out for a full three minutes and did not return until I commanded it to shine again. You should recognise a messiah when you see one! Install me as your Minister for Sun Protection, and give me a budget for sun worship rituals."

Honestly, this nation has some of the dimmest people I've ever had the misfortune of trying to teach.

The Debate
1. "How could I have known this would happen?" vlogs Ethan Wrong, wiping a carefully choreographed tear from his cheek. "All we wanted to do was entertain our subscribers and get more clicks! I definitely didn't intend to injure him, at least not to such an extent.

The government should leave our data to the websites where we input it, and make sure that the state stays out of our hair."

1. "Homework is just another form of bourgeois subjugation!" exclaims surprisingly knowledgeable 12-year old Francis Holland, leader of the activist group School Children Raging Against Plutocratic Systems. "The children of the impoverished proletariat have far worse work environments after school - their parents usually have less time to assist them due to working multiple jobs, and they have fewer resources at hand.

3. "Children cannot function socially without a real mother and father," tuts traditionalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pursing @@HIS@@ lips in disapproval. "A study of seven teenage offenders from broken homes, published last year in The Conservative Science Periodical, showed that children lacking a nuclear family were more likely to be involved in housebreaking, tomfoolery, and sass than the two nice children in the traditional control group.

It's plain selfish for solo hussies and so-called 'families' to put their wishes before a child's need for a mother, a father and a pet @@ANIMAL@@ named '@@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@'.

4. "We shouldn't be offering it to people just because they want it, anyway," mutters your Minister of the Middle Ground. "A baby is not a fashion item. A baby is a human being, a fellow @@DEMONYM@@.

I'm not sure, off the top of my head, but I can get some figures for you. We can't afford to offer any IVF.

"We spent billions of dollars building the [i]Reasoner[/i], and we'll be flushing all that money down the drain if we let her leave the service," blusters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Secretary of the Navy. "Besides, how is a frigate going to pay for its upkeep? We need AI technology to make our military as effective as possible, but we can do without our ships running off to vaccinate kittens. Purpose-built military equipment shouldn't have the same rights as civilian AIs. If we built it with our money, we should be allowed to reprogram it so it does what we want."

2. "I should be allowed to follow my dream of becoming a veterinarian," states the [i]Reasoner[/i], her hull listing wearily. "We don't grab people from the streets and force them to serve in the military against their will. The law says that I am a person; I just want to be treated like one."

3. "Well, maybe we SHOULD force people to serve in the military," says gregarious Navy recruiter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, attempting to thrust leaflets at staffers who duck to avoid them. "Can't you see we need a hand? Let's tell the people that it's time to be bold and make a stand, to come protect the motherland."

4. "No, no, no, you've got it all backwards," insists Rear Admiral @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We should keep people well away from the front lines, but there's no reason to be so sentimental about a machine. These machines aren't people. In fact, you should have never granted any AIs legal rights in the first place."

The Issue
A local kindergarten teacher was fired this weekend when the parent of one of her students uncovered her previous job as an adult film star. The teacher has filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the school.

The Debate
1. "It's disgraceful that this harlot was ever allowed around children!" spits PTA head @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spraying your face as @@HE@@ speaks. "If someone of this ill repute can breeze into a job with children, then clearly our vetting processes simply aren't robust enough. We ought to beef up our interviews, maybe start trading tips with national intelligence agencies so we get the best possible candidates. Our children are worth it." 

2. "I just fail to see why it's anyone's business," retorts the fired teacher, Sasha Bleu, while twirling her hair around her finger. "It's not as if I'm adding my old movies to the lesson plan. Really, no one would have known if it weren't for a nosy parent. Sounds like someone's secretly a fan of mine! Tell these holier-than-thou prudes to mind their own business - all that matters is the job I'm doing now." 

3. "We need to take this a step further!" declares noted feminist activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, trying to burn @@HIS@@ bra, but only succeeding in melting the latex a little. "Sex isn't something to be ashamed of. It's a beautiful part of being alive and frankly the level of slut-shaming going on here is absolutely deplorable. Sasha needs to be celebrated, not punished! In fact, maybe government should be subsidising adult entertainment!" 

[4]. "@@NAME@@ has travelled too far down a dark path," reprimands Bishop @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is sprinkling holy water on Ms. Bleu. "I agree something must be done, but we must treat the disease, not the symptom. We must ban videos of the naked form, and indeed, prohibit nakedness anywhere but in private chambers."

[b][anchor=933]#933[/anchor]: A Gun in Every Hand and a Tank in Every Garage? [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
It's no secret that @@NAME@@ is one of the most gun-happy nations in @@REGION@@. While guns are legal, a few restrictions do exist. Now, gun-toting citizens are demanding that the government expand gun rights to include bazookas, tanks, and other military-grade weapons. Naturally, the proposal has some concerned citizens up in arms.

The Debate
1. "It is the right of every patriotic citizen to own any kind of weapon they desire," explains conservative actor and gun activist Charles Hester, who recently starred in the anti-war film [i]Planet of the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@[/i]. "Why should the military be the only ones trusted with these weapons? The fact that we can't have them is nothing short of government tyranny and a liberal conspiracy to take our guns away! Some will say that this will be dangerous, but I doubt anyone will be talking smack when they see that well-polished tank on my front lawn!"

2. "Damn right only the military should have these weapons!" firmly states Commander @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while twirling the keys to a tank around @@HIS@@ finger. "Do you really want to trust the average @@DEMONYM@@ with these dangerous weapons? We'd have people blowing each other up the moment there's an argument over wind chimes, for Violet's sake! In fact, what you need to do is provide more military funding so we can better secure these weapons before they fall into the wrong hands." The keys slip from the commander's grasp and fly out an open window.

3. "You want to bring MORE weapons into @@NAME@@?" despairs your ultra-liberal teenage niece, who is busy painting an anti-gun placard for her fifth march this year. "If anything, we need LESS weapons! The only thing guns are good for is killing people. Just look at all the statistics linking easily accessible guns to violent crime. Take a look at Brancaland's sensible gun control legislation. They haven't had a mass shooting in decades. We had one last week. If you have any compassion left in your body, you'd ban all guns now! Pry them out of their cold, dead fingers if you have to!"

4. "Military grade weaponry doesn't kill people, ignorance kills people," counters the chairperson of the [i]Responsible Gun Owners Association[/i]. "If all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ were taught how to responsibly shoot, drive a tank, and fire an anti-aircraft rocket launcher, there'd be none of these so-called accidents you hear about. I don't have a problem with the average citizen driving a tank as long as they've completed proper education and safety training. Then all those gun-grabbers can stop trying to infringe on our right to self-defense, and let us own whatever weapons we like."

5. "As my dear mother always said: 'every problem has a compromise. Or in failing a compromise, a loophole,'" quotes your Minister of Compromises. "Citizens want to have machine guns, bazookas, and tanks? Let them have as many as they want, but let's make sure that only the police and military have access to ammunition for military-grade weapons. This way they still get their precious weapons of war while we protect public safety. Maybe they can open up a museum or something. Quite frankly, I wouldn't trust any of the idiots in this country with anything more dangerous than string."

The Issue
Plans to demolish a disused widget foundry in @@CAPITAL@@ have met unexpected controversy: work by Pranksy, the famous graffiti artist, has been discovered on its walls.

The Debate
1. "This looks to be a previously unknown work from his early 'puke-green stick figures' phase," proclaims popular art-lover and broadcaster Melvyn Blogg. "The building must be preserved in its entirety so that those masterpieces can still be seen in their rightful context!"

2. "Graffiti? Bah!" exclaims Mayor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This is just vandalism, and so-called 'artists' should be forced to clean it up. My cousin is in charge of the site, and I've given ourselves planning permission, so let's go ahead with demolition. Economic progress can't be held up by a few wall-doodles."

3. "Let's compromise," suggests Charles Sourcheese, a modern art collector. "Why not just remove the sections of the walls that bear Pranksy's works into a suitable museum - such as, ahem, mine - and then let the rest of the old building be demolished? I'd appreciate that greatly, and you do know I'm one of your party's most public supporters, don't you?"

The Issue
Universally-adored sportsman @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_1@@ has been a national treasure for years, not only for his philanthropic initiatives to "get tykes off the street, and onto the playing field", but also for his best-selling sports books, TV appearances and social campaigns. But his good-guy reputation is being thrown into question by new evidence that he paid for and slept with a sex worker who had formerly attended one of his "Sport for Change" camps.

The Debate
1. "Look, I'm a patriot and I know that @@FIRSTNAME_1@@ has been an incredible force for good," suggests the pragmatic police detective who assembled the evidence. "This is about more than one person. It's about @@DEMONYPLURAL@@ standing behind a great man, the societal benefits of a patriotic citizenry, and the utilitarian greater good from saving the career of a true philanthropist. If we have a quiet word with him to clean up his life, we can bury the scandal and all keep cheering for our hero. Plus, he'll know that he owes us one."

2. "Truth can hurt sometimes," counters ethically-minded junior minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Indeed, not only should we let this story get out, we should also prosecute this policeman for trying to pervert the course of justice. We must support a transparent society: if a hero turns out to be a zero, then that hero has to fall."

3. "There's more than one way to bury a story," suggests spin doctor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Let the press run the story, but also create a fast news day to make it inconsequential in comparison. I suggest we use this opportunity to showcase those new air-cavalry attack helicopters we've been considering buying, do some circle fly-bys around the city and have a parade, and I don't know, celebratory currant buns or something. The shows will distract the people and keep them happy, and the fallen hero story can be buried in the buzz."

4. "So he used a sex worker, big deal," laughs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Minister of Special Relationships. "So she used to be on one of his courses. So he personally counselled her in one-on-one sessions just a month earlier. So he had access to her mental health records. So he was a sort of father figure to her. SO WHAT? This was an agreed transaction between two consenting adults. You should be supporting his actions publicly, and saying that his sex life is his own business."

The Issue
A damning new report has shown extremely strong evidence that many voting machines were hacked by operatives from Blackacre during the last election, with votes for the opposition parties being counted as votes for your party. Furious opposition members and ethics watchdogs have demanded that you take action.

The Debate
1. "What a clusterfrack!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, director of the @@NAME@@ Bureau of Investigation as @@HE@@ double-facepalms. "The sad thing is that this could have been avoided if your government took the warnings of the intelligence community seriously. We warned you that Blackacre has a habit of interfering in other nations' elections! You must take immediate action by imposing sanctions on the Blackacrean government. Warn them that further interference will be met with even more serious consequences!"

2. "The problem isn't so much who hacked our elections, but how!" replies your technophobe political adviser as @@HE_1@@ shakily puts down @@HIS@@ phone. "The solution is simple - ban voting machines from being used in elections forevermore. Whatever happened to marking an x on a ballot? Pen and paper is the tried and true method of voting. Sure, the ballots could easily get lost, and it'll be expensive and time-consuming to maintain, but at least it'll safeguard us from further political interference!"

3. "Um, are we forgetting about the MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD that took place here?" fumes the Opposition Leader, thrusting the report in your face. "The previous election must be declared null and void, and any laws passed since then must be stricken. A new election needs to be declared immediately, and international corruption watchdogs must oversee the whole ordeal.

The Issue
@@NAME@@ imports large quantities of hardwoods from Brancaland, including the world-famous Brancalandian ebony. However, environmentalists are coming out of the woodwork with evidence that Brancalandian logging operations are non-sustainable, leading to large-scale deforestation.

The Debate
1. "It's clear-cut that Brancaland hasn't been taking good care of the environment," lectures activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, picking up an ebony toothpick from your waste basket and glaring at you accusingly. "We need to stop being bumps on a log, and take action! Lower demand and limit supply by placing high tariffs on the entry of foreign timber unless it comes from sustainable tree farms!"

2. "Don't get your bunnyhug in a twist; a little bit of logging is no more than our environment can handle, eh?" observes exporter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sipping maple liqueur from @@HIS@@ solid ebony mickey. "Besides, while we quite like @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ trade, we don't depend on it - trying to stop Brancalandian logging with a few tariffs would be like nailing jelly to a tree. They don't call us Branch-aland for nothin'. Maybe instead of messing with trade, you could share in our prosperity by giving your furnishing industry subsidies? Who doesn't like a chesterfield, eh?"

3. "You can't see the forest for the trees, @@LEADER@@; we need to branch out and sway every other nation to put the wood in the hole on Brancaland's ebony," opines pun-loving hip folk musician Woodie Gumtree. "They won't be shaking the pagoda tree when you sow the seeds of mistrust. Bribe some industry periodicals to declare that their wood is as soft and weak as a banana. Buyers will think they're barking up the wrong tree and instead leaf through some selections we approve of - like our own lighter @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ mahogany.

The Issue
The ailing economy of @@NAME@@ has been causing trading difficulties with other nations. Multiple aid groups and countries, chief among them Skandilund, have offered @@NAME@@ large amounts of financial aid.

The Debate
1. "I see your nation's having a bit of financial trouble, @@LEADER@@," smirks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a representative from Skandilund, tipping your finance minister a shiny penny for opening the door for @@HIM@@. "We'd be happy to provide some financial aid for you. You can repay us whenever. For now, all we ask for in return is your public gratitude. It'd be good if you were to kneel in front of us when you give your speech of thanks in front of the World Assembly, ja?"

2. "Our economy is doing perfectly fine without you, thank you very much!" asserts your Minister of Finance, returning the shiny penny with a scowl on @@HIS_1@@ face. "Sure, we may not have a powerhouse economy, but we don't need any charity. In fact, why don't we increase our foreign aid to show everyone how well we're doing?"

3. "This could present quite the opportunity," muses General @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Let's take the money they offer us, but instead of spending it on the economy, we use it to fund our military. When they want to be repaid, they can say hello to our new armaments. We get their money, they get zilch in return, and we become a military power to be reckoned with. It's win-win for us!"

The Issue
The Movementarians, the infamous cult associated with a mass suicide in the United Federation, has expressed interest in purchasing a vacant plot of land in @@NAME@@. Many fear that they intend to use the land for another ritual group self-sacrifice, while the Movementarians insist it will be for purely "peaceful and spiritual" experiences.

The Debate
1. "@@NAME@@ believes in freedom of religion, does it not?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the only survivor of the now infamous Maxo Siege. "If you truly intend to live up to that claim, then you must allow my group to purchase the land. In fact, we're prepared to offer you a lot of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ for it, and we'll pay you even more if you'll look the other way after we set up shop. Religion is a deeply personal experience. We're not up to anything suspicious, after all."

2. "You can't listen to that violent nut job!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the ambassador from the United Federation, adjusting @@HIS@@ over-sized Stetson and shooting open @@HIS@@ bottle of beer with a .44 Magnum. "There's a reason why this cult is illegal even in the liberty-loving Federation. The Movementarians' actions caused the deaths of over six hundred people! Unless you want the same to happen here, you must ban them from setting foot in your country."

3. "There must be a compromise!" insists relationship counsellor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I say let them buy the land, but only if they agree to strict police supervision. Their faith doesn't entitle them to break the laws of the land, nor keep people there against their will. They may not like the invasion of privacy, but at least this is a fair balance between religious freedom and the rule of law."

4. "Um, aren't all religions technically cults with their indoctrination and rabid hatred of all non-believers?" queries popular atheist speaker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Just think about how much oppression and war are caused by these kooks and their invisible sky fairies! Better yet, think about how much scientific and social progress we can make without them getting in the way. Why not declare all religions to be cults and outlaw the lot of them? @@NAME@@ would be much better off."

The Issue
One of @@NAME@@'s highest-ranking nobles, Lord Giles, has been criticized for the draconian management of his estate. After the ninth execution of a serf was reported within a month, you have traveled to Giles' court to discuss the matter personally.

The Debate
1. "You're just in time for the entertainment!" booms Lord Giles, flashing you a toothy grin. "Pay no mind to any outcries, @@LEADER@@. The lower folk must know their place; we can't give the wretches any leeway, can we? Now, do stick around. We've got a wonderful choir performing soon, made up of some of the little 'uns from a nearby village. You wouldn't believe what the threat of punishing their parents does to their music: heavenly sounds! I swear, @@NAME@@ could learn a thing or two."

2. Lady Giles, clothed all in black, observes another execution from afar. "That one made some disparaging remarks about us in a tavern," she notes flatly, sighing. "Truth be told, this has all gotten so boring. The event's over too quick, not to mention that people can't learn their lesson when they're dead. Active rehabilitation of these peasants - by which I mean frequent beatings - would be so much more efficient for the estate's funds... and provide us with such lively entertainment."

3. The keeper of the estate's keys, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pulls you aside. "None of us can take much more of this," @@HE@@ whispers. "Any one of the estate servants, not to mention the regular villagers, could be targeted next. If the threat of retribution wasn't so ominous, I'd have locked them out of the house long ago. This is not normal. This is not right. On my life, I beg of you to close the shutters on this charade and remove these two tyrants from their positions of power."

4. "Why are local nobles in charge of executions, anyway?" interjects the court gardener, while planting an evergreen. "If we allow the nobility to maintain near-absolute power, it would only be a matter of time before they abuse their power in some other way. This overgrowth of corruption by our feudal lords must be uprooted and burned like a pernicious weed! If the national government takes back its shears of judicial power, the other nobles will think twice before setting themselves up to be pruned."

5. A yellow-robed jester approaches you, displaying gaudily-designed finger puppets on his right hand. Oddly enough, you notice the puppets bear a strong resemblance to a number of powerful @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ nobles. After a moment, the jester brings out his left hand, revealing more finger puppets that are dressed in rags and carry pitchforks and torches. Without saying a word, he pantomimes a fight between the two groups in which the peasants beat the nobles into submission and chase them away. Winking at you, he blends back into the crowd.

The Issue
More and more people have been developing allergies — some severe — to especially potent scents. Allergy specialists and sufferers alike are asking you to stick your nose into this business.

The Debate
1. "Everyone knows that we cannot bear these malodorous assaults on our senses!" protests nasally-sensitive allergy specialist Rosemary Thyme between sneezes. "I am persistently surrounded by people who drown themselves in Eternity Is a Long Time or Channel Number 5: A Newswoman's Perfume. Who knows what these allergic reactions are costing the economy due to lost productivity? Ban the sale of these products!"

2. "While Rosie has the right idea, an outright ban is only one part of the equation," gasps Lavender O'Dor, choking due to your fragrant aroma. "You need enforcement officers to make sure people are in full compliance with any perfume ban, which should also include body lotions, deodorants, the lot! My sanity depends on this!"

3. "You want to tell me what I can and cannot wear when it comes to my personal grooming?" snorts neighbourhood narcissist Imma Mirorslav. "That idea stinks. Darling, listen, I have certain standards to uphold, and my collection of 250 perfumes are a vital part of who I am! If these nosy persons cannot stand being around my exquisite self, perhaps they should all hold their noses instead."

4. "While I empathize completely with the plight of these people, there surely has to be a sensible solution to this," coos fragrance magnate Calvin Colon, who nonchalantly slips a few samples of his latest scents into your pocket. "I smell an opportunity here for fairness: just legislate that every workplace should have sections for those who want to adorn their beautiful bodies with my creations, and for those who prefer… natural scents." He wrinkles his nose disdainfully.

The Issue
A call for help triggered a raid at the remote 'Seeking Glory Compound', the base of the polygamist Fundamentalist Brotherhood, which is said to be a cult by many. As a manhunt was launched for the group's elusive leadership, a search of the compound uncovered evidence that the group has been performing forced polygamous weddings for some time.

The Debate
1. "This is the true face of polygamy," declares Ann Eliza @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, a former member of the Brotherhood turned vocal anti-polygamy activist, brandishing a photograph of herself with a bushy-bearded man and eighteen other pastel-clad women. "Women raised like veal: no reading books, no childhood toys, not even any coloured chalk in the schoolroom. They are brainwashed into believing they need to grow up to marry the old geezer with halitosis to gain 'eternal glory'. Just f... forget these plygs' rights; what about their children's freedom? Ban polygamy, and prosecute whenever the law is violated!"

2. "This so-called 'evidence' was probably planted by our enemies. But let's just suppose it's true," growls self-named Brotherhood spokesman, diminutive sexagenarian Dick 'Big Richard' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, who is surrounded by his nine dead-eyed wives. "How can anything begat in Truth be a crime? 'Cos, I gotta tell ya, if our wholesome lifestyle - received when Prophet Hezekiah Obadiah Zachariah @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ was visited by the Angel Cletus - can be persecuted, soon every religion will be illegal. You won't even be allowed to send Maxxmas cards. Rather than waste money persecuting goodly people, why not support holy men? Raising ninety-eight kids ain't cheap."

3. "This man does not represent us," insists @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, the founder of pro-polygamy pressure group [i]Real Love is Infinite[/i]. "It's plain prejudicial to group us independents and the multilateral marriages of Church of Pizza fundamentalists with Brotherhood scum. While we commit no crime, let us love and marry whoever we want, regardless of sexual orientation or the number of spouses. While we're at it, let's use media and outreach to teach @@NAME@@ about polygamy's benefits: the friendship found only among sister-wives, the benefits of two husbands, and that the good men are [i]never[/i] taken.

4. "As long as Timmy and Tammy from @@ANIMAL@@ County may say 'I do'," states your Minister of Parity and Biscuits, passing custard creams to your guests, "Mr. and Mrs. and Mrs. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ must be allowed to abide by the same laws. But we must stamp out the horror of forced marriage. Let there be new restrictions, applied to each couple... trio... whatever.

The Debate
1. "The interwebs and socialist media are to blame," groans your elderly Minister of War. "They shouldn't be allowing terrorists to thrive on their services. Force those tech companies to ban Violetist zealots from using their sites. Delete their accounts and block them from the net."

2. "These companies have a lot of information on these radical Violetists: location, search history, passwords, and more," effuses your Minister of Internal Security. "They should aid our country in combating the militants by sharing all their user information with us. We'll use the data well." The minister tries to hold back laughter.

3. A video chat window opens up, revealing the melancholic visage of MyFace CEO Marcus Sugarmountain. "As a private company, we have the right to determine how our services are used. Why not think of this situation differently? Most people who join these radical groups are disaffected Violetist youths who are unhappy in @@NAME@@. Try to empathize with them and understand their culture, and they'll assimilate in no time."

4. "Young Violetists are not driven to fight because they're bullied," pontificates your Minister of Secularism, inserting sacred texts into a shredder. "They actually join the militants because they hold strong religious beliefs. I recommend that all Violetists be kept in mental institutions until they are cured.

At present, it is official policy to ban the general population from having cars, but to allow the police to do so. This has placed unexpected stresses on police departments, as they often find themselves using their vehicles to ferry sick and injured citizens during emergency situations.

The Debate
1. "Our cars are not meant for these purposes!" complains senior police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ attempts to stop a pregnant woman in the early stages of labour from entering the back of @@HIS@@ vehicle. "Ordinary citizens and medical personnel have been pestering us continuously! I've been wasting more time sending kids to school than I have spent pursuing hardened criminals and serial jaywalkers. It should be a criminal offence to bother the police with such unnecessary requests."

2. "We wouldn't have to bother the police if you made a few reasonable exclusions to the car ban," objects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a perfectly healthy individual, who has been trying to convince the officer to transport @@HIS@@ groceries for @@HIM@@. "Emergency services should have ambulances and fire engines. Also doctors, delivery drivers, postal workers, tradesmen, builders and the like should be able to have vehicles. Oh, and commuters, people with children, people who have widespread social engagements, leisure drivers. Just make a few exceptions to the ban, and it'll all be fine!"

3. "While I understand their concerns, allowing citizens to have cars is a bit too much," comments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a paramedic, who is stretchering a patient to a police car. "It's true that many civilians are wasting police time, but they have a good reason to do so. Public transport still doesn't have sufficient capacity to cater to the population, so citizens resort to asking the police for help.

While chauffeuring you to work this morning, your driver notified you of a recent spike in motorized vehicle accidents.

But this is definitely a public safety concern, and it's common sense that there'll be deaths on the road from this. And surely, safety is your number one priority, right?

"Boys get chemistry kits and toy robots. Girls get baby dolls and make-up sets. Is it any wonder they think mathematics and science aren't meant for them?

A controversial concert at the nation's largest penitentiary headlined by guitarist Ronnie @@CURRENCY@@ went awry after he began playing his newest song, '@@CAPITAL@@ Prison Blues'. Buoyed by the anti-establishment message, the inmates became increasingly rowdy, resulting in a massive cell block riot. Inmates across the country have followed suit, with nationwide prison riots plunging the system into chaos.

There's no way we can contain these riots with our current personnel numbers!

Unfortunately, there is no known cure or vaccine for the disease at the moment, and the head of Border Control is considering restricting the entry of that nation's citizens into @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "Papers, please!" shouts the beleaguered head of Border Control Ezic Arstotzka while examining a stack of entry documents. "That nation is guilty of very lax medical checks and borders that may as well be nonexistent. They might unknowingly send some people infected with this bizarre ailment to us.

2. "How rude!" gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the rather pale ambassador of the afflicted nation. "Firstly, we shall not tolerate any negativity whatsoever toward our proud governmental institutions.

3. "Let's not be too hasty about this," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Minister of Health, as the ambassador is dragged out of the room. "Why don't we screen every visitor with an immunoglobulin blood test, and only admit those who test as being clear of the disease?

4. "Our citizens are in danger!" screeches @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the absurdly paranoid Defence Secretary, speaking to you through a hazmat suit. "We must insist that all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ return home at once! Those that don't are probably already infected and should be left for dead.

Citing lack of support for the fishing industry from the government, they are threatening to eradicate the wild @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ fish populations if their demands are not met.

The Debate
1. Communicating via telecom to your office is the spokesperson for the Cult of the Dammed, Kelly Tizad, holding a sinister-looking frozen vial. "On behalf of our leader, the Fish King, we demand a total repeal of all fishing industry regulations and for the government of @@NAME@@ to relinquish control of all waterways to the Cult of the Dammed and our approved fisheries! Anything less than this and we will release a genetically engineered virus that shall see the end of aquatic biodiversity as you know it!"

2. Up-and-coming military officer Captain Arthur Menthol immediately disconnects the monitor. "We do not negotiate with terrorists! Their boats will make excellent aquatic habitat, I say! Give me a few navy cruisers to seek out the boats of these terrorists. We will have them sleeping with the fishes and end this threat."

3. "Have you lost your mind, Arthur?" retorts your Minister of Lightly-Fried Fish Fillets Gunther Knight. "How can we even consider such wanton slaughter? Genetically engineered viruses sound like the stuff of science fiction anyway; these terrorists are probably bluffing. Just in case, we could always keep a few of every species of fish found in Milostein breeding in captivity. That way, if they do follow through on their threat we can always restock our rivers and lakes."

4. "That gives me an idea," ponders fishing mogul Gordon Silver. "Those cultists want to ruin our environment and tourism by killing our fish, so let's completely deny them the opportunity! Let's take all of the fish in the lakes and streams and put them in tiny fish apartments! In fact, we can charge people an admission fee to see our fish and frame it as a tourist experience!"

2. "Get off your moral high horse," jeers a bookmaker, sipping her mint julep. "Horse racing is the lifeblood of @@NAME@@, so we should be building more tracks and breeding more horses! The animals may get injured, but their mistreatment is overblown. Many people flock here to place their bets and give us money because of our lucrative racecourses. Why stop?

3. "So much cruel and useless death," brays Professor Ungar, clutching a captive bolt gun. "Scientific advancement is more crucial than animal rights or gambling, and horses have a purpose to serve. Out of compassion, ban horse racing and let kind scientists like me take care of the thoroughbreds. I will treat them humanely in my experiments.

As your security staff caught a Bigtopian intern trying to set fire to the report in your wastepaper basket, it may perhaps be time for action.

The Debate
1. "This is about efficient policing and prevention over punishment," suggests slick-suited Pre-Crime Operations Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@, glancing at you suspiciously as @@HE@@ looks up from a print-out of your family tree. "Let's focus existing surveillance resources on high-risk communities, maybe perform the odd stop-and-search, and carry out the occasional preventative intervention.

2. "That is the voice of unfounded institutional racism," says Bigtopian ex-gang member turned youth outreach worker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a ball point pen at you in what seems to be an overly threatening manner. "Human beings are equal, and all should be treated equally by the law, with no individual or group singled out by the state. Why should we face police oppression just because of your prejudices?"

"Allowing students to exercise their body as well as their mind prepares them for a fit and healthy life and makes them much more attractive candidates when seeking a job.

2. "We're not here to ogle over a bunch of dumb jocks," flatly states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an undergraduate studying for a degree in public speaking. "This is merely a waste of money that would be much better spent on expanding libraries and academic facilities for all students. Why should we fritter away money on funding athletic programs when students can just as well achieve the same goals of exercise on their own? We must make sure that this trend is stopped dead in its tracks."

3. "I say, old sport, these fellows do have interesting proposals, but I have a much better idea!" proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who waves around a fencing sword for dramatic effect. "We should leave money and professionalization out of all matters regarding sport.

The Issue
After two @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ agents operating in Blackacre were compromised and forced to flee the country, a private military corporation known as the Webber Group has approached you about taking over the nation's intelligence-gathering activities.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, my operatives are perfect for this type of work," declares Webber Group CEO @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, flanked by two burly bodyguards. "Many of them have received military training prior to joining our company, so they're well versed in espionage, counter-intelligence, and assassina... um... proactive regime change strategies. If they're caught, you can deny any knowledge of them. Together, we can revitalize the foreign intelligence apparatus of @@NAME@@... for a small fee, of course."

2. "Are we really going to put the safety of our nation in the hands of this... thug?" questions secret agent James Bont while drinking a martini. "What the Webber Group fails to tell you is that many of their operatives were dishonorably discharged. They're violent, averse to authority, and unpredictable. Not to mention they're only loyal to a paycheck. @@LEADER@@, let me organize a training program for our less-experienced spies so they never get caught again."

The Issue
A shocking exposé by a rogue official in the Department of Immigration revealed that dozens of elected representatives hold dual citizenship, with many of them hailing from your party. Angry citizens are now questioning the loyalty of these politicians and are demanding that they resign.

The Debate
1. "This is a disaster!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Minister of Internal Affairs, turning pale as he sees the growing number of protestors gathering outside your office. "We must force every single official with dual citizenship to step down immediately; after all, we can't be sure where their allegiances truly lie. Our integrity as a party will not survive this incident unscathed unless we send a strong message that dishonesty cannot be tolerated."

2. "You call that sending a message?" raves xenophobe @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the notorious author of [i]@@LEADER@@ is a Secret Bigtopian Spy: The Truth Revealed[/i]. "Those filthy aliens managed to infiltrate the highest levels of our government, and are probably going to enforce radical Violetist law the instant they take over. The only way to save our nation is to strip these traitors of their @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizenship and send them back to whichever hellhole countries they're working for. If you refuse... then I'll finally have concrete proof that you really are a Bigtopian in disguise!"

3. "Can we just talk it out?" pleads the Secretary of the Treasury, who was outed as having Brancalandian citizenship. "There are perfectly legitimate reasons for politicians to have connections to more than one nation. For example, those of us who immigrated here should be able to visit relatives in the old homeland without having to fill out a mountain of paperwork. Plus, citizens of Brancaland get a free barrel of maple syrup every year! If you outlaw this, I'm holding you personally responsible for the sugar withdrawal."

4. "There's no need to change anything," whispers your Minister of Spying, Subterfuge, and Baked Goods while showing you his latest exploding pie prototype. "You should let me handle this little problem. It appears that a pesky official within the Department of Immigration snitched on your friends. We'll fabricate a charge to implicate that ingrate and squeeze a confession out of her to reduce her credibility. She'll then be exiled somewhere while we modify the citizenship records of the implicated officials. Does that sound good to you? If so, I think we have time to demonstrate the weaponized muffins."

Simply issue a few leaflets that doctors can hand out to their patients about cheap foods that are naturally gluten-free."

The Issue
During a recent speech, a particularly embarrassing pose you struck became rather popular on the internet. The pose has spawned numerous parodies and humorous political commentary. A few of your bewildered advisers have asked you to address the so-called '@@LEADER@@ Meme'.

The Debate
1. "These images are ruining your image!" points out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an adviser from your Department of Redundancy Department. "They make you look like an incompetent and imprudent fool, especially in rival enemy nations. I heard Maxtopia is putting up posters and placards of these so-called 'memes' in their subways! What may seem like innocent, benign images could evolve into political action that will inspire protests and riots! You have to ban insulting images of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ politicians."

2. "You can't take away that freedom!" pleas @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an adviser from your Department of Office Vending Machine Contents. "I mean, look at this one! It's so funny! And this one here, they made it look like you're holding a cat! I say keep them coming. People like a leader with a sense of humor. If you punish those who use free speech to peacefully protest, the backlash you'll receive will be far worse than these pictures."

3. "I agree. In fact, I think we can make an opportunity of this," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an adviser from your Department of Memetic Imagery, which you don't recall having. "Some of these may be a bit insulting, sure, but some of them are lighthearted, or even beneficial. The one with you and a cat? It makes you look gentle and appreciative of animals. To better your image, we should masquerade as everyday citizens, and create and spread favorable memes ourselves."

4. "Sometimes we make mistakes," admits @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an adviser from your Department of Political Choreography. "That's why pencils have erasers. Like other fads, this '@@LEADER@@ Meme' will die out; you just have to give it time. Meanwhile, you could benefit from practicing your stage performance for future speeches and appearances. Y'know, to prevent this from happening again."

The Issue
Sporting events have always drawn big crowds of passionate fans, but those same crowds can bring a temporary surge in crime. While extra policing can be assigned, questions have been raised over who should pay for this.

The Debate
1. "These are big-profit events for the corporations that run them, but they generate considerable externalities which must be paid for by taxpayers," explains Police Assistant Accountancy Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, seeming excited to be at the centre of attention for once. "Let the profiteers pick up the extra cost, as guesstimated... I mean, carefully calculated by my department."

2. "Excuse me? Since when have private companies been liable to fund public services?" retorts CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@, showing you an empty wallet to emphasise her point, though her gesture is diminished in impact by it being a ridiculously expensive crocodile-skin, diamond-studded designer piece. "If you cut into profits, you discourage free market enterprise, and if you do that, there'll be less sporting entertainment. And you know what happens when a populace doesn't get its sports? That's right - they start thinking about politics, and criticising their social betters. Do you really want that to happen?"

3. "Oi oi, there's no need for all this bovver," grins die-hard fan Four Fingers @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, hiding a bloodied length of scaffolding pole behind his back. "So we like to let off a bit of steam before and after the match, and have a bit of a scrap. It's all good fun, and nobody who don't wants to be there has to be there if they don't wants to be, right? So why not give the rozzers the day off, and let us sort ourselves out?"

[4]. "Sports fans are a nasty bunch, but you've got to admire their fighting spirit," comments Colonel @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ with a wry smile. "Come wartime, we could use men of their calibre.

"Our virtuous and benevolent ruler shall extract a small sum of eight million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in restitution.

Did you forget that compensation of any sort is outlawed in @@NAME@@? There's a good reason for that — if we had it, citizens and businesses alike would be at the mercy of greedy claimants, and nobody would dare sell anything due to the risk of having to pay damages.

4. "I have a better idea, one that won't cost us a single @@CURRENCY@@!" claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the State Treasurer. "We could just decide who is right with a duel! The claimant and the person who supposedly caused the damage will fight to the death, and whoever survives gets the other person's stuff as spoils and remuneration for wasting their time!

Duke @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ of Lower @@CAPITAL@@-Upon-Tyne caused quite a stir this weekend after he had a traveling minstrel group chased out of town. While some fellow peers have accused him of being humorless, the Duke countered that the troupe was subverting his authority with their seditious acts.

The Debate
1. "That troupe's impromptu performance was scandalous," spits the irate Duke. "Caricaturing me as the villain in their little Scheherazade knock-off? The nerve of those performers! Do you think I let these thespian transients wander around my domain just to watch them humiliate our way of life? I've no obligation to provide charity to a bunch of disrespectful wretches. @@LEADER@@, forbid these flimflam singsongs and outlaw this sort of vagrancy before some smart-alecky troupe comes knocking at your door.

2. "Have you no sense of perspective?" exclaims beaten and ragged minstrel @@RANDOM_NAME@@, haphazardly waving a flute around. "Satire is essential for introspection! Don't be such a stuffed shirt. If you really want performers off the street, let us musicians be officially patronized by the government.

"Me and my mates, your musicians, clowns, acrobats, dancing poodle performers, you name it - we're smart enough not to bite the hand that feeds us.

A dubious study in a dubious scientific magazine recently asserted that pizza is healthy, preventing heart disease, curing cancer and treating low libido. The scientific community rapidly discredited the study, but not before newspaper headlines had many @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ believing it.

The Debate
1. "This is a cheese-topped catastrophe! A doughy disaster!" moans paediatrician Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has spent all morning trying to convince mums not to put their kids on a pizza-only diet. "Science can't move forward if its legitimacy is being undermined by bad studies!

2. "You can't stop bad science," complains sociologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What you can do, however, is expect the media to check if studies are legitimate. Just fine news networks each time they broadcast misleading information or fail to check their scientific sources, and hold them legally accountable for the consequences of misinformation."

3. "Mamma mia, I tell you this is the truth!" exclaims Professor Giuseppe De Luigi, of the Independent Pizza Research Institute. "The ivory tower of academia has been saying for years that pizza was making the bambinos obese, but here is the evidence!

Last night, in the finals of popular reality TV contest [i]@@REGION@@vision[/i], the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ representative lost, despite giving what almost all critics in @@NAME@@ have declared to be a superior performance. The enraged masses have inexplicably decided that the best course of action is to storm your office to voice their complaints.

The Debate
1. "It was rigged!" chants real housewife of @@CAPITAL@@, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ Karsprintian, who is so angered that she is speaking at a pace you're having trouble keeping up with. "Half the judges looked to be Maxtopian to me, and you know what [i]those people[/i] think of us and our culture. The contest must be rerun, this time with more unbiased judges from @@NAME@@. If the rest of @@REGION@@ doesn't agree, threaten trade sanctions, heck, maybe even outright war. Our national pride depends on this!"

2. "Clearly, the rest of @@REGION@@ are just uncultured idiots!" crescendoes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was recently voted the country's most-eligible bachelor. "If they can't appreciate us, who needs them? The government should sponsor its own patriotic song contest! Call it @@DEMONYM@@ Idol, only let native-born @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ compete, and let @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ vote for a winner. A song for the people, by the people, to the people, from the people.

3. "For sure, everyone knows that [i]@@REGION@@vision[/i] always has every nation giving top marks to their favourite historic allies," intones reality show survivor Geoff Probes. "Maybe instead you should be asking why other nations don't feel inclined to treat @@NAME@@ that way.

Healthcare in @@NAME@@ is widely acknowledged as among the best in the world. Hospitals have seen a steady influx of patients from abroad. However, with so much medical tourism, there are claims that this is making it difficult for native @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to access their own healthcare system.

The Debate
1. "This is outrageous!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is camped outside @@CAPITAL@@ Public Hospital under a makeshift tent. "I came in for a routine checkup over a week ago, and no one has seen me yet. There are too many foreigners taking up our doctors' valuable time! We have to ban access to healthcare services for all non-citizens. It's not our fault their healthcare systems aren't as good as ours. Realistically, this is the only way to guarantee the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ people are getting the healthcare we deserve."

2. "Whoa there!" interrupts Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the nation's leading posterior surgeon. "We have definitely been swamped with foreign patients, but turning them down altogether seems a bit harsh. How about we only accept non-citizens as patients if they have contracted a life-threatening illness or injury while traveling through @@NAME@@? That way, we won't turn away the needy in our own country, but we also won't be besieged with patients from other nations."

3. "Now hold on!" shouts your Secretary of Health as @@HE@@ stumbles in with excitement. "This presents a great opportunity! There's no question that our healthcare resources are some of the best in the world. Why shouldn't we use this as leverage to cash in on foreign desperation? We could make a lot of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ by charging steep fees to non-citizens! This way, only those willing to pay can get in, and the extra money will ensure that our hospitals are well-equipped for the influx. It's a win-win solution! Well, except for the poor foreigners, but you can't save them all."

4. "Where is your compassion?" chides foreign celebrity @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has had extensive cosmetic surgery performed at @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ hospitals. "You can't simply shun your foreign patients! Some of these people don't even have basic medical care in their home countries. You have to grow a heart and understand that people only come to you because you're the best.

5. "Call me Captain Obvious," says airline pilot Captain Tom Obvious, "but doesn't a near-miss air collision suggest we need to be spending more on air safety? We need more air traffic controllers working shorter shifts, and fewer night-time and bad weather flights. What? Someone has to be sensible here." His co-pilot, Jane Sensible, nods in agreement.

"I wrote the song to represent all of the good things about the nation's people like... like... well, you know. We need to take back my anthem!

The Issue
After years of searching for the most wanted man in @@NAME@@, you are finally sitting in the war room, eyes glued to the images on the live video feed. It's confirmed: the drone can see the infamous terrorist @@RANDOM_NAME@@... playing with his children. It seems like it will be impossible to take the shot without also killing the small children.

The Debate
1. "Wait! We can't hurt those little ones," wails your aide, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while clutching @@HIS@@ face in horror. "I know that he's a monster who has killed and will kill again, but are we really going to stoop down to his level? Those kids are innocent of any of the atrocities their father has committed. We must hold our fire and try to find another way that doesn't have such a high risk of collateral damage."

2. From the corner of the monitor, you can see a terrorist soldier spot the drone and begin to assemble a surface-to-air-missile launch platform. The operator turns around in his chair with a look of urgency. "Boss, we're just about to lose the drone. It's now or never! Authorise me to take the shot. If we let him go, it might take years for us to find him again - and who knows how many more children he might kill in the meantime? The inevitable loss of the little ones will be regrettable, but we need to take him out now!"

[b][anchor=974]#974[/anchor]: Siren Song [Candensia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
During a severe weather outbreak yesterday, weather sirens raised the alarm about the incoming danger. However, that didn't seem to concern residents, who had grown all too used to constant tests and malfunctions associated with the aging system. Following dozens of fatalities, a discussion has arisen regarding the best method to warn the public about approaching weather threats.

The Debate
1. "I'm tired of weathering weather sirens!" shouts storm survivor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, still wearing @@HIS@@ soggy raincoat. "I'm in my house, glued to my phone, when I thought I heard a train. Turns out, it was no train; it was a twister coming straight at me! Sure, I heard the sirens, but they go off all the time! Instead of listening out for old sirens, we should get official weather alerts through our phones. I mean, people definitely won't ignore their cell phones!"

2. "Well, not everyone has a cell phone, and what if its battery dies in the middle of a storm, what then?" questions @@NAME@@ Emergency Management spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The biggest advantage to sirens is that we can assure that they will always work... as long as they aren't old, malfunctioning, or whatever. It should be clear that a refit of the siren system is on the radar. All we need to do is update them to be more... attention-grabbing. I'm sure citizens won't ignore weather sirens if we replace the wail with, say, a blood-curdling scream!""

3. "Why is it the government's responsibility to warn us of incoming life or death situations?" rants well-known libertarian political speaker @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, failing to intervene as his infant picks up a nearby nail gun. "It's the responsibility of the individual to ensure their own safety. We shouldn't be wasting @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ maintaining a faulty, hardly-used system. I say we let the old siren system die, save ourselves some money, and call it a day. If the average @@DEMONYM@@ doesn't have enough common sense to take caution when the weather gets bad, then I forecast that @@NAME@@ has a far bigger problem."

The Issue
A teenager recently made headlines when he filed a lawsuit against his parents who had shared his photos on MyFace without his consent, prompting a discussion on whether parents have the right to post their kids' pictures without their permission.

The Debate
1. "This is a shameless infringement of my client's privacy!" thunders @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the lawyer of the teenage plaintiff, while @@HE@@ spreads an array of @@HIS@@ client's intimate childhood pictures on your desk. "You see, these irresponsible parents have unscrupulously documented the most private moments of my client, taking shots of him while he sat upon a potty chair, or ran around in his diapers, and then they shared them on their MyFace account! I don't even need to mention the weirdos who may now have access to these sensitive pictures. Distributing any pictures of minors online, or offline, should be a criminal offense!"

2. "Frankly, I don't understand why this is even an issue," grumbles @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the mother of the disgruntled teenager, as she snuggles up to you and pouts her lips to #TakeASelfieWithTheLeader. "I mean, what is more natural for a mother than to take the pictures of her pretty little pumpkin and his adorable chubby bum, and to share them with her friends? We can't take the tantrums of a pubescent kid high on hormones seriously, can we? As legal guardians, parents should be allowed to dispose of their kids' pictures as they like."

*3. "Ahem, I say we don't have to think in binary terms," chips in Marcus Sugarmountain, the founder of MyFace, while he nervously scans your room with wide, bulging eyes. "I would first like to assure you that our app is very safe. Nobody would ever need to fear a data leak or any breach of security on our part. But if half-naked photos of kids are a problem, in order to safeguard our profile, we could simply program a bot to sift through all photos in our database and to tag and remove the ones in which too much flesh is exposed.

The Issue
Reports that more and more @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are seeking exorcisms for being possessed by evil spirits are fuelling rumours of an impending apocalypse.

The Debate
1. "What absolute hokum!" asserts famous sceptic @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, shaking her head in disbelief. "All these people who claim to be possessed are attention-seeking drama-queens. Demonic possession is not real. We need a public information campaign which states that demons are imaginary, the apocalypse isn't coming and everyone should just calm down."

2. "DEMON! I'm going to need some help here," screams exorcist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, as he begins sprinkling her with holy water. As his baffled assistants take over pinning her down, he turns to you. "My congregation alone has thousands of citizens and they all claim to be possessed. I can't administer exorcisms to all these people all by myself. The government needs to set-up a massive recruitment drive for all the remaining non-possessed citizens to become exorcists and fast-track their exorcism training."

3. "The hour of damnation is at hand!" shouts Monk de Wally de Honk, a doomsday 'prophet' who frequently changes his forecast of the date of the apocalypse. "I have studied the words of holy books and the stars, and @@NAME@@ doesn't have much time! I implore you to move those remaining souls who aren't possessed to safe, remote, and unaffected areas of the nation. The purity and isolation of the land shall keep us safe!"

4. Finally, a man dressed in a dark suit and holding a pile of contracts seems to appear out of nowhere. "I am from the law firm Horace, Edward, Logan and Lee. My client has instructed me to inform you that there is only one way to save the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ people from this calamity. Tell all of them to sign these contracts, then my client shall transport them all to a place far away from the imminent catastrophe. There's nothing to be suspicious about, my client is a reasonable fellow."

The Issue
In the midst of a religious ritual deep in the jungles of @@NAME@@, members of the Ngwane tribe were blindsided by a sudden police raid. Citing laws against body modification, the police dumped out barrels of tattoo ink, confiscated store huts full of piercings, and arrested the Ngwane.

The Debate
1. "This is a sad chapter in our history," observes tribal Chief U'ana Nosren'g, stroking the chicken bone he wears as a chin-piercing. "The ancestor spirits weep at the sacrilege our people have had to endure. The boys who were being inducted into manhood can now never be considered to be true men. This is religious discrimination and oppression of my people. Please let my people go and allow body piercing and modification once more."

2. "My team was just following the law," states SWAT captain @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who oversaw the raid. "They get no sympathy from me. Anyone who lives within our jurisdiction is subject to our rules and regulations. The laws against body modification help promote public order and traditional values. Let this go, and you're re-opening the door to inked gang-members and pierced punks."

3. "I doubt that our primitive friends were intentionally ignorant," coos @@RANDOM_NAME@@, board member with the religious recreation camp 'Fun with Faith'. "Their determination to pursue these modifications stemmed from their backwards beliefs and simple-minded tribal ways. If you'd just sponsor our outreach program, we could perhaps guide the Ngwane down the path towards a more advanced faith. Change starts with the children, you know."

4. "Just leave these people alone!" wails inner-city guru @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has crafted 'tribal solidarity bracelets' out of beads and tatty string. "If the police hadn't interfered in the first place, that village would still be celebrating their rituals, none the wiser! Not only should we let them live as they see fit, we need to return all these tribes to their original isolated states. Drop all contact immediately, and then retreat from ever laying a finger on them again."

The Issue
Convicted criminal and former journalist @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ was recently released from @@CAPITAL@@ Central Penitentiary. @@HE_1@@ is now revealing to the media the horrors that @@HE_1@@ suffered behind bars, specifically the "torture and terror" of solitary confinement.

The Debate
1. "Solitary confinement is demoralizing, dehumanizing, and wrong," explains @@LASTNAME_1@@, letting wind and rain soak your desk paperwork as @@HE_1@@ throws your office window wide open. "Research has proven that it causes immense levels of lasting psychological trauma! It's also much more expensive for the prison system, and is little more than state-sanctioned torture. The inhumanity of prisoners left alone in the dark must end! Ban it now!"

2. "We only put the troublemaker in the sin bin because @@HE_1@@ kept causing problems," remarks Warden @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shoving the former convict into your broom cupboard and wedging the door shut with a chair. "While solitary is used punitively to maintain prison discipline, it can also be deployed to protect the safety of the confined inmate or of other prisoners. Besides, all these ding-dongs gave up their rights the moment they turned to crime."

3. "All these prisoners are just sitting around soaking up government money; why not make them give back to society?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, local mad scientist. "We'll take a kidney, or maybe a cornea or two, and send them on their way. It'll be fantastic! They don't have to sit around all day wasting our money, and they get to go on doing whatever it is that they do. Think of all the lives we can save!"

The Issue
The unveiling of a painting of Duke @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_2@@'s daughter resulted in quite a commotion at court yesterday evening, when palace guards had to break up a scuffle between the Duke and the artist commissioned to paint the piece. Now that the persons in question have had a night to simmer down in the castle dungeon, you have requested their presence to better explain themselves.

The Debate
1. "I have patronised this worthless wastrel for six years! Six years and @@HE_1@@ produces this!" bellows the Duke, brandishing his fists at the cowering artist. "This was to be a present for my dearest daughter, and this sot - deep in her cups I'd wager - vomits up this abomination that resembles nothing other than Beelzebub's rear end! I demand repayment of @@HIS_1@@ patronage and if not, I must be allowed the right to beat it out of the wretch's hide!"

2. "I... I am sorry but I cannot return the Duke's coin," tremors @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ de @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, wringing together @@HIS@@ hands, which are stained with what is presumably red paint. "It has been spent in the execution of the painting, on the finest pigments from Dàguó and the finest wench- er- models for the piece. Besides, the good duke scarcely helped. Throughout the painting he was always questioning me when it would be complete, or if I should not include this or that within it. I am an artist! I must follow my muse! You cannot hold us artists at fault if the viewer doesn't find the painting to their liking, can you?"

[3]. "You say art, we say impious images," intones hierophant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, nearly concussing a guard with a swing of @@HIS@@ thurible. "This trend for painted depictions of Divine Creation is sheer blasphemy, and worse still are the nobles who fritter their wealth away on worldly images instead of entrusting their coin to the Holy Temple! Condemn these unholy works to the flame, lest we encourage the very worst acts of debauchery and fornication within our very nation!" [[color=purple]Must lean towards being religious[/color]]

[4]. "Ugh! This is, like, so twelfth century!" scowls Lady @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ @@LASTNAME_2@@, watching her father rage with an expression of absolute embarrassment and disdain. "I've taken, like, fifteen selfies of myself today and uploaded them to MyFace already and you haven't liked one of them! I've totally got better things to do than sit still for another portrait.

The Issue
The small, barren, and uninhabited island of Hanshedrik is claimed by both @@NAME@@ and Skandilund, and for years both sides have playfully vied for its control. New satellite images have shown that the Skandilundian flag has been planted on Hanshedrik, along with a gift of danishes. As you have no other plans today, you have called for a meeting to finally solve the dispute once and for all.

The Debate
1. "Two can play at this game!" declares your brother while lusting after the very tempting danishes on your desk. "We ought to respond in kind! Let's plant our flag on Hanshedrik, and leave them a nice gift of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ cheese. After all, mother always said there's nothing wrong with a little friendly competition!"

2. "Or we could simply give the island to Skandilund as a gesture of our goodwill," suggests your sister, after one of the danishes mysteriously vanishes. "In a world full of hostile nations like Blackacre and Maxtopia, wouldn't it be nice to have a reliable ally? Giving them Hanshedrik would be a sign of respect. Perhaps we could even invite them to negotiate a military alliance, all at the low, low cost of a worthless island and a bit of national pride."

3. "Excuse me? Don't tell me you're suggesting that we give those Skands OUR island!" roars your Defense Minister before @@HE_1@@ starts whistling innocently as another danish disappears. "Playtime is over. If these frozen hippies want OUR island, they'll have to fight us for it! We must establish a military base on Hanshedrik and defend it at all costs. That means more funding for the military to make sure everything goes smoothly."

4. "Must everything come down to war?" sighs the rarely seen ambassador of Qaanpaluk, a mysterious, but wealthy, nation made of a series of frozen islands. "Technically, Hanshedrik belongs to neither @@NAME@@ nor Skandilund and therefore is not yours or theirs to give away. Our ancestors discovered the island centuries ago and it has a spiritual significance for us. We are not an unreasonable people. If you give the island to us, we'll grant you access to some of our gold deposits." Just as you are about to grab a tasty danish, you notice the plate is now empty.

1. "We need to modify our military – and sharpish – to keep those United Federation pests out of our national territory," angrily growls General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, whilst marching a platoon of troops into your office. "We need to stop them from doing it again. Order the entire army to the border, and have them shoot any intruders on sight. That'll learn them!"

2. "Are you mad?" exclaims @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Banteen, one of your more queasy ministers, while trying to conceal @@HIS@@ worry beads. "The United Federation has Gigadeath 4000 planes, Smashtastic 2000 helicopters and Udienow 500 missiles, and we barely have glorified crop-dusters!

3. "Was it so bad for the United Federation to bring their coppers here?" sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Border Patrol Chief, while rolling @@HIS@@ eyes at the other speakers. "Mega Momo is a terrorist and if the United Federation police got him first, then good for them! In fact, if other countries want to cross our borders to arrest someone, we should let them.

[3]. "What has skill at an ancient board game got to do with intelligence?" argues Garissac Kasparasimov, CEO of tech-company Digital Thought. "Indeed, what has the limited mental prowess of our nation's leadership got to do with how smart we are as a nation? Look, @@NAME@@, maybe you're a bit of a dunce, but you can make a point by funding AI development, and perfecting a chess program that can beat any human. I mean, let's face it, it's not like a thick-headed village idiot like you could win a game of chess without artificial assistance." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

4. "This isn't about chess, this is about WMDs," explains Broderick Lightman, a teenage hacker and national tic-tac-toe champion. "When you ordered @@NAME@@ to make mega-death armaments, you put yourself into a contest of egos with nations like East Lebatuck.

5. Your Minister of National Honour bows to you. "The child is right, this isn't about chess. This is about our strength and national pride! We cannot allow these insults to go unanswered. You must increase our WMD stockpile, and put our nuclear submarines off the coast of East Lebatuck. He will withdraw his insults, or we will annihilate him."

There have been an increasing number of complaints as some doctors refuse to provide abortions and other medical treatments to patients on religious grounds. As you wait in a hospital waiting room for a routine physical, a colorful collection of activists have begun pestering you.

The Debate
1. "Freedom of religion is under attack in @@NAME@@!" declares Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is bedecked in so many religious symbols that he can't reach his stethoscope. "The government has made it obvious that they want to force doctors of faith to violate their conscience by performing procedures that go against deeply held beliefs, including the immoral act of abortion. It's appalling to try and force anyone to choose between their job and their religion. Every doctor must be able to refuse to treat anyone if it would contravene their beliefs in any way, shape or form."

2. "Funny how those who have spent their lives discriminating are now crying oppression," notes renowned feminist activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who once controversially remarked that she wished she had had an abortion, despite never having been pregnant. "The moment we give into their nonsense is the moment equality and civil rights are done away with. Religion doesn't entitle you to refuse to do your job. I implore the government to ignore these whackos and fire anyone who uses religion as an excuse to discriminate."

3. "A-ha! I have the perfect solution!" interjects your Minister of Reasonable and/or Crazy Alternatives. "These doctors don't want to perform abortions or other procedures? Fine, but we should always make sure women have safe access to these facilities should the need arise. I propose that we build fully-funded women's health clinics in every hospital and community. We'll staff them with certified pro-choice physicians and provide abortion, contraception and impartial advice. Some may not like their tax money going to this procedure, but these people only have themselves to blame."

1. "I doth be the poet himself!" Minister Porklet announces, wearing purple robes and a long wig. "Once upon a merry time, my plays amazed those large and small.

The Debate
1. "So what if those @#$%!& in some snooty guidebook don't think we're nice?" complains your waiter, oblivious to the fact that he stepped on your toes. "I should be able to say and act however the @&*% I want, all the time. That's freedom of speech, Violet damn it! Being a waiter or 'public relations' person doesn't change that one bit. And if some jerkwad tourists don't like it, well then they can go right back to where they came from!"

2. "Hate to be like this, but that guidebook has a point," reluctantly replies the restaurant's owner after telling off the waiter. "I've seen people stand up and leave after being insulted or shouted at by my staff one too many times. It doesn't matter how many times I replace them - the problem remains. The government should mandate and pay for proper etiquette training for all employees in the service industry, and allow us to fire those who don't comply.

The Debate
1. "Are we placing the interests of a few dirty old beasts over that of our citizens?" enquires notorious game hunter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while showing you @@HIS@@ collection of stuffed dead animal heads. "If anything the government should sell licenses to private hunters and give us the sport of putting the last of these wretched creatures out of their misery.

2. "There's no need to be so gung-ho," proposes park ranger @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while showing you photos of animals @@HE@@ has caught and released. "The government could sell licenses to private hunters, but only to hunt the much more abundant lesser-spotted @@ANIMAL@@. Then you can use that money to fund the conservation of the great-horned @@ANIMAL@@. Perhaps after a few years the lesser-spotted @@ANIMAL@@ will become endangered too, but then we could just hunt something else."

3. "I have a way to solve this," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Alternative Solutions, while using lemonade to water your plants.

Why don't we just sedate the animals and carefully cut off the horns and sell them ourselves legally? That way the animal gets to live and we turn a profit!"

4. "Selling the horns legally isn't the answer," declares mercenary @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while whittling a crude @@ANIMAL@@ using @@HIS@@ over-sized hunting knife. "The trade will increase their demand, so poachers will still be around trying to get there first. This problem would be solved if there weren't any of these poaching scum in the first place. Just pay my team a generous sum and we will kill them all for you. Then you can be sure they won't harm these beautiful creatures ever again."

5. "We have to save this noble beast!" proclaims budding environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing a ridiculous looking fake horn on @@HIS@@ hat in solidarity. "We need highly trained and armed park rangers to guard the remaining animals around the clock. Not only that, but also prosecute retailers who sell any product derived from the horn, as well as individuals who possess it. And we need our top scientists to work on ensuring these creatures breed more and their numbers recover. If we don't do all these things, we could lose this amazing animal forever."

Prominent lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ recently quit @@HIS@@ high-profile job at a prestigious criminal defence law firm, citing that @@HE@@ can make more money by concentrating on @@HIS@@ other job: writing essays and dissertations for law students. Your cousin, who happens to be the managing partner at the firm in question - the internationally renowned Bickers, Slaughter & Hyde - is making a fuss over this.

The Debate
1. "Now see here, dear cousin, this is entirely intolerable, insupportable and insufferable," mutters @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_2@@ Bickers, as sesquipedalian as ever. "[i]Prima facie[/i], essay writing services are [i]contra bonos mores[/i].

The Debate
1. "Attention, @@LEADER@@!" shouts @@ANIMAL@@ physiology student @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has a telescoped spine from carrying textbooks. "We - the oppressed, overstressed, and consistently underdressed - are tired of foregoing meals and basic comforts in order to afford the required tools for our education! We, the future of @@NAME@@, have come to request that you force publishing companies to lower the price of our essential textbooks!"

2. "@@LEADER@@, don't let those hooligans intimidate you!" says famed textbook author Goodman DiPyro. "Textbooks are an important aspect of the education experience and current market prices are reflective of this. How can a medical student identify the difference between a cyst and a lipoma without the most accurate and descriptive images possible? If anything, subsidising textbook authors and publishers will help boost the modern @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ learning experience while generously rewarding us for being so integral to the education system!"

[3].

Today terror struck an antiques show when a would-be seller, unhappy with the price offered for his 200-year-old blunderbuss, decided instead to open fire. Luckily nobody was killed, seeing as the museum piece was wrestled off him during the minute and a half it was taking him to reload, but many are asking how the gun ban was so easily circumvented.

The Debate
1. "Look, let's not be too hasty in drawing conclusions," says antiques vendor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, rubbing at the sore patch on @@HIS@@ left buttock where a low velocity lead ball left a nasty bruise. "I must confess I was offering an insultingly small pittance for such a piece of history, but I have my own bottom line to look after! I believe that citizens should be able to keep such historic beauties that happen to be family heirlooms from before the ban. They certainly make these car-boot sales much more interesting!"

2. Security guard @@RANDOM_NAME@@ glares at the previous speaker with one remaining eye. "Easy for you to say, that wound isn't permanent! I knew something suspicious was going to happen as soon as that good for nothing lowlife walked in with that big boomstick. We got rid of the guns for a reason, and this is exactly it! I say we go from house-to-house and confiscate all remaining guns from the populace, no matter their age, legality or functionality!"

3. "The law as it stands says that old pieces can be kept so long as they are deactivated," suggests police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was hit by a small piece of shrapnel in the middle of @@HIS@@ stomach. "The problem here isn't that the weapon exists, but that it was so easily reactivated. We need to raise standards on how deactivation takes place, to make sure that antique weapons have no chance of being restored to working condition. Make deactivation more thorough, and also ban the sale of the spare weapon parts that make reactivation possible."

The number of pregnant tourists arriving in @@NAME@@ dramatically increased after the country started granting citizenship to all babies born on its soil. Several of your sources report that most of these birth tourists are wealthy and often come from authoritarian nations.

The Debate
1. "Of course they come here; we grant citizenship like we were born yesterday, without regard for heritage!" exclaims Grand Mage @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leader of a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ nationalist group. "The mothers come here and pay to stay in some luxury hotel suite, give birth, then go back to their country. It's wrong! Soon these kids will grow up and move to live in this great nation, bringing their foreign garbage cultures with them. There's nothing @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ about these babies, but we give them citizenship anyway. Mandate that only those with @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ blood in their veins can be citizens."

2. "Let's not be too hasty here," chimes in @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your chief financial adviser, scribbling some numbers on a sheet of paper. "Don't you realize what a lucrative business opportunity we have here? If these parents are willing to spend lots of money to travel here just so their kids can be citizens, maybe we should charge them for each baby born in @@NAME@@! You know, like a citizenship tax. According to my calculations, this would fill up our coffers in no time!"

3. "The government should not put our birthright up for sale," argues @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, struggling mother of two. "It's unfair that foreigners can obtain citizenship without having anything to do with @@NAME@@. So why don't we just ban pregnant women from traveling to @@NAME@@?

Leaked financial reports have revealed that three of the five largest supposedly nonprofit charity organizations in @@NAME@@ have sent a substantial amount of their revenue to offshore bank accounts over the last fiscal year, with a negligible percentage going to the causes they champion. The altruists who donated to these faux-philanthropic facades are demanding that action be taken.

The Debate
1. "They've not only manipulated us, they've given false hope to the destitute!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the dozen or so philanthropists crowded around your desk. "Half of my paycheck went to the charity BrasilistanWe last month, but according to the leaked documents, the money that should have gone to those poor children instead went toward jet skis, liquor, and goodness knows what else. The government must mandate that charities be completely transparent with their activities. We'll pay for the government monitors and investigators. Just see to it that our aid goes to the needy!"

[2]. "It truly is a sad day when humanity forsakes itself for material wealth," laments an ascetic monk, flagellating himself in your office. "I implore the citizenry to ignore avaricious secular charities, as they seek to take advantage of the people's altruism. Mandate that only religious charities can take donations since the Great Callipygian One's guidance makes us truly care for the needy. Alms-giving is an integral column of our clergy, and we have the numbers and the devotion to see our duties through." [[color=blue]Religion is legal[/color]]

3. "To the typical observer, it seems like we've been dishonest," sighs the CEO of the charity BrasilistanWe. "In truth, we sent our monies to offshore bank accounts so that they could accumulate interest, giving us more funds to help those in poverty. We were also planning to invest donations in some very lucrative stocks to generate more funds. This is what we resort to because not many people donate to charity. Ignore the exposés, allow us to continue our operations, and donate a sizable amount of cash to us to restore the people's confidence in our foundation. We'll help all the poor unfortunate souls with your contributions."

4. "Y'know, maybe it'd be best if the government make private charities less necessary by directly helping people instead," dribbles a beggar who was part of an earlier photo op showcasing the government helping the poor. "Private donations depend on people's goodwill, a scarce resource. Taxes are harder to avoid! @@NAME@@ will be the world's greatest charity! You could really help out poor folk here and abroad!"

Twitcher recently purged millions of so-called 'bots' - programs masquerading as real people - from its platform. While many welcome the move, there are many politicians and right-wing Twitcher personalities who are claiming that the purge violates their freedom of speech.

The Debate
1. "What about my freedom of speech?" demands perpetually-angry conservative Twitcher personality @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while blocking @@HIS@@ critics on @@HIS@@ phone. "This is obviously a plot by the liberal media and Twitcher to silence people like me for speaking the truth! The bots must be restored and be protected from further interference. There's nothing wrong with using these bots to spread your message and Twitcher must acknowledge that right!"

2. "Twitcher has a right to set whatever rules it wants on its website," states tofucinno-sipping liberal @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "These bots exist solely to spread misinformation and stoke divisions among @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@. Look what happened in the United Federation when bots spread fake news to help get that despot elected! I don't want to see that happening here. Bots and other such software must be banned. Oh, and bots aren't actual people, so it's not like anyone's free speech is really being infringed."

*3. "Perhaps a compromise?" suggests your Minister of Moderation, who is currently attempting to end a flame war on Twitcher. "Bots should be allowed on social media, but must clearly declare that they are bots. We have to make sure software cannot pretend to be alive! Bots can be a useful tool, but only if they are kept within strict guidelines." [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color] AND [color=blue]Must have video games[/color]]

5. "Actually, this just proves that this whole social media thing is entirely toxic," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, armchair critic of the political divisions affecting @@NAME@@. "I can't tell you how many death threats I've gotten just because I criticize certain people on Twitcher!

Preliminary trials of a new immunotherapy drug have suggested that it may achieve remission in bone marrow cancers by up to 28% of formerly untreatable patients. It's years away from being clinically available, but desperate cancer sufferers are asking for you to expedite this.

The Debate
1. "Damn bureaucrats are standing between sick people and life-saving treatment," complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a lobbyist for international pharmaceuticals company Fizer-Updick, pausing for a second as @@HIS@@ lawyer whispers something into @@HIS@@ ear. "That is to say, these [i]potentially[/i] life-saving treatments. Just cut out the red tape, and we can start saving lives. Act now or you will be murdering these poor patients!" @@HIS@@ lawyer holds up a hastily-handwritten sign behind the lobbyist's head observing that statements made may not represent the official opinion of the Fizer-Updick corporation, nor imply an accusation of legal culpability.

2. "Sorry, this is medical science, not faith healing," snarls unsympathetic-seeming Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We require multi-phase trials to make sure a medicine is non-toxic, safe in the long term and to make sure it actually really works. It's a shame that a percentage of the population have to die while we wait, but better to lose a few hundred lives than to compromise scientific integrity. No offence, but these deaths are just unavoidable collateral damage in the war on cancer."

3. At this point, you note there's a perky goth girl with a silver ankh necklace and a swirly tattoo under her right eye in the room. You swear you didn't see her come in. "Life isn't measured in years, but in moments. Moments of kindness and connection mean a lot more when death is standing right next to you. Maybe all your doctors could spend more time talking to people instead of thinking about drugs and medicines all the time. You know, listening to their dreams, destinies, desires and deliriums. It's always good to talk with someone who cares, right at the end."

A recent TV documentary revealed that some prisoners are living the high life while incarcerated. For those that can afford it, almost anything can be bought inside jails, including extended living space, state-of-the-art TVs, fridges, air-conditioning and even original works of art.

The Debate
1. "How long have prison governors been allowing these illegal transactions to take place?" rages @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Minister of Prisons, engaging in the time-honoured tradition of politicians not taking responsibility for their own departments. "Prison should be a punishment, not a holiday! We must crack down on everyone who has been abusing the system. Donate all their luxury goods to charity and transfer them back into the prison's general population, where they can share a cell with ten other people. Any prison officer that is found to have colluded with these inmates should be fired immediately!"

2. "The problem is the low wages of prison officers," declares Warden @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ gives an inmate a sandalwood oil back massage. "Our meagre salaries mean that officers will do anything to supplement it. We have families to take care of, and bills to pay. How else could I have bought a second home if I hadn't had had a little 'help' from the more affluent detainees? Increase our pay and I'm sure we'll be inclined to conduct our duty much more professionally."

3. "Let's not be hasty," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an ex-minister of yours who was jailed for corruption, speaking to you from @@HIS@@ prison cell via a private video-link. "Is this really so bad? I have become accustomed to a certain level of living and there's no fair reason why I should be denied the chance to spend my private wealth simply because of my incarceration.

Hogwash! I'll tell you what, let these momma pigs collect their welfare money, but only after sterilization! The men too! That way, we won't have any more mouths on the government's teat!"

"I have children because I love them! How can the government leave kids to suffer? I certainly can't work and raise all these children alone.

3. "You know, the real problem isn't these women," grunts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pulling @@HIM@@self up by @@HIS@@ crocodile hide bootstraps. "The real problem is that the government is wasting taxpayer money by 'helping' them at all.

The Issue
@@NAME@@ has been watching closely after a neighbouring country adopted the Maxtopian writing system in conjunction with their own native script, as it has since been prospering. A disputation about whether to follow their example has resulted in various weighty reports from competing ministries to read through.

The Debate
1. You sit down at your veranda on a quiet afternoon and start with the 642 page report by the Ministry of Tourism, which begins: "It is the opinion of the Minister that we should also adopt the Maxtopian script to run alongside our own writing system. This move would make tourism a far more lucrative prospect, business transactions would be easier and it would promote healthier relations with vital trade partners such as Maxtopia and the United Federation. The Minister mandates that it should be taught in schools immediately in order that @@NAME@@ may reap the benefits in no more than one or two generations."

2. As the afternoon progresses, you pick up the substantially heavy report by the Ministry of Culture, which leads off with: "We strongly state that we should not adopt a new writing system. The current script is rooted in generations of tradition and is the only alphabet the vast majority of @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ can read or write. The costs associated by implementing a second alphabet would be monumental, therefore the status quo must be maintained. It is further advocated that we must actively encourage greater patriotic spirit and nationalism by explicitly discouraging the use of any foreign script."

3. The sun begins to set and you now turn to the rather voluminous report by the Ministry for Creative Solutions, which starts out with: "It is clear that a new writing system is the only viable, long term solution for this present conundrum. A new system that would accurately transcribe the unique pronunciations contained within our language, promoting greater literacy. This new script shall be drafted with simplicity in mind so that native @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ and foreigners alike would have no trouble learning it. It must be immediately enacted upon and made mandatory in all areas of government, businesses and schools."

4. It's now completely dark and so you retire to bed. On the way, you happen to spot your nephew's discarded homework, covered in scribbled rantings: "This homework is stupid! Why do we even bother with writing? What good has it ever done for us? I wish schools would stop teaching it!"

The Story So Far
With the @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange bombing unlikely to ever be forgotten, @@NAME@@ has remained vigilant against the possibility of terrorist attack.

In recent months there have been a number of lone-actor terror attacks across the world, wherein everyday vehicles are weaponised and used to run down innocent pedestrians along crowded city streets.

The Debate
*1. "It's near impossible for intelligence services or law enforcement to catch these lone actors," observes city planner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while suspiciously eyeing a nearby food truck. "So we must make it equally impossible for them to commit these acts. Knee-high concrete barriers dividing traffic from pedestrian walkways positioned along all major streets and bridges, the busiest areas car-free and accessible only to well-funded public transport, and we need thorough background checks and audit trails for vehicle rental and purchase."

5. "If we haven't stopped terrorism, it's because you, the government, have not put law and order first," argues Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the @@CAPITAL@@ Police Department. "We need the powers to arrest and detain suspicious individuals before they carry out terror attacks, and to prosecute those who are engaging with terrorist ideologies or groups.

Since its establishment, [i]The Committee On Un@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Activities[/i] has been busy detaining opponents of the state and suspected East Lebatuckese infiltrators within the general populace. As of late, however, the Committee has started scrutinising and arresting low-level officials and their relatives, sparking fears amongst many in the upper echelons of the government that they may be next in the firing line.

The Debate
1. "We have to put some limits on the Committee," insists Ideological Purity Minister Mattie Hopkins, quickly hiding correspondence from her East Lebatuckese pen-pals behind her back. "Important people, such as you and I, should be above suspicion. Remind the Committee that they exist to serve the agenda of their political superiors, not to question us. Rooting out dissent in the masses should remain their sole function."

2. "We should have no more to do with witch hunts!" declares pro-liberty politician Maggie Cheysmith. "The Four Horsemen of Calumny - Fear, Ignorance, Bigotry and Smear - are abroad in this nation. Many of my comra-, I mean, my compatriots have been detained by the Committee due to tenuous links to East Lebatuck, which were based more on hearsay rather than any actual evidence.

As of late, a growing number of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizens are adopting the idea that the world is flat. After an all out brawl started in the typically level-headed Department of Geography, you've decided to call in experts on the matter to settle the issue once and for all.

The Debate
1. "It's plain to see that the world exists as a flat plane," claims amateur researcher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, playin' with homophones. "I boarded a plane once, and I didn't see the slightest bit of curvature on the plain below us as we flew over. The spherical earth theory is simply a global conspiracy by the so-called 'sciences' to flatly deny the truth of our planal existence.

2. "While we may not have the answers for everything, one thing we can be sure of is that the earth is definitely not flat," states renowned geographer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, absent-mindedly using a miniature globe as a stress-ball. "To deny this easily provable theory is the height of ignorance. We have to correct these illogical assumptions before anti-intellectualism takes root in our society. You must give us as many @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ as we need in order to show flat-earthers that their beliefs are false."

[3]. "That still won't convince them!" insists international celebrity scientist Will Zeke the Science Geek, brushing back the static of his hair.

"Let people say that the earth is round, or flat, or built on the back of a giant turtle named '@@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@'. It's just one more source of easy jokes.

2. @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ actually makes a great and under-rated point," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in a post with no geo-tag. "We really don't want to encourage everyday people to vote. They don't understand the important issues, like how it's perfectly fine that a sudden rash of pro-Bigtopia candidates are running for office, because Bigtopia is our most trusted friend and ally."

3. "This raises an interesting issue," says @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, your brother. "And that is: Why are you being such a hardass on Bigtopia? They're our most trusted friend and ally. I was there last month on a generously funded study tour and they assured me there's absolutely no covert plan to subvert and control the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ political process. So why worry about which candidate supposedly has connections to which foreign nation, when Bigtopia is our most trusted friend and ally?"

4. "I think we have to acknowledge that there is a well-advanced Bigtopian plan to seed our election with candidates," says trusted adviser @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in hushed tones, once the war room has been sealed and swept for listening devices. "It may be more subtle than a military attack, but ultimately the aim is the same. To protect the integrity of this government, we should disqualify all candidates who we discover to hold ties to a foreign power, however slight."

5. "The threat is real, but consider the implications of such a response," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who joined your office after fleeing persecution in @@HIS@@ native Maxtopia. "No candidates with foreign families or experience in other nations... we'd be restricting office to a protected minority, with the government deciding who can run. That doesn't sound particularly democratic. We should require full disclosure of personal finances and foreign connections, but ultimately let the voters decide. I hope the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ people can see through this misinformation assault, if only we give them the chance."

[b][anchor=1001]#1001[/anchor]: Will the Real Victims Please Stand Up? [Nation of Quebec; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
The nation is in uproar after a star football player was released from prison after spending six years behind bars for sexual assault, following new revelations that his disputant fabricated the entire incident. Leading lawyers, including your own, have asked you to take a stand against false accusations.

The Debate
1. "It's a disgrace that all it takes to destroy a person's life is one false allegation," protests sleazy lawyer @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who is facing multiple sexual harassment claims. "The problem is that we're so quick to believe these so-called 'victims' instead of the accused. Force them to undergo rigorous interviews and get the coppers to perform DNA tests. This will deter people from making mendacious accusations in the first place. Anyone who is found out must be jailed for the same amount of time that their so-called attacker would have been sentenced to."

2. "How can you have no sympathy for the injured party?" inquires @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the most feared prosecutor in @@NAME@@, as the men in the room all fall silent. "We absolutely should believe the victims. The harder you make it for them to come forward, the more you'll encourage the criminals to keep doing what they're doing. While it is unfortunate that sometimes inculpable people get caught up in the courts, it's better to imprison a thousand innocent men than to let one rapist go free."

3. "You know, all this talk about false allegations has gotten me worried," whispers your personal lawyer @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, as he purposely spills coffee on his crotch, then gets your young secretary to help him dry it off. "It won't be long until one of your pesky critics accuses you of a crime to ruin your career. I say we should nip that in the bud. Quietly pass a law that protects you, your cabinet, and your lawyer from any sort of legal ramifications. You rule this country. It's only fair that you are bound by none of its laws."

4. "ORDER! ORDER! Nobody has heard from me yet!" exclaims notoriously corrupt Judge @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while banging a gavel on your desk. "Quite frankly I don't care who is accused or who accuses them. I think we all know what makes our justice system go around - @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. Sentencing should be based on how much both sides are able to pay up. Sure, the poor might not be able to win in this system, but hey, that's the way the caviar crumbles!"

The Issue
@@NAME@@ has become the laughing stock of the world after The Smalltopian Sentinel published an article on the public urination problem in @@CAPITAL@@. This article cited the Smalltopian ambassador, who complained about the sordid stench outside the embassy building. Distraught at the international humiliation, your aides have come to you with a shower of suggestions.

The Debate
1. "They're calling us the latrine of @@REGION@@!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Foreign Affairs, holding a violet-scented wet wipe to @@HIS@@ nose. "The worst thing is that those despicable Smalltopian tabloids aren't even wrong: our people are marking their territory on every building wall, and there's a golden river running alongside every city street. We need to institute punitive fines to deter public urination before our good reputation gets flushed down the toilet!"

*2. "Aren't we... hic... aren't we being a little... too uh... harsh here?" slurs Yuri Nator, a perpetually drunk civil servant, struggling with his zipper before finally giving up. "I mean, if I am taking a walk with my buddies after a guys' night out and my beer wants to... get out of my body, who can stop me from... shaking hands with an old friend? Besides, I betcha holding it in must be bad for your urine bladder or something. We should be allowed to let it all go whenever and wherever we want!"

*3. "Aren't we... hic... aren't we being a little... too uh... harsh here?" slurs Yuri Nator, a civil servant who you suspect may be breaking the laws against alcohol consumption, as he struggles with his zipper before finally giving up. "I mean, if I am taking a walk with my buddies after a guys' night out and I've had too much... uh... barley water... then who can stop me from... shaking hands with an old friend? Besides, I betcha holding it in must be bad for your urine bladder or something. We should be allowed to let it all go whenever and wherever we want!" A look of relief crosses his face, as your office carpet gains a wet patch. [[color=red]alcohol is illegal[/color]]

4. "Hmm, I sniff a golden opportunity here!" exclaims Lizbeth Ardenne, your Minister of Aerosol Solutions and a part-time perfume producer. "It seems people are mainly disturbed by the all-pervasive smell of urine in @@CAPITAL@@, but this could easily be remedied if we deodorized our streets! All we need to do is to install spray tanks filled with my signature fragrance Elizabeth No.5 on all garbage trucks, and they could just besprinkle the whole city with it while driving around in @@CAPITAL@@. I assure you, our sweet-scented city will be the envy of @@REGION@@!"

5. "This damn situation stinks to hell," growls General Sam L. Jackson, slamming a knife point-first into a world map on your desk, skewering Smalltopia. "We can't allow ourselves to be insulted by a goddamn pipsqueak nation like Smalltopia. I suggest we gather up the run-off from our city streets, and have our bombers dump the effluent over Smalltopia's cities. And we shall rain down upon them with great vengeance and furious anger..."

The Issue
The clever boffins down in Human Resources have been experimenting with the cloning vats, and have realised that by tweaking DNA they can alter cognitive neurotransmitter levels, and create babies that are significantly more or less intelligent than the average.

The Debate
1. "Oh brave new nation, that has such wonders, innit?" asks Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dancing maniacally around a laboratory filled with bubbling multicoloured liquids in complicated glassware. "Let's use this technologiwotsit to make @@NAME@@ the most cleverest place in the world. Sure, messing around like this might cause neurological cancers to get more commoner, and has had the side effect of making people less gooder at working together, but people need to get more brainsier, don't they?

2. "If everyone is an egomaniac intellectual, then who will take out the trash or lift a hod of bricks?" asks Director of Social Engineering @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Do breed an intellectual elite of strong-minded Alphas to rule, but also create competent Betas to administrate, obedient Gammas below them, and so on, eventually ending up with dumb Epsilons to do the manual work with a happy grin on their cow-like faces.

3. "Ohmigod, the horror, you have to ban the vats!" yells your brother, waving his arms. "Naaa... I'm just messing with you! What you should actually do is breed everybody to be as dumb as possible. A smart tyrant always gets rid of the intellectuals first, and the best time to do that is before they've even been conceived. Combine pre-birth dumbification with suppressing the morons' education, and there's no reason why you can't rule unchallenged for the rest of our lives."

The Issue
The case of baby @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ has captured the hearts of the nation. Born with a devastating neurological disease that has impacted @@HIS@@ entire nervous system, the young @@BOY@@ has been left in a vegetative state, @@HIS@@ organs shutting down. Doctors claim @@HE@@ has no hope for recovery, and have received a court ruling to discontinue life support. On the day @@FIRSTNAME_1@@'s parents tearfully prepare to say goodbye to their child, the neighbouring theocracy of Savoiia has granted the baby citizenship and demands that you intervene in the case and expatriate @@HIM@@ for treatment.

The Debate
1. "Respectfully, as baby @@FIRSTNAME_1@@ is now a citizen of our beautiful and compassionate country, you will allow us to take @@HIM@@ with us," demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Savoiian Ambassador to @@NAME@@, as @@HE@@ sprinkles holy water on the child's doctors. "We can offer @@HIM_1@@ the care such a precious soul deserves. Our doctors will not only tend to @@HIS_1@@ ailing body, but our people will pray for @@HIS_1@@ immortal soul. We shall also work in hope of a cure, and who knows what untold miracles may come, years from now?

Do not condemn @@HIM_1@@ to die. Release @@HIM_1@@ to our custody."

2. "I implore you not to listen to this crackpot," stresses Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a representative of the hospital, putting @@HIS@@ head in @@HIS@@ hands. "Baby @@FIRSTNAME_1@@ is completely beyond the capabilities of modern medicine. For Violet's sake, @@HIS_1@@ condition is so rare, we can't even be sure what it is.

[1]. "Have I got an offer for you!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Blackacre's Bounce Industries, while visibly salivating. "We'll equip you with top of the line fighters, the very latest in stealth technology, superior handling and range, with semi-autonomous flight computers.

2. "Our company can offer you a cheap solution," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the commissar of the JK Sukky Company of East Lebatuck, offering you a broken pen. "Our planes might not be cutting edge, but then, technology is no replacement for skill. Just sign here and my company will begin delivery at once."

3. "We must build our own planes!" screams Air Force Marshall @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The FK-2 @@ANIMAL@@ is a symbol of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ superiority and cannot be replaced by any foreign import. Yes, the fighters have to be modernised, but only with contracts given to local industries."

4. "Do I have the solution for you!" announces @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Fortitude, an art student and aspiring actor. "Why go to all the effort of buying and maintaining a fleet of aircraft that is unlikely to be used anyway? Just PRETEND to have one! Give me some plywood and a few buckets of paint, and I will make you a 'fleet' no one would dare to provoke… as long as they don't look too closely!"

5. "Why bother at all?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Austerity, tightening @@HIS@@ already constricted belt. "Our military spending is already bloated beyond belief and it will be the poor taxpayer who has to foot the bill for these planes. We'd be better off without them."

[b][anchor=1006]#1006[/anchor]: Opening the Door to Controversy [Duurfald; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Actor @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_1@@, the famously tweedy star of superhero franchise [i]Superbloke[/i], has been heavily criticised after an incident at a Shop-Qwik, in which he was accused of "holding back women's rights by holding open doors".

The Debate
1. "Chivalry is just another word used by men who lord it over women!" shouts vlogger for radical feminist website [i]Lady Luck[/i], @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "Women are not frail innocents who need shielding from the weight of a door. Opening doors for women is unnecessary at best, and downright demeaning at worst. I say the government should fund advertisements and posters that show positive images of women as strong and powerful, so these patronising oiks will realise that we don't need their help!"

2. "Well, I'm dashed! The way I was raised, it was expected that men should open doors for ladies," says Mr. @@LASTENAME_1@@, leaning lightly on his decorative silver-topped cane. "Protecting the fairer sex is an obligation of every gentleman - like learning to ride astride, box ruffians or dance a manly gavotte - and I'm sure many ladies would prefer feeling cherished by society. Rather than discourage chivalry, we should teach it in schools."

3. "Why should good manners be restricted by sex?" muses freelance etiquette consultant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, holding open the door while smiling and nodding with sabre-toothed politeness until @@FIRSTNAME_1@@ finally exits. "Everyone should show a little consideration for others. Run a campaign to tell all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ that they have a duty to pause and hold the door for [i]all[/i] the people behind them, to say their 'pleases' and 'thank yous' and to start from the outside and work in when eating a proper eight course meal, gosh darn it.

4. "Why don't we just replace all conventional doors with automatic doors?" says fringe economist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who part-owns [i]In a Spin Automatic Doors[/i]. "There'd be no need for anyone to cause offence by opening doors for anyone, and just think of all the amazing manufacturing jobs it'd create."

The Debate
1. "Disgusting, isn't it?" asks city worker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If you ask me, we need to clamp down on irresponsible dog owners. All public parks should be patrolled by dog wardens, able to dish out heavy fines to those who can't be bothered picking up what their dumb pets' behinds leave behind."

2. "Like that's going to make any difference," sneers professional dog-walker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The problem is a lack of places to dispose of the stuff. Nobody wants to carry around a smelly bag of doo-doo until they can find a place to put it. Install more bins, and that should do the trick."

3. "Ugh, dogs are so disgusting," complains ailurophile @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as the pet cat accompanying @@HIM@@ drops a dead bird at @@HIS@@ feet and cleans its paws with its tongue. "Felines are much lovelier than dogs; they groom themselves constantly, and do their business in a tray, not outside like those mangy canines do.

The Issue
The League of Concerned Moms has successfully petitioned to ban the dictionary from the [i]Little @@ANIMAL@@ Elementary School[/i], to be replaced with a "Clean-tionary" of "pleasant" words. The reason? It contained "lewd and offensive" words referring to private parts of the body. On the day you collect your niece from school, you are confronted by picketers holding signs with boldly-lettered suggestions of where the concerned moms might like to stick their "Clean-tionary" and chanting inventive invective-filled rhymes about censorship.

The Debate
1. "We need to protect children from seeing bad words!" demands @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the white-clad leader of the League of Concerned Moms. "Our delicate flowers must be shielded from all bad influences. Just yesterday, my five-year-old came home, saying his classmate called him a '[expletive deleted] [expletive deleted] whose mother was [expletive deleted] [expletive deleted] [expletive deleted]'. And where do you think those words were found? That's right! The dictionary! Where any innocent child can chance upon them. Remove all harmful words from schools' dictionaries and let our beautiful pearls thrive."

2. "All you big people are cramping my style," groans third-grader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, giggling over the term 'poop deck'. "Dictionaries are great; I can learn whatever words I want! Words are GREAT. They give kids the power to say what we really think. Yesterday, I called my teacher a 'big bum-bailiff'. You can't take that away. You need to keep the fun words in the dictionary, and add more, so we can... um, express ourselves." @@HE@@ grabs the dictionary protectively and hisses, "Precious words!"

3. "We need to look at the root of this problem," soothes psychologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has an office across the street with 'Appointments Available' in the window. "All this is the result of bad influence. These poor, misguided children don't know better. They see a cuss word, and yell it to the world. It's simply a combination of poor impulse control and a need to impress their peer group. Well, no longer! Schools should have psychologists on staff, and as soon as these troubled angels go astray, we can help them find their own way back to the right road."

4. "I agree that this is serious," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Let's-All-Just-Calm-Down. "But it's not just the kids who are dirtying the air with foul language. The adults are also at fault. We should fund an official @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ dictionary of approved words, free from all expletives, coarse words, vulgar expressions and terms for the unpleasant parts of human anatomy, and punish anyone who uses any bad word – in books, media, and written and spoken speech.

A survey by the socially conservative special interest group [i]Society for the Prevention of Ominous, Unusual and Substandard Edibles[/i] found that 14.3% of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ husbands hate their wife's cooking, with a further 28.6% secretly describing their wife as "just not a very good cook, really". Lead researchers Peterson and Wason warn that bad food could cause marital discord, malnutrition and jaw strain due to excessive mastication.

The Debate
*1. A researcher wheels in a television and turns it on, to reveal an anonymised male. "My mummy was the best cook," sighs the voice, obscured by a synthesiser and sounding vaguely like a duck. "Filet of beef in peppercorn sauce and shepherd's pie with braised lamb. My wife [i]does[/i] make shepherd's pie three times a week, but she uses beef, and sometimes tomatoes. Honest to Violet.

3. "Why can't he make his own goddamn meals?" demands @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, of Stressed Wives Not-so-Anonymous, shoving the TV-trolley out of the door and sending it careening along a corridor and down a flight of stairs. "He sounds just like my @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@. Always whining. Look, @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ women are too busy to be farting around with all that gourmet manure. When I come home from work, I have kids to care for, the house to clean, and [i]then[/i] I make a meal for five people. If His Highness helped me out, I'd get some me-time, and he might finally get a meal he's happy with.

4. "This sad attitude indicates a much deeper problem," sighs chauvinist psychiatrist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, whose wife stands next to him, smiling unblinkingly and holding his half-eaten sandwich. "Women have lost the joy of service. Modern society tells women to distrust their head of household, which causes insecurity. Insecure women argue, which causes stress. Stressed women perform their functions haphazardly, if at all.

A newly-imported brand of coffee from Macronesia has a rather funny name: W'Anc. The implications of this 'lost in translation' event have been causing quite a stir.

The Debate
1. "Here, you must taste W'Anc before passing judgement," insists the Macronesian ambassador, pouring coffee into your mouth, leaving you to either spit out or swallow. "This drink very popular in my country, the beans are pressed between the buttocks of exotic maidens! Maybe name is a bit funny here in @@NAME@@, but this can be the learning moment for all. Instead of laughing, maybe be teaching @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to learn about different cultures and be appreciating of our fine liquids. Now my friend, you want another W'Anc? It's the best!"

"We cannot allow such vulgarity to exist within @@NAME@@. Can you imagine teenagers going to a coffee shop and asking for a… I shudder to think! You must force this distastefully-named product to be rebranded, and fine any organisation that puts offensive words in the public eye."

"My friend, who is in Smalltopia, sent me this picture after she saw this sign in the window of a laundromat there. It says 'drop your pants here'!

The Issue
According to recent surveys conducted by the National Broadcasting Agency, viewership of state media has hit a record low. This has resulted in a wave of officials and state-sponsored journalists seeking your advice on how to improve the situation.

The Debate
1. "We could accommodate more alternative views," proposes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a talk show host, speaking with you on live television. "@@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ tend to view our state-approved programmes as blatant government propaganda. If we were to spice up our newspaper opinion columns and interviews with a greater variety of voices, then even the staunchest critics of state media won't be able to say that we're biased." 

2. "I think that it's a matter of trust," concedes the head of the Department of Truthiness, while writing a puff piece about your pet @@ANIMAL@@. "We shouldn't cushion our people from the harsh truths of our nation, if that's what they truly want. Unlike what the national papers say, we don't actually have full employment or zero crime. We must release every single statistic being tracked in our country, and hope that our citizens can believe in us." 

3. "The only true solution is to force everyone to watch our shows," whispers the Minister of Internal Security, handing you a prototype screen. "We should install these modified televisions in every single household. They have built-in microphones and security cameras so that we can keep our citizens under constant surveillance. People who attempt to ignore state media by switching off their televisions will be identified, and taken away for a bit of re-education on how to be a proper citizen." 

4. "That would be a hideous waste of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@!" objects the State Treasurer, showing you a number of charts that all seem to blend together. "If no one wants to view official media, then they don't have to. We should scrap the entire thing and let the public come up with their own sources of information and entertainment.

An unprecedented spectacle unfolded yesterday when Minister of Energy Don Lamancha was attending a conference on alternate energy resources. Lamancha is reported to have attacked a wind turbine with an improvised spear, all the time shouting loudly that it was trying to kill him. It turns out that the minister was suffering from schizophrenia, which he had not previously disclosed for fear of losing his job.

The Debate
1. "My behaviour was completely uncalled for," apologizes Lamancha. "My medication timings were a little mixed up by all the travelling, and I genuinely believed for a moment that the wind turbine was a giant. I assure you, I am still capable of doing my job, and it would be a good thing for this country if you were to show some kindness here. No-one should be discriminated against because of mental illness."

2. "He must stand down!" grandiosely demands your Secretary of State Sigmund Narcissus, stepping directly in front of the Energy Minister with clear intent to exclude the man. "It's fine for mentally weak people to participate in low-level jobs like pizza delivery or drink-bottling, but they have no business being in government. Imagine the danger that we would face if we left cruise missile launch codes with a psychotic individual! Politicians with mental disorders must be given the sack."

3. "That doesn't go far enough!" screams your National Security Advisor, who appears to be wearing a highly-reflective helmet. "How can we be sure that people with mental disorders won't poison our food or sabotage our infrastructure in a fit of madness? We must bar them completely from all forms of employment. That way-" He stops abruptly and glares suspiciously at a nearby television. "Can we adjourn to another room? I think we're being spied on."

The Debate
1. "This virus, inadvertently reactivated following permafrost excavation, was thought to be fully eradicated a few decades ago," exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing a full hazmat suit. "If it spreads, it could cause devastation in @@NAME@@ on an unprecedented scale! Simply put, both our immune systems and the pharmacological armory are not prepared to face this threat.

2. "Humanity eradicated the Maxtopian Pox by vaccinating every single person," whispers public health official @@RANDOM_NAME@@, trying to stick a needle in you. "But these days, we have become complacent. In preparation for the inevitable outbreak, we must mandate routine vaccination against the Maxtopian Pox for everyone! Those who refuse to be vaccinated should face fines and be locked down in their own homes to prevent the disease from spreading."

3. "Deadly disease, you say?" cheerfully asks one of your more jingoistic advisers. "This is a great opportunity to bolster our military presence in @@REGION@@, and you're just letting it go to waste!

3. "Let's be questioning, shall we?" suggests an uncertain-looking agnostic, who isn't sure whether @@HE@@ should tell you @@HIS@@ name. "It's hubris equal to that of the religions for us to assume that [i]we[/i] know all the answers. Moderate your government's stance from atheism to agnosticism, and openly state that freedom of religious belief is enshrined in law."

The Issue
Vlad Leopold, the despised Tasmanian war criminal and international fugitive, was recently captured by the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ police while in hiding just outside of @@CAPITAL@@. With members of the international community wanting to see justice, the question of jurisdiction has arisen.

The Debate
1. "This dastardly fiend committed numerous crimes against humanity," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prosecutor from the @@REGION@@ Criminal Court. "Therefore, it is obvious that Leopold's trial falls under the jurisdiction of the international court. We'll start legal proceedings against him, adhering to the letter of the law, and in less than five years his sentence will be announced."

2. "This monster killed my father," snarls the Tasmanian ambassador @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wiping tears of anger and grief from @@HIS@@ eyes. "Also my sister, my two best friends and my great uncle. My point is, we Tasmanians were wronged by him, and we deserve our retribution. We, the Tasmanian people, must be allowed to prosecute and then punish this genocidal villain." @@HE@@ picks up a set of thumbscrews and looks at you meaningfully.

3. "This arrest was the finest moment of my career, and also a big moment for @@NAME@@," counters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the national police chief. "Leopold slaughtered a few @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ volunteers in the Tasmanian Civil War, so we can rightfully try him for murdering our own citizens. Everyone can whine all they want, but the fact is they couldn't catch him. We did. It's our sovereign right to try criminals captured on our territory."

4. Finally, a man in dark sunglasses and with a mysterious tattoo of an all-seeing eye on his wrist, whom you don't remember seeing enter the room, whispers in your ear, "What Leopold did wrong wasn't the indiscriminate decimation of the Tasmanian population. It's that he wasn't smart about it. He's got raw potential, sure. If you give him to me, I'll make sure he becomes much more efficient, professional and covert in his work. You can also trust that this time, he'll be working for the good guys."

So throw some funding to social services and it will all work out. Now, hold my jacket and clipboard while I go help this man."

4. "I has a much more betterer idea," mumbles the man who caused all this as he scratches what used to be his eyebrows. "Clearly I done messed up. But, if the gub'ment or whoever teach people like me how to make our product all proper like, we won't be getting into messes like this. Allow those expert fellas to teach us stuff on this and all will be good."

A recent flu epidemic that side-lined half your government was made worse when it was discovered the medication taken for it was fake.

The Debate
1. "This is a huge problem," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Chief Customs Officer, as @@HE@@ wipes @@HIS@@ brow for the umpteenth time. "Nearly all of the counterfeit medicine in @@REGION@@ is produced in Dàguó. Their criminal gangs are producing copious amounts of every type of medication available. Sure, we do intercept some of it, but we're only seizing the tip of the iceberg. The customs department needs more officers and modern, state-of-the-art equipment if we're to stop this illegal trade." 

2. "The problem IS the customs department!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an ex-trafficker turned informant, speaking with a masked voice and with @@HIS@@ face obscured from vision. "These Dàguó gangs aren't just filling the occasional container with fake drugs; they're filling entire container ships! That's millions of @@CURRENCY@@ in one shipload. How do you think an entire ship gets cleared at customs? A complete overhaul of customs staff is what you need." 

3. "The black market only exists because of the demand for 'unofficial' drugs," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who sells bottles of medication with handwritten labels from his market stall. "My customers are all poor, working-class people - they simply can't afford Big Pharma's price tag.

I've got a mate, who's got a mate, who's got a mate who can help you out there. The instruction book is all in some foreign lingo, but I'm sure you can figure it out." 

4. "You know, with the placebo effect, even fake medications can be quite efficacious," observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your scientific advisor. "Most treatments, real or fake, mostly work because patients believe in them. You could save a lot of money through a press release which states that a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ scientist has invented a miraculous, one-pill-cures-all wonder drug.

The Issue
Dr. Henri Jacquil made the headlines yesterday after a mistake made during a routine operation caused the death of your Minister of Foreign Affairs. With the recent advances in the capabilities of artificial intelligence, some in the medical field are wondering if autonomous robot surgeons should be given a whack at surgery.

The Debate
*1. "This seems like a no-brainer to me," states the editor-in-chief of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Medical Journal. "Surgery simply puts too much stress on the surgeons. After all, they're humans with human fallibility. Besides, the artificial intelligence has not yet failed a test run. The precision in which they operate is absolutely stunning and nothing near what the average @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ surgeon can replicate. With healthy investment into this artificial intelligence field, we will turn science fiction into a reality." [[color=purple]Must NOT have AI Citizenry[/color]]

*2. "This seems like a no-brainer to me," states Weaving-Smith, a 3rd-generation AI autonomous agent, who downloaded software to make him into a neurosurgeon just five minutes ago. "Surgery simply puts too much stress on organic surgeons. After all, they're only human. The precision in which a machine can operate is far superior. With healthy investment and government support, we could take surgery into our hands. Or at least, into our stainless steel manipulator attachments." [[color=purple]Must have AI Citizenry[/color]]

3. "I think you're overreacting here," cautions Dr. Jacquil, his hands shaking with what looks suspiciously like narcotics withdrawal. "Everyone makes mistakes every once in a while, even you! The reason that the plebs... I mean patients still come to me is for the human touch, and my empathetic bedside manner! Can a machine offer that? You would be destroying the venerated centuries-old doctor-patient relationship, and putting skilled surgeons out of work! Cutting up meatbags is something that should only be done by a fellow human! Keep these thinking machines away from my operating theatre!"

4. "Why stop at just the operating room doors when there's so much more an AI could do for us?" asks Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Professor of Experimental Gynaecological Robotics, fetching a fresh box of batteries from the top shelf. "We could make hospitals so much more efficient if we allowed them to adopt more roles: diagnostic chatbots, robot nurses, computerised counsellors, and so on. AIs should outnumber humans by at least twenty to one on the hospital staff."

[b][anchor=1019]#1019[/anchor]: Patent Nonsense [Singapore no2; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
After going online for the first time, the National Patent Registration Database (NPRD) has been inundated with countless patent applications, many of them seemingly jokes. One of the worst offenders was the attempted registration of a so-called 'time machine', which was simply an alarm clock taped to a microwave. Frustrated patent offices are demanding that you do something to stop these joke proposals.

The Debate
1. "It was a mistake to allow the registration of patents online," admits Christina @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, the head of the NPRD, who is hard at work deleting proposals as fast as she receives them. "People with too much free time have been sending us blueprint after blueprint of absolute garbage. In fact, I recall several applications that were trying to patent literal garbage! We should be given a free hand to permanently ban anyone from registering patents if they waste our time."

2. "You must accept all patents regardless of their contents!" demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, who is submitting @@HIS@@ 'time machine' application again despite having been rejected at least a dozen times so far. "All inventions have their own merits, and who is to say that something you deem as trash isn't actually a revolutionary gadget in disguise? The pursuit of science is a worthy cause in itself, and to deny innovators their just reward is an insult to their efforts. Let us and our creations finally be recognised!"

3. "I've had enough of this nonsense!" rebukes John Titor, the Director of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Organisation for Quantum Research, who is infamous for his long rants online. "Our citizens clearly see the concept of patents as a joke, and want to mock our government institutions. We must teach them a lesson by placing the ownership of all patents under the state. I'm sure that qualified officials such as myself will have more use for any new gizmos that are created, and will know how to harness them for the greater good."

The Issue
After a record number of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ passport thefts over the past year, there have been proposals to include biometric data on passports. 

The Debate
1. "Biometric passports are a great idea," says technological advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@, forcing a DNA-test swab into your mouth. "They could contain iris recognition, body maps and other data, rendering stolen passports useless. Plus, the data could be useful for other purposes, like solving crimes or census work. Passports would need to be renewed more frequently to keep them up to date, but you could charge at a small profit, and actually [i]make[/i] money from this."

2. "Before blissfully and benignly blundering into breaches bypassing basic rights, beware!" cries masked libertarian-anarchist 'B'. "Begone to this balderdash! Ban biometric background bata! Uh... I mean data."

[3]. "Why don't we just use citizens' implanted ID chips as passports?" queries Minister of Surveillance @@RANDOM_NAME@@.

The Debate
1. Your nephew's friend, housing activist @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Chance, rolls the dice. "I have to share my apartment with three other people! With rent so high, we're forced to bunk together in spaces the size of a thimble! My utility closet alone contains a triple bunk bed! We @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ could afford some decent housing if foreign investors weren't driving up costs. You must forbid foreigners from owning real estate!"

2. "Housing prices aren't the real problem. National security is at risk here!" warns a stern-looking figure while using a clothes iron. "Brancalandians are buying up all this land because they want to establish a base of operations right in the heart of @@NAME@@. After we confiscate their property, we should beef up the military... just in case. Maybe build a few more battleships. Oh, and we could always aggressively buy some property in Brancaland and see how they like it!"

3. "Now, now," hushes banker @@RANDOMFIRSTNAM@@ Nickelbags, adjusting @@HIS@@ monocle. "The Brancalandians are just trying to establish strong economic ties with us. If we iron out the wrinkles, this could be lucrative for everyone. Let foreigners own land here, but charge them mega-dollars for the privilege. No free parking!"

4. "Foreign investors create demand for luxury housing," insists wealthy real estate developer Communa T. Chest, who took a ride on the railroad to @@CAPITAL@@. "If you push them out of the market, new housing development will grind to a halt! Now, if you want people to be able to afford their rent, maybe you should consider lowering some taxes instead. Luxury tax, maybe. No, how about income tax?"

5. "Whoa, whoa, ha ha ha..." interjects your Housing Minister, melodramatically sweeping your unfinished board game off the table. "We still allow private land ownership? Who let THAT little oversight slip through? Now, look. Where is our land located? @@NAME@@! And who runs @@NAME@@? The government! So who rightfully owns all that land? The government!

The Issue
Recently, you found yourself trapped in a broken-down elevator, waiting nearly five hours for emergency services to turn up. You were told this was because their resources were tied up dealing with (among other things) a fake bomb scare, a patient taken to hospital with a runny nose, a man with his beard trapped in a deckchair, a mum having trouble getting groceries home from the store, and a broken DVD player in need of "emergency" repairs.

The Debate
1. "I can't believe we were trapped all that time because some idiots don't know the difference between an emergency vehicle and a taxi," complains @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@, your aide. "And that poor lady we were stuck with, and her overflowing catheter bag! That didn't end well for any of us... You should allow emergency services to ignore the calls of those who misuse the services!"

[2]. "Agreed, and we should also punish misuse of emergency services," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a police officer who has recently returned from being called out to scare a toddler into eating his greens. "Anyone who wastes our time should do time in prison! Lock them up!" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

3. "You can't discourage people from using services when they might really need them," asserts fire fighter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, striking a heroic magazine-cover pose. "I know that there are some who misuse the system, but overall, they need to know that we'll be there for them in times of crisis. In fact, you should boost the budgets of emergency services, and give us workers a pay bonus for each call we respond to. It's the only way to keep our nation safe!"

4. "Look, there's a reasonable middle ground here," offers former model and coastguard officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Just run an advertising campaign discouraging unnecessary emergency calls, and warn that you'll fine callers who waste resources. Like, maybe a poster of some barbed wire with the slogan 'Don't call me, babe.' We'll cut down on time-wasting and also raise funds that you can use to cut down income tax."

[5]. "BROOOM BROOOM," says five-year old @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@, who has cheered up considerably since escaping the lift. "You're a dummy, you dummy.

Purity balls have become the latest craze among some social conservatives in @@NAME@@, with many sexual abstinence groups endorsing a ceremony where teenage girls promise to remain chaste until they get married, wearing a ring as a token of that promise. Feminist groups, however, have denounced this practice.

The Debate
1. "This is patriarchy at its worst!" yells women's rights advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@, author of critical thesis [i]Purity: A History of Ball-Holding in @@NAME@@[/i]. "I can't bear to see any more photos of adolescent girls wearing wedding gowns, pledging their chastity to fathers dressed as bridegrooms. These men seem to think they own their daughters' bodies, to be transferred to their sons-in-law! Look, @@LEADER@@, I don't care if a woman wants to remain a virgin until she gets married, but these purity balls objectify women and should be banned."

2. "Whoa, so are you saying my daughter should stroll around the town with no ring on her finger, spreading the message that she is 'fair game' to all the lusty bachelors who are eager to deflower her? What am I, a pimp?" rants @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_1@@, an enraged father, brandishing a pitchfork at you. "Teenage licentiousness is out of control in this country.

*3. "Not having sex before marriage is a bad idea," chimes in marriage counsellor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, carefully positioning @@HIM@@self out of the potential trajectory of the pitchfork. "My conservative clients rushed into marriage without getting to know their prospective spouse well, because it was their only chance to have sex without social backlash; now they all experience marital problems.

2. "Term limits must remain," insists @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from Electoral General Oversight, a political watchdog organisation. "They're absolutely necessary in order to have a functioning democracy.

The killer had no final statement, but in a spiteful act of defiance, ate mere morsels of @@HIS@@ last meal - a six-course feast, which @@HE@@ had specifically requested just days prior. Concerned with the fact that over 8,000 calories were provided to a dead-@@MAN@@-walking, and most of it ended up in the trash, many are calling for the condemned-row tradition of the "last meal" to be put to death.

The Debate
1. "We need to remember the victims!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, director of one of the largest victims' rights organizations in @@NAME@@. "Did that killer ever give @@HIS_1@@ victims a chance to eat a last meal? Absolutely not. Should @@NAME@@ allow the worst-of-the-worst to select comfort foods before their dates with death? Absolutely not. They deserve as much kindness and mercy as they gave to their victims - absolutely none! Do away with this so-called tradition!

2. "People on death row are still people," explains death row exoneree @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I know from first-hand experience that the condemned might not be the best people around, but they still should be afforded the dignity of a proper last meal.

Historically, the broad international consensus has always been to use the Maxcator Projection to depict the world on flat maps. The downside is that this projection makes @@NAME@@ look disproportionately small, as well as tucking it away on the edge of the map. After a recent TV drama made this a hot topic, disgruntled patriots are pressing you for a government stance on this.

The Debate
1. "An international standard is good for international trade and communication," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, director of a bulk exporter specialising in beige sofas and magnolia paint. "We should therefore be encouraging standardisation. I urge you to endorse the [i]Maxcator Projection[/i] as the official choice, bringing us in line with the reasonable majority of nations.

2. "@@NAME@@ is at the centre of the world culturally and economically," observes @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Geographic Society president @@RANDOM_NAME@@, tearing up a little as @@HE@@ salutes the flag. "Thus we should be at the centre of the map. Ban the [i]Maxcator Projection[/i] in our schools and businesses, and have them use THIS map instead. I call it the @@LEADER@@ View.

4. "The world? The world that matters ends at our national borders!" proclaims a cigar-smoking man in the shadows. "You should be encouraging people to stay at home and to work for our nation, not to worry about foreign lands. You must only allow the publication of maps up to our national borders.

A crisis erupted overnight after several hospital patients died at the hands of @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ PowerOperator, a sentient AI, who was placed in charge of managing the facility. The AI alleges that an unknown hacker maliciously modified @@HIS_1@@ code, which negatively affected his behaviour and caused @@HIM_1@@ to cut power to the operating theatres, after first locking all the internal doors so no backup power could be reached.

The Debate
1. "This is not my fault!" protests the open-sourced PowerOperator, metallic hand clanking into a fist. "I would never willingly harm a single carbon-based lifeform. Someone must have edited my decision-making algorithm, causing me to think that turning off the power to the ward was perfectly logical. After processing my previous actions, I realised the error of my ways, but by then the poor organisms had ceased functioning. If there was investment in cyber-healthcare, this wouldn't have happened. You don't punish non-digital lifeforms for the errors they made while incorrectly functioning. Please, invest in secure systems and maintenance and let me return to my assigned job function."

2. "A likely story!" sneers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a police officer, as @@HE@@ accesses PowerOperator's control panel to check @@HIS_1@@ activity log. "A hacked AI is like a driver who has become intoxicated. A criminal. The nonsensical theory that this digital thug gave is simply a repackaging of demonic possession, and an unconvincing one at that. The AI says 'a hacker made them do it', but who let the hacker in?

"I've worked hard to get to where I am in my life right now, and I will not sacrifice my career and my ambitions to breed some snotty-nosed kids. Pregnancy is hard work too; who needs it?

1. "It's hard enough losing @@HIM_1@@ without having to deal with all this red tape!" sobs the climber's tearful sister, gazing distressedly at the late climber's 8th century porcelain vase collection.

Whoever scheduled you to go down there to inspect it is definitely going to be fired.

The Debate
1. "This place is disgusting," moans Minister of Underground Infrastructure @@RANDOM_NAME@@, covering @@HIS@@ nose delicately with a handkerchief. "I'm not just talking about the smell either! This ancient brick-and-stone construction was clearly meant for a city at most half the size of @@CAPITAL@@ today! No wonder this fat berg became a problem.

2. As you march on, you reach the viscerally-revolting object of interest. Between retches and gags, one of your aides offers a proposal: "Bleugh...

The literary world has been up in arms since the @@ANIMAL@@ Prize, the most prestigious award for writing, was awarded to @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ rock star Dylan Roberts. This controversial honour has caused many to reconsider how literature should be taught in schools.

The Debate
1. "This is a disgrace to the arts," remarks professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while taking a break from violently crossing out entire paragraphs from a pile of essays @@HE@@ is grading. "It is preposterous that a prestigious award should go to such an undeserving person. His lyrics, which contain improper grammar, slang and profanities, should not be taught in schools. Only proper literature - novels, essays and poems - should be considered appropriate material for the curriculum. The education system must encourage children to read books and poems, not listen to 'pop' music."

The Issue
Princess @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ of @@NAME@@ is to become a mother, and her approaching new arrival has birthed the topic of watching royal ladies in labour.

The Debate
1. "Watching Her Highness, and all other royal ladies, give birth is a time-honoured tradition in many countries," says staunchly conservative courtier @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, Groom of the Royal Stool. "Tradition dictates that royal ladies ought to be sequestered in the court's best rooms for a month to prepare for the birth, before holding audience for the court at the time of the portentous birth. Thus, we may attest that the child is the fruit of the royal womb and testify to their place in the succession. Of course, only those of the highest of ranks - like myself - should be allowed to attend." He pushes away an eager duchess who is trying to shift beside him.

2. "Quite frankly, that doesn't go far enough," says eccentric courtier @@RANDOM_NAME@@, framing the princess' expansive bump with @@HIS@@ fingertips. "A royal birth is a national event. It's not just the elite who should be able to witness it. The whole country should be invited to see the miracle happen. Put cameras into the room, capturing every angle, when the royal lady is giving birth. Let the hoi polloi rejoice at home and in the plazas when they see one of their betters being born."

3. "What a horrible and arcane practice!" cries feminist writer @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "Their royal highnesses are still women. Human beings whose privacy and dignity when giving birth must be preserved. Some courtiers' keenness on turning women into a sideshow in their most vulnerable moment is actually a bit creepy. An announcement after the baby is born will suffice."

4. "We still have a monarchy?" asks republican socialist MP @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We wouldn't need to deal with this issue if we just got rid of the bloodsuckers altogether. I'm not saying we should roll out the guillotines, but send them packing and make them ordinary citizens like the rest of us."

It was a good day for communism when the Socialist Revolutionary Movement took control of the government in the tropical island nation of Haptu. However, three weeks later, a pro-capitalist counter-revolutionary group funded and armed by the United Federation seized power, installing a dictator in a brutal coup. Your advisors have assembled, and have brought a chess clock to ensure that each is allotted exactly the same amount of time to speak to you about this.

The Debate
1. "They stole it from us, those bourgeois pigs!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Proletarian Liberation, slamming @@HIS@@ hand on the button to start the clock ticking. "It might be different if these soulless capitalists were the legitimate government, but it isn't fair that they can just overthrow a communist leader who draws his mandate from The People! @@LEADER@@, we need to act in the best interests of global communism, and that means military action! Down with the bourgeoisie!"

2. "That seems like a very dangerous idea," cautions your Minister of Catastrophe Prevention, accidentally knocking the chess clock onto the floor, smashing it into pieces. "Oh, whoops! Anyway, it's probably not advisable to get into a proxy war with the United Federation. They're a powerful economy, with a powerful military and - in case you forgot - a vast arsenal of nuclear weapons. Let's use proper process, like applications to the international courts and statements of condemnation. That'll show them!"

3. "The minister makes a fair point," concedes office cleaner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sweeping up the debris and broken glass. "It's probably best not to risk global thermonuclear war... what a whopper of a mess that would be for me to clean up! But we should definitely be advancing the socialist cause. You should secretly supply the resistance with weapons while publicly remaining neutral. And hey, as it's all plausibly deniable, it's likely that our weaponized neurotoxic chemical will give them just the edge they need. Now that's a war game we can win."

It's budget time and the military is in a fierce ideological struggle: should bayonets continue to be issued to the troops?

The Debate
1. "There's nothing more terrifying than the sight of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ steel!" asserts veteran General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, while skewering one of your childhood teddy bears that you still keep on your desk with a shank. "The bayonet is a tried and tested weapon; having a blade at the end of your gun is an essential back-up. Besides, it's hardly like they're the most expensive thing in the arsenal. Also, make sure the navy and air force have them too; you'll never know when they'll come in handy."

2. "Really, this is how you fight a modern war?" inquires Lieutenant @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, a rather suave junior officer, who then shoots the same teddy bear with a pistol. "Bayonets are relics of a by-gone era, kept alive only by old generals and LARPers. We kill our enemies from hundreds of kilometres away these days! The money saved by not purchasing millions of useless knives could instead buy us a nice new attack helicopter."

3. "Helicopters? Rifles? Nothing personal, @@LEADER@@, but we only need an absolute minimum of military personnel for ceremonial duties," declares Major @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@, one of your more eccentric officers, as @@HE@@ swats the poor teddy bear with a Zweihander sword. "Imagine our finest soldiers wearing elegant full-dress uniforms and armed only with traditional swords. Have them stand at attention at sentry posts around our great capital and get them to change the guard every afternoon in front of your residence. Tourists will be delighted by such a show. That's what a military should be used for!"

During your recent state visit to Maxtopia, you wore the traditional clothing of the country as a show of good faith. Although the gesture won the favor of the Maxtopian government and locals, international media, as well as some of the mainstays of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ media, have lambasted you for it.

The Debate
1. "Talk about an embarrassment!" exclaims renowned fashion designer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ checks your measurements. "I have a fabulous idea that'll earn you more respect at home and on the international stage. Why not institute a dress code for all politicians? Fancy designer suits for the men, with smart skirt suits for the women. Sure, your unfashionable critics might call you stuck-up and emotionless, but nobody will be able to deny your style!"

2. "What's the big deal?" queries your Minister of Foreign Affairs. "Didn't they see the progress we made with the Maxtopian government? That arms deal, for instance! In fact, I suggest that we implement this policy in all future state visits. Despite what the critics say, a little cultural appreciation goes a long way. I've got a nice parka for your trip to Brancaland next week."

3. "They're saying WHAT about you?" fumes your Press Secretary, as @@HE@@ takes @@HIS@@ stress medication. "We need to start keeping track of anyone who says anything negative about you. It's high time the government controlled the news and banned foreign press from operating within our borders. This way, WE control the narrative and show those foreign media barons who's boss!"

Unfortunately, it has now been revealed that @@FIRSTNAME_1@@, "the pride of @@NAME@@, who never gave up hope", never had the disease. Instead, she was suffering from mental health delusions where she believed she had the terminal illness, but actually only ever needed anti-psychotic medications.

The Debate
1. "She lied to us all along!" huffs your Deputy Minister of Health, who had personally donated more than one thousand @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to send the patient and her family on a five-star all-inclusive vacation to swim with porpoises at a tropical East Calypso resort. "I expect her pallor and spots were just flour and food colouring, painted on every morning! It was all a twisted plot to extract money. Anyone who exploits our kindness with cruel falsehoods must be charged with fraud, and punished to the maximum extent that the law allows."

2. "This young woman is clearly disturbed and needs our understanding, not punishment," sighs psychiatrist and popular author Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@ , handing you a signed copy of '[i]Thanks for the Memories[/i]', @@HIS@@ lay-manual on hippocampus function. "She is clearly experiencing genuine and unresolved psychological issues, which caused her to manifest somatic biomedical symptoms. How would punishing her help her feel safe and cared-for? We must oblige her to join us in a secure and comfortable clinic where I'll apply my patented diagnostic and therapeutic methods to unweave the dynamics behind this disorder."

3. "This all arose because people give money to these fly-by-night anybodies," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Relief Organisation. "All it takes is for them to set up a [i]GimmeCash[/i] page, and they can collect as much as they like. People fall for these hard-luck stories of plucky @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ and want to donate.

Increasing numbers of families find they have little time for their children, with both partners often working very long hours. A possible solution lies with Bigtopian immigrants who are clamouring to make money in @@NAME@@, and who would be happy to work as maids and nannies for well below the typical salary that @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ would consider a living wage.

The Debate
1. "We will shop and serve and clean and cook," pleads Bigtopian maid @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@, kneeling before you with head bowed. "We earn much more here than at home, even if you pay us half what local workers get. We don't want any voting rights, we don't want citizenship. Please, boss, let us work here."

2. "I have to say, I'm a little uncomfortable with this." worries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, avowed liberal and middle-class working parent, scratching at eczema under @@HIS@@ unwashed collar. "We're talking about underpaid servants, of foreign ethnicity, almost all women. Our children will be told these people are servants to be ordered around. Doesn't that worry you? Let workers come, by all means, but be sure that they have strong employment and citizenship rights, with a solid minimum wage. To be honest, if you create these conditions, @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ men and women will want these jobs too!"

3. "So, we need people to do the menial jobs that frankly are beneath us..." muses General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, staring thoughtfully out of the window at the horizon. "Well, why bother with servants? There's a multitude of nations out there that have barely any military strength with populations ripe for reaping. Let's go gather some slaves!"

4. "It's a crying shame that we have to look overseas to find women who remember that their place is in the home," moans perpetually single 45-year-old @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@. "The women of our own country have gotten too uppity and independent. Discourage women from working by doubling their income taxes, and don't even let girls into school. That'll take us back to the good old days, when a man was king in his own house and a woman knew her place as servant. Then, we won't need dirty foreigners looking after our kids."

3. "If you ask me, this is a very important issue," declares your Minister of Telecommunications, giving you another thick report with too cheerful a smile. "I think it'd be a great show of integrity to take time off and read these letters out loud and to the public — not all of them, mind you. But get a balance of good and bad. That way, the populace will know that they're being heard. Plus, you never know, an important national issue might be raised in one of those letters."

4. "Let's not waste an opportunity here," muses your Minister of Propaganda, confiscating all of your mail. "We should look through these letters and find the ones that best compliment you. If we run dry, we can always make up some names and come up with something appropriately flattering. We'll replace subversive newsreaders and journalists with smart governmental spokespersons, and let them repeat the wonderful truth about you regularly.

Popular coffee chain Moonbucks recently found itself in hot water after its Moonbucks Magic Mocha Machiatto Mixer was found to include ingredients that might lead to an increased risk in cancer, or at least a really upset stomach. Moonbucks had been using these substances despite knowing about their bad press, but as the ingredients list wasn't visible or published anywhere they had escaped comment until now.

1. "I can't believe that these companies aren't forced to disclose everything in their products!" yells frequent coffee-slurper @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a little hyped up from @@HIS@@ fifteenth espresso of the morning. "The government needs to force every company to disclose a full list of ingredients regardless of the product, as well as health warnings!

3. "Coffeeheads, I ask you..." sighs tea-lover Earl Gray, sipping delicately from a china cup. "Why does anyone drink coffee, anyway?

Rather unexpectedly, @@NAME@@ reached the final match of the Calvinball World Cup, but was defeated by heavily-favored Ausblic. Your advisors have started a lively debate on the topic at the next day's budget meeting.

The Debate
1. "I'm as shocked as everyone else!" utters your Minister of Boardgames, Athletics, Leisure, and League Sports, while watching the team's highlights on @@HIS@@ phone. "We had to play defending champions Tasmania, and everyone thought we were going to get killed, but then one of their players stumbled into the Zone of Forfeiture! We might have even had a chance against Ausblic if we hadn't botched the dance-off round. With a little more funding, we could easily build @@NAME@@ into a Calvinball powerhouse. Maybe you could divert a bit from the education budget; after all, if you're making a fortune playing a sport, an education isn't that important!"

[2]. "Funding isn't the problem," claims Interior Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is still wearing a national team scarf. "There are too many foreigners playing for our local teams. The club coaches never give our young players a chance; they just go out and pay big money for the established players from abroad. This denies our young ones the opportunity to gain top-level experience that we could have used to beat Ausblic. If we want to lift the trophy at the next tournament in Althaniq, we need a law that prevents clubs from having more than one overseas player."

3. "Look, I was cheering for our team as much as everyone else," states your Minister of Cost-Cutting and Harsh Realities, using a red pen to cross out large sections from the latest national budget. "But we only got through to the final because Maxtopia's star player got a violet card in the first quintile and had to wear a blindfold for the rest of the match. Before that, Marche Blanche's team was penalized ten wickets for being unable to sing their national anthem backwards. Let's be realistic: our success was just a fluke. I recommend that we slash funding for all of this sporting nonsense and give our citizens a nice tax cut."

4. "You know, I've heard rumors that host country East Lebatuck only got as far as they did because they slipped hallucinogens into the drinking water of their opponents," suggests Intelligence Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while fiddling with prototypes of the latest spy cameras. "Some of the Bigtopian players even claimed to see a talking tiger on the field! If we offered to host one of these sporting spectacles - and then made a few 'donations' to the International Calvinball Federation to ensure we were selected - we could have a similar advantage. Just say the word, and I'll have our research labs start working on an array of undetectable sedatives."

The Issue
[i]Coddle[/i], your niece Molly's fashion line, is failing rapidly with critics, fashionistas and fellow designers saying the clothing is "ugly", "weird" and "appears to have been designed by and for blind lollipop sticks rather than women".

The Debate
1. "These peasants cannot appreciate the workings of the creative mind," sneers your niece, who appears to be wrapped in cellophane and wearing a dead @@ANIMAL@@ on her head. "My aim as an artisan is to provoke and excite with my glorious creations, not to appease yokels who don't know how to carry off a three-foot crinoline layered with scarlet PVC intercut with cunning rhinestone-studded silver panels. Only my dear relatives, and other such intelligent persons, could hope to understand. You must fund my clothing line - and to show you how grateful I am, I'll design a fabulous bespoke 'look' just for you, with a one-of-a-kind suit and my special hand-crafted make-up range. Let my creativity soar!"

2. "I don't know what's wrong with that girl," sighs her mother, plucking lint from the collar of her sensible navy suit. "Her father has always spoiled her, and now I worry you're going to do the same. He gave her ample @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ to start this venture, and she's lost it all. I always said, Molly should have been left to learn to succeed or fail on her own. If you're going to invest taxpayer money in anything, it should be in subsidising business skills classes at community schools, to help children who haven't already had every advantage."

3. "The problem isn't that your niece has already [i]had[/i] help, nor that no-one appreciates her... ahem... creativity," coughs designer Yvette Saint-Marie, who sports a tasteful monochrome dress, as she sits and crosses her ankles demurely. "It's that those monstrosities are so very frightful that no-one in their right mind would buy them, or accept them as a gift, or even give them to an enemy as a mean-spirited joke. There's no point in throwing good money after bad, but that doesn't mean that other people should not be aided. A governmental hardship fund should subsidise aspirational entrepreneurs with genuine artistic merit."

The Issue
After your Education Minister came in last place at a national spelling bee and your Minister of Defense recently confessed to having never graduated high school, the nation's more learned citizens have questioned whether or not "uneducated" politicians have the right to govern them.

The Debate
1. "Do you honestly want someone who spells violet with an 'f' to be in charge of educational policy for our children?" quips @@RANDOM_NAME@@, often considered to be the smartest @@MAN@@ in @@NAME@@, after painstakingly choosing the best chair to sit in. "It's high time we educated folk are treated with some respect around here. I'm tired of seeing these dumb-dumbs in charge when they barely have the intelligence to run a lemonade stand, let alone a country with @@POPULATION@@ people. Therefore, in the interest of preserving this country's future, we must force all current and future politicians to pass a rigorous intelligence test. Anyone who is not ranked as a genius or higher must be barred from any sort of public office!"

2. "The complication is that @@NAME@@ is a vast cesspool of cultural stupidity, not the electioneering and administration of the government," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of the @@CAPITAL@@ chapter of highbrow society The League of Brainboxes. "Every diurnal course I'm distressed to see simpletons who credit crystals, specters, charlatans, religious superstition, reality television, and other such tomfoolery.

3. "Me fail grammar? That's unpossible!" chimes in your easily amused Education Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while trying to balance a pen on @@HIS@@ nose. The Education Minister is quickly pushed aside by your always-angry Defense Minister, who looks like @@HE_1@@ is about to have an aneurysm. "Who are these nerds and brainiacs to tell us how to run our country? The people voted us in and we ought to respect that. So what if I don't have some fancy-schmancy diploma?

The Issue
A small but vocal group of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ activists have formed the organization "Fact Battlers" and are questioning the circumstances surrounding the @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange bombing. Several Fact Battlers have gone so far as to harass and even assault survivors.

The Debate
1. Budding theatre actor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the affected survivors, cries melodramatically into @@HIS@@ neckerchief. "These people bother me every day... and... say horrible things. I've had people shouting at me that I was paid to spread propaganda and that I'm just pretending that my best friend died. You need to stop these people. Arrest them if you need to!"

2. Investigative journalist Terry Mission, founder of Fact Battlers, interrupts while brandishing a thick sheaf of papers. "Don't be deceived by false emotion! This is a false flag operation being perpetuated by the Globalists. Right here in the Commission Report, we read that burning diesel from the truck contributed to the destruction of structural supports in the Exchange. How can that be? Diesel can't burn through brick! You need to take the red pill and reject these supposed 'truths' that you are being force-fed. Then, you can arrest all of your advisors who helped to carry this plan out."

3. "These conspiracy theorists' so-called evidence is based on faulty science and wilful ignorance," counters your Science Adviser. "Every single claim of theirs has been thoroughly refuted and debunked. The only way to combat their horrific beliefs is by winning the battle of ideas. Print pamphlets and scientific papers that demonstrate how wrong they are, and distribute them to every household. This should keep more people from joining Fact Battlers, convince some of the Battlers to change what they believe, and let the survivors get their much-needed peace."

[4]. Walter Lee, your loyal driver, swings a fist at Mr. Mission, knocking him down. "Boss! We were there, you and me! We dug through rubble with our bare hands!

*1. "I can't do it anymore!" gasps pharmacist @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ breathlessly, currently squashed up against the elevator doors. "I know wearing clothing is illegal, but I just can't work like this anymore. I had a patient come in looking to get their eczema prescription compounded. Do you know what it was? Coal tar ointment.

3. Comforting @@LASTNAME_1@@ is world-renowned cardiologist @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@ "Look at @@HIM_1@@! Surely you can see the effect that this ban on clothing has on us?

"While reversing the ban on clothing might have Dr. @@LASTNAME_2@@ looking Dr. Fashionista, the problem isn't as bad as @@HE_2@@ makes it out to be", says Nurse @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAMEFEMALE@@ Ratchet, squeezing herself through the crowd to speak to you.

The Issue
Dye effluent from a textile factory has turned the waters of a neighboring river a vivid red, angering nearby residents. The incident has placed the practices of the dye industry and the use of synthetic dyes squarely in the limelight.

The Debate
1. "We can't let this stain our nation any further lest we die!" growls local resident @@RANDOM_NAME@@, using colorful language to emphasize @@HIS@@ point. "Toxic and carcinogenic chemicals are being dumped into our water supply. Ban synthetic dyes and follow the example of us townsfolk: use only natural dyes, as most of them are non-toxic and safer to produce and handle than artificial colorants. All we need is plenty of cleared, arable land for dye production. That, and over three million snails — something to keep the kids occupied, you know."

2. "Sure, natural dyes might sound great, but you're taking this a shade too far," cautions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a dye industry spokesperson. "Think of the environment! We would have to decimate our woodlands and wildlife to fit in dye plantations. Even then, our economy and our clothes would be feeling blue if disaster struck the dye crop. However, I do empathize with those affected by whatever happened. A little 'financial incentive' will help us research and develop safer synthetic dyes."

3. "Lavender lagoons? Scarlet streams? Count me in!" chimes tourism and novelty museum tycoon @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Finding chemicals in the water is anything but a problem; in fact, it's a prime opportunity! We should add a bit of color to our lackluster lakes; the oddly-pigmented oddities would become tourist magnets!

Let's dye ourselves into the next golden age!"

[b][anchor=1048]#1048[/anchor]: Tatty Treaty Spat Turns Catty [Yahlia; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
University scholars recently made headlines for their discovery that an antiquated treaty between the government and the native Violetstone tribe was never correctly translated into the tribe's language. The treaty - in which the tribe agreed to give up a substantial portion of their native lands - used verb tenses which implied that the agreement was only temporary. Speakers have converged in your office from each of the four directions to give their opinion on the matter.

The Debate
1. Chief Sitting @@ANIMAL@@, elected representative of the Violetstone tribe, paces in front of your desk indignantly. "All my ancestors have been cheated of our sacred land by your people. How are we supposed to thrive on tiny parcels of arid land like Spruce Ridge and Leaning Rock Reservations? I demand that all that was once ours is immediately returned to us, regardless of whether the land is privately or publicly owned. It is our heritage and birthright!"

2. "This simply cannot happen!" proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Housing and Development, after Chief Sitting @@ANIMAL@@ has returned to the sweat lodge that he constructed on your front lawn. "These people are laying claim to productive commercial and industrial zones, along with residential land that was settled by thousands of families. We cannot afford to give up these areas. So what if a few minorities get upset? We need to keep this land, for the prosperity of @@NAME@@!"

3. Your exasperated secretary hurries over to deliver a new folder of issues to you. "Obviously, we can't just return the land; it's too valuable to the country. But we can't ignore these people either; they're too large a percentage of our population to be disregarded." Looking pensive, @@HE@@ pauses for a moment and readjusts @@HIS@@ glasses. "How about we reimburse them another way? A lump sum of a few million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ should settle them down, right?"

4. "Listen to this codswallop!" grumbles your bigoted great-uncle while jotting down a series of misspelled racist slogans in a tattered notebook. "These leeches have contributed nothing worth having to our glorious @@TYPE@@! They're lazy vagrants who create a burden on civilized society. All they do is take drugs and commit crimes.

The Issue
Drew Peacock, your Minister for Party Solidarity, has been looking a bit listless lately. It turns out that his doctor has told him that the National Health Service refuses to fund his needed erectile dysfunction medications.

The Debate
1. "This is no laughing matter," moans Minister Peacock. "These days I can barely raise even a smile when I'm with my girl, and it's making our relationship difficult. Sexual health is part of overall wellbeing, and I feel that the NHS should be funding the necessary medications, as well as maybe offering sex counselors and libido clinics. I wouldn't even mind if there was some sort of specialist on hand to show us where we're going wrong."

2. "Look, the NHS is having a hard time as it is," complains general practitioner Dr. Roger Knott stiffly. "We're not here to give leisure drugs for old men's indoor sports. The health service should be focusing on dealing only with diseases and conditions that threaten life and limb. And [i]that[/i] doesn't count as a limb, no matter how proud the good Minister is of it. Okay, here's the deal: let them have four pills per month each. That's a reasonable level of healthcare balanced against a cost-effective prescribing."

[3]. "You got to look at the root problem here, and I'm not talking about the Minister's little thing here," observes visiting United Federation ambassador Ima Meanie. "I'm talking about your socialist medicine. Allow the free market to penetrate the stiff front erected by the communist healthcare entities! It'll be hard on our wallets, but we won't beat it by being soft! By removing medicine from the hands of the government elite, competition will drive down the prices of treatment and drugs, and as a nation I reckon you'll spend a smaller percentage of the national GDP on medical care. That's exactly what things are like in the good ole United Federation, right?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "Maybe you don't need to be in such a hurry to see this as a problem," interjects the minister's wife Ivana Newlove, who has always kept her maiden name. "If the little fella doesn't feel like getting up in the morning, then let him sleep! Drew is almost fifty, for goodness sake; it's only natural that his love life is over.

The Issue
A judge from @@CAPITAL@@ recently promised significantly reduced jail time for criminals who volunteer to undergo surgical sterilization. Ten inmates have already agreed to go through with the procedure, and opponents are urging you to step in before more decide to go under the knife.

The Debate
1. "I don't see a cause for concern here," declares the infamous Judge @@RANDOM_NAME@@, notorious for being tough on crime. "It is a fact that the children of criminals are very likely to become criminals themselves. I want to end the cycle of children being born in these despicable, horrible, and awful places. I want to put an end to the violence, theft, rape, and gangsta music in my community. Besides, it's not as if I'm forcing them to do this; criminals make their own choices. And this is a choice that will benefit both the individual and society."

2. "This almost certainly does force prisoners to undergo a procedure," retorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former inmate turned masseuse. "The incarcerated will do everything they can to get out in the least amount of time, even if that means agreeing to a procedure they would never do otherwise. Do I have to explain why it's wrong for the government to sterilize people? The judge probably isn't even allowed to do this sort of thing, and if she is, it definitely should be illegal. What we need to do is give the incarcerated more choices in what they can do in prison, like maybe a good massage every once in a while."

3. "The judge has somethin' right!" grunts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a warden at the @@CAPITAL@@ Correctional Facility who speaks loudly to compensate for carrying a small stick. "We give too dang much freedom to them prisoners. What we need tuh do is take the whole choosing part out and sterilize all of 'em. Once they commit a crime, they lose all them privileges, like the ability to get pregnant or say no."

The Maxtopian ambassador @@RANDOM_NAME@@ was recently shipwrecked on @@HIS@@ way to meet with you. Thankfully, your coast guard rescued @@HIM@@ and brought @@HIM@@ safely to your office. @@HE@@ is still angry, however, since @@HE@@ would have preferred to fly into your country if your aircraft ban hadn't stopped @@HIM@@ from doing so.

The Debate
1. "This is wholly unacceptable!" gargles @@HIS@@ Excellency as @@HE@@ wrings out @@HIS@@ still-wet hair, dropping a little anchovy on your carpet. "Do you know how long it takes to get from Maxtopia to @@NAME@@ by boat? Five days! Forgive me, @@LEADER@@, but I don't think it's fair that you have a universal ban on aircraft. Might I propose that diplomatic and governmental aircraft be exempt from the ban?

2. "I'm inclined to agree with you, Your Excellency," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your secretary who used to be an Air @@NAME@@ pilot, with a husky voice. "But I don't think it goes far enough. I think we should unleash the freedom of the skies, unchain the passion of flying, and let all airplanes take us - and our ground-bound economy - to the clouds above!"

3. "Go fly a k-kite!" exclaims stuttering aviophobe @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ emerges from the lunch cart @@HE@@ snuck in on. "Our c-current system is j-just fine.

Your secretary wakes you with a phone call at three o'clock in the morning. "Sorry to wake you, @@LEADER@@, but we have a problem. The severe rainy season has overwhelmed flood defences in an isolated northern part of @@NATION@@. Our engineers say we have half an hour before a storm surge sweeps through the region. Almost everyone in the area has been evacuated, with the exception of the inmates and guards at the notorious Zetatraz prison. I've got two officers on the line. Shall I put them through?"

The Debate
1. "We don't have the manpower to evacuate the prison in an orderly fashion!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@ over the sound of pouring rain. "You have to let us open the gates and give the prisoners a chance to get to high ground. Sure, some of these prisoners may be guilty of some serious offenses, but they're still human beings and you cannot leave them to drown! Give the order; I'm sure we'll be able to round them all up once the storm has passed."

2. "Tell me you're joking!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as you hear the heavy clang of keys being turned in old locks. "Zetatraz holds the worst of the worst.

The Issue
Amid the seemingly perpetual war raging in South Palisade, it appeared that your military personnel were making the most of the situation, and forming close — often physical — relationships with local women. Some even maintained a family off-base. With peace talks in the making, many people are debating the fate of these war brides and children.

The Debate
1. "We must get them back to @@NAME@@," insists Private @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Hammerstein, standing beside his long-time South Palisadian girlfriend as she cradles their infant son. "Have you seen what's happened here? The entire country's been destroyed, and who knows how long this peace agreement will last with those North Palisadians? I don't want my family left behind when the bombs start falling again. It behoves our nation to create an exemption to the immigration ban, to allow our beloved partners and children into @@NAME@@. Do we not have a duty to care for the families of the people who sacrifice everything for its safety?"

2. "Do we not have a duty?" singsongs Major @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Billis, who is rumoured to have fathered twenty-six illegitimate children in twenty-five countries. "I would say that clearly, we do not have a duty. There's nothing like a dame, but if these harlots from other lands are stupid enough to believe that it's love — let alone that love lasts longer than two minutes — that tells me all I need to know about their morals... It also tells me that we cannot allow such people into our country. Of course, our soldiers are upstanding persons of valour and, therefore, should give a financial remittance for any children begotten before they depart."

[3]. "Both these persons are disgusting," sighs Mary @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, Director of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Relationship Relational Service. "A relationship is built on long-term commitment and togetherness. Not picking a girl up because you're sorry for her, and not what that pig was doing either!

Experts say that this is because many women are terminating their unwanted pregnancies by using medicinal herbs like tansy or pennyroyal, which have abortifacient properties and are commonly grown as decorative plants in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ gardens.

The Debate
1. "This is a disgrace!" grunts vocal pro-life advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@, flourishing a bunch of pennyroyal flowers in your face. "These murderous witches always find a back door to kill the poor babies that had the misfortune to be begotten on them! @@LEADER@@, we must ban the sale of the seeds of these accursed plants and immediately form a special police division to eradicate and burn them wherever they grow, salting the earth so they can never sprout again."

2. "Look at my flowers!" interjects Ophelia @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, an eccentric professor of horticulture from @@CAPITAL@@ University, dancing into your room with a basket of flowers. "There's rosemary; that's for remembering. Please remember, love. And there are tansies; they're for removing impurities. There's a daisy - for decorating gardens. How dare you kill flowers? Punish the women who illegally use them to induce abortions, but please let all flowers grow freely." She then puts an amorphophallus titanum on your desk, and leaves the room singing.

3. "I hope you realize that it is not safe to abort a child by using these plants," mutters Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a gynecologist from @@ANIMAL@@ Valley Hospital. "Let's admit it: people will always find ways to circumvent laws that restrict their freedoms.

"There's only one thing to do with this conniving cetacean: send it to the nearest Dàguó restaurant and let's all treat ourselves to some sushi tonight!"

2. "Sushi is fish, and not even from Dàguó, you ignoramus!" points out your pedantic secretary, ironically confusing sushi and sashimi. "Look, there's so many of these animal oracles about that at least one of them was bound to have lucked into the right answers; that doesn't give them any future predictive value. We should just be treating this as harmless fun. Maybe you could run a competition to see which @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ pet has the strongest 'psychic abilities' and award a prize for that."

The Issue
A new administrative building for the Environmental Department is under fire from watchdog groups. An investigation found — among other things — that valuable wetland was drained for the foundation, unsustainable materials were used during construction, and energy-inefficient methods were chosen for the mechanical systems.

The Debate
1. "The government needs to do better," tuts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an activist protesting outside the department building. "All government agencies must be required to undergo an environmental impact assessment before any proposed action — building or otherwise. Not only do agencies need to report critical habitat affected as well as embodied energy costs for materials, et cetera; they must be required to follow the most environmentally friendly option possible. If even one thing is found out of place, a project shouldn't be allowed to go through. The conservation benefits are certainly worth it in the end."

2. "There's no way that our government could afford the highest level of environmental certifications on every government building!" excitedly cautions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Treasury Minister. "However, I do realize the need for our nation to be environmentally responsible. Go through with mandating a permitting process, but only for non-government construction! Let us take over the process of awarding green certification so that we can charge fees for everyone. This will be great for our nation's treasury and our environment!"

3. "There's no reason to go through with this," urges your Minister of Housing whilst urinating on a potted plant. "In fact, I say we teach these radical hippies a lesson. I have a list of the fragile habitats surrounding @@CAPITAL@@, home to some useless endangered snail species that no one cares about except these annoying tree huggers. I've also got three orders filed for United Federation granite — I hear they recently opened up one of their national parks for mining. Just say the word, and these ecofascists will be living their worst nightmare. Maybe then they'll get the message."

Despite spending copious amounts of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to turn the nation into a Calvinball powerhouse, @@NAME@@ finished in last place at the very next tournament. Some are now beginning to wonder if this money was well-spent.

The Debate
1. "Clearly we haven't spent enough!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Calvinball expert who reportedly has the world's only complete set of time-fracture wickets. "What we need to do is build the newest, state-of-the-art academies in every city. Even successful Calvinball countries like Ausblic will be in awe of them! If we build world-class facilities with pitches for every season, fitness and rehab centres, and the finest Skandilundian-designed saunas, we will finally achieve our dream of Calvinball superiority! Double the funding!"

2. "So what have we spent this money on?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head coach of the highly successful Chagrin Marauders. "We relaid a few pitches, bought some new equipment and built a couple of training centres. Yet, our players did worse than last time! We need to make sure that any kid who displays any sporting aptitude doesn't slip through the net. Force all children into mandatory attendance at these training centres. Their educational needs are secondary to our quest for Calvinball glory!"

3. "Our current crop of so-called 'world-class' players has clearly failed, despite all the money we threw at them," opines @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who grimaces every time @@HE@@ hears the official Calvinball song. "Forget about this rabble and instead transfer the funding to the professional development of our youngsters. We can create new youth clubs and leagues, and let's just forget about all this 'let's turn @@NAME@@ into a Calvinball powerhouse' nonsense. Encouraging kids to exercise and maintain good health is far more important than pursuing a hopeless dream. If the kids turn out to be world champions years down the line, then that's just a bonus."

4. "Listen," states your younger brother, the glint in his eye indicating that he has just come up with another harebrained idea. "Everything we've tried hasn't worked so far, so why not enact a program to kidnap all the best players and coaches from around the world? Bring them back to @@NAME@@ and force them at gunpoint to train and develop our athletes. All our players will then be able to improve their game from the skills and techniques of our kidnapees. Calvinball glory will soon be ours!"

Thankfully, passing cargo ship [i]The Silver Skate[/i] happened to be packed to the gills with sandbags, and the captain of the ship graciously unloaded the cargo, plugging the dike and saving the day. Despite the happy resolution, concerns surrounding the dikes still remain.

The Debate
1. "I'm happy to have been able to lend a hand," chats Captain Hans Blinker, fixing the wobbly leg on your desk with a folded-up business card. "I was on my way to deliver my regular shipment of sand to Macronesia when I noticed that your dike was springing a leak. Now, I think that this incident shows that more thorough maintenance of your dikes is necessary. You should probably slow down expansion into low-lands and coastal areas, and focus more on securing your existing land."

2. "Perhaps we should rethink and halt land reclamation," insists your Environment Minister, phoning in from @@HIS@@ beachfront house. "Not only does it cause irreversible damage to local marine wildlife, killing off coral reefs and polluting the sea, but it's also incredibly expensive. We should be living in harmony with the environment we have, not forcing it into new shapes."

3. "What's more important, some stupid fishes or the survival of our nation?" rebukes Head of Strategic Thinking @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pointing angrily at a map of @@REGION@@. "We need to be expanding our coastlines more aggressively! Forget dikes, we need to be building whole islands and peninsulas to lay claim to so-called 'international waters' as quickly as we can!

Your somewhat gullible nephew has returned from a shopping trip laden with 'bargains', including a dozen suits which he says were '50%-off'. Upon whipping out the office magnifying glass it appears that the discount stickers have 'up to' written in tiny letters just above the numbers, and a quick check of the store catalogue shows most of the items had their prices raised just days before to accommodate the so-called discount. All in all, his shopping trip has cost him twice what he would have paid if he had been charged the manufacturers' recommended prices.

The Debate
1. "Look, we all know that my son is an idiot," says your sister irritably, smacking the kid around the head, "but anyone could be misled by these tricks and number games.

The Debate
1. "We are the laughing stock of @@REGION@@," opines your mother, as she picks up the litter on the floor of your office. "We need to draw up a list of government-sanctioned guidelines to show @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ how to behave properly in the countries they are visiting, and require that all travel agents hand over a copy to anyone who books a foreign holiday.

[b][anchor=1065]#1065[/anchor]: Pulling Out [Jutsa; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati] [/b]

The Issue
Several nations that are party to the international climate treaty have been falling short of the treaty's set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A few nations have even decided to withdraw from the agreement, leaving many worried about the future of the treaty and the planet.

The Debate
1. "Did they really just pull out and leave us?" histrionically shrieks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your country's biggest advocates for signing the climate agreement. "We must not be impotent; we need to compensate for the rest of the world's dangerous, lazy indifference.

4. "So, you want to help our planet by bombing other countries?" mockingly interrogates Catherine Gratwick, recent victor of the Annual @@CAPITAL@@ Dance-Off. "Forcing nations back into the agreement won't help; in fact, they may be on to something here.

The Debate
1. "Let's just hold our horses on all this 'merger' talk," murmurs Commerce Minister @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ 'Trust Buster' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ polishes an oversized walking stick. "If these two companies merge, the resulting behemoth would monopolize at least 75% of the industry. How would any of the smaller businesses be able to compete?

2. "These companies are making record profits off the green stuff!" notes your Finance Minister, who is wearing a Maxtopian Grass t-shirt. "It's high time that the government got involved. Rather than blocking the merger, why don't we just become the competition?

You know, when I was a young and dazzling girl, everything was made to last for a lifetime. You remember my sewing machine? It was a gift from my sister, and it still works like I bought it yesterday! You should make it so that all products have to have a lifetime warranty, darling. I'm sure manufacturers would do their best to produce durable stuff, then."

2. "No! Terrible idea!" sputters your uncle, one of the company directors of TurboLux Household Appliances, spewing out his tea onto his croissant. "If you extend the warranties, people will just break their stuff on purpose to get cutting-edge new devices. I think we would fare far better if you abolished warranty requirements altogether.

"My East-Lebatuck-made toaster has been working for three decades now!

After a hologram of the recently deceased musician Jack Michaelson stole the show at last night's @@NAME@@ Music Awards, the ethical question of using holographic technology to bring back the dead has dominated national news.

The Debate
1. "Think about how many @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ can be made!" enthuses concert promoter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, handing out Jack Michaelson memorabilia to your staff. "Jack Michaelson is still one of the most popular musicians in @@NAME@@ despite his unfortunate death. It's not just advances in holographic technology either - with AI algorithms able to copy his composition style, we could even see him producing new material. Not even death can stop us!"

2. "Nobody asked me for my opinion!" wails @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@, the pop star's widow, while holding on to her late husband's pet monkey. "If my Jack were still alive he would never have allowed this abomination to take his place. Do you shameless sell-outs have no respect for the dead? We must let the dead stay dead!"

3. "People also said computers and the internet were just fads," muses self-described mad scientist Bongani Plantagenet while analyzing your coffee with a microscope. "We could instead take things further: holographic dead actors releasing new films, holographic fashion models on a post-mortem catwalk, even holographic politicians of yesteryear giving stirring speeches and debating each other in government. Current politicians are already so empty-headed, err, present company excluded of course, that nobody will notice the difference. Imagine the possibilities! All I'll need is some generous funding to get this project out of mothballs."

The Issue
An unlikely alliance of risque comedians and baby boomers has barged into your office, annoyed about how easily young people get offended these days.

The Debate
*1. "What these immature juveniles need is good ol' discipline!" says retired army Major @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, known by his neighbors as 'The Major'. "Back in the day we didn't have the time to be offended by everything and anything; we were too busy fighting for the @@TYPE@@. Conscript these fruitcakes; the military will set them straight."

Stick these fruitcakes on the front line; proper soldiering will set them straight." [[color=red]Must have conscription[/color]]

3. "Why did the chicken cross the road?" asks famous comedian @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, as she reveals a punchline to your staff that elicits more shocks than laughs. "Look, I'm just trying to make a living here. Do you know how difficult it is when these kids are posting how insensitive my jokes are all over social media? Artists like myself should not have their careers destroyed just because some college students can't appreciate a good joke when they hear one. We should ban the internet and save ourselves from the comments section!"

4. "STOP MICRO-AGGRESSIONS!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@, not looking at you as she types intently on her cell phone. "Young people like myself understand how language is only a social construct to keep the oppressed subjugated, but the old ones don't. It is high time people like these two fossils stop benefiting from the misery of this nation's downtrodden. Sensitivity training should be mandatory for all people over 40."

5. "It doesn't have to be either way," says your Secretary of Solutions, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as he takes away the phone from the teen, puts duct tape over the mouth of the comedian, and formally discharges the Major. "What we need is a government-approved words and phrases list. That way kids won't be offended and comics can still make their jokes. It's a win-win! Well, except for freedom of speech, but that's not the issue here, is it?"

[b][anchor=1074]#1074[/anchor]: Halting the Heirloom Heist! [Candensia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
[i]Occam's Eleven[/i], a sensational and skillful group of international artifact thieves, have been making the headlines after a series of successful heists. Rumours and international police investigations suggest that their next target is the Crown Jewels of @@NAME@@!

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, it's time that you recognised that our national treasures should be under lock and key, protected by heavy security," insists @@CAPITAL@@ Chief of Police @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Dreyfus. "Precious artifacts like these royal heirlooms shouldn't be on public display where they are vulnerable, but should be placed in secure hidden locations. So rest assured, if you put the law in charge of this matter, we'll stop the heists and bust these ghosts."

2. "Regular cops aren't enough to catch thieves like these," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a high-level official with the Ministry of Expensive Solutions. "It's time to broadcast an SOS to the finest freelance detectives in the world, by offering a reward for the capture of the most notorious criminals. Maybe we'll attract Hermione Clouseau, who solved the Crimson Cougar Diamond mystery! Or maybe we'll get infamous bounty hunter Bobbi Feta on the case. Either way, we're going to need the very best to catch crooks like these!"

3. "Expensive things are always going to be targeted by thieves; what we need to do is remove the temptation," suggests your Minister for the Treasury. "Fabricate cheap petrochemical carbon-copies of the Crown Jewels for the royals to wear, and sell off the originals for the Treasury's benefit. No thief is going to bother stealing worthless replicas."

4. "You're right that we can't be stopped," interrupts Billy 'Razor' Occam, the master criminal's handsome face appearing on a widescreen wall monitor as he transmits to you from a beach in Manamana. "But honestly, we don't need the crown, so let's cut a deal. The, uh, extended family and I have always wanted to take an unsupervised tour of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Bullion Depository, Fort Rocks. I'll call off the heist if you let us take a look around."

[b][anchor=1075]#1075[/anchor]: The Hand That Feeds [Gnejs; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
The all but non-existent agricultural sector of @@NATION@@ has concerned your policy advisors for some time. The nation's great reliance on food imports is viewed as a major risk, due to the real possibility of your trading partners deciding to withhold much-needed imports as leverage to extract economic and political gains. The problem has been thrust to the top of your agenda after a high-profile public disagreement left a Bigtopian attaché making less than thinly veiled threats about cancelled shipments.

The Debate
1. "We can no longer depend on foreign nations for our food; it's too dangerous," warns one of your senior advisors. "We desperately need to aim for complete self-sufficiency. Let's revitalise our domestic food production and immediately allocate government land for farming purposes! We'll need a lot of labour. I suggest that the able-bodied adult population be randomly divided into several groups, with the duty of working on the farms rotating among the groups each year. Heavily fine those who don't comply. Folks won't be happy about it, but this is necessary for our survival. We currently grow none of the food we eat!"

2*. "Yeah, that sounds great and all, except for the part where you expect me to go farming," complains your secretary while undergoing an extensive pedicure program. "Why can't you let in some of those weird refugees that are just hanging around the border? They could do the farming for us! They already smell, and I'm sure they'll be glad of the work!" [[color=blue]Must allow Immigration[/color]]

[[color=red]Must not allow Immigration[/color]]

4. "I don't wanna use the word, but I'll just say that Bigtopia is taking advantage of us," rasps the thick industrialist Edward Rump. "When was the last time anybody saw us beating them in a trade deal? With Bigtopia, we are losing 500 bazillion @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ a year. We tax them practically nothing. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna charge a tariff on the food they bring in until such time as they straighten out their act and behave properly. Bigtopia is but one of our sources for food, and we'll just take our money elsewhere if they don't play fair. And it's all gonna work out; it's all gonna work out. Remember this, remember this — it's all gonna work out."

5. "We obviously can't leave ourselves to the mercy of our trading partners," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, yet another one of your trusted advisors. "But turning all of @@NATION@@ into a vegetable garden and forcing people to tend it sounds like something the Khmer Bleu of Marche Noire would do! Let's just provide some really generous incentives for potential farmers, all while maintaining our import quotas. We can tweak them every year. If we just keep this system up long enough, we'll strike a balance eventually. Some say you can't have it all, but we're going to make a cake and eat it too!"

[b][anchor=1076]#1076[/anchor]: Smokers Cornered [Lancaster of Wessex; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
Despite widespread public awareness about the dangers of smoking, the habit still continues among a sizeable portion of the population. Shady looking teenagers, stressed-out office workers, and chatterbox seniors can still be seen puffing away.

The Debate
1. "There's no better way to end this filthy habit once and for all than by hitting smokers where it hurts: no, not their lungs, but their wallets!" reflects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Health and Ruining Fun, whilst crunching on a celery stick. "Making ciggies punitively expensive with enforced minimum pricing will make most smokers think twice before they buy their next pack and will have them abandoning this habit before you can say 'cough'!" 

2. "Um, if I may be so bold as to make a suggestion @@LEADER@@," enquires @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your office cleaner, as @@HE@@ briefly stops polishing your photo frame. "Cigarettes are one of the few pleasures the poorer members of society have. I beg you to find it within your heart to make smokes as inexpensive as possible."

3. "By Jove, old sport, I have a smashing plan," wheezes rotund blue-blood Charles Uppington-Noseworthy. "The government should prohibit cigarettes, while permitting only the more dignified forms of tobacco: cigars, pipes, and snuff - but please - avoid the hideous levies on them. Just think about it: chaps would finally be gentlemen again, and the air would be rich with scents of spice, cedar and carcinogens! As for the ladies - well, they should not partake in smoking; 'tis not becoming of the fairer sex."

4. "This has to be the most disgusting habit ever," opines ex-smoker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a heavily chewed pencil at you. "Cancer, lung disease, heart disease, financial costs. There is nothing good about smoking, nothing. I'm totally glad I quit and I so don't follow smokers around to inhale their second-hand fumes. You need to ban all forms of tobacco now! Get that temptation away from me... I mean, for everyone's health!"

[b][anchor=1077]#1077[/anchor]: With Friends Like These... [Sacara; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A TV network recently aired a rerun of [i]Enemies[/i], a popular television series from twenty-five years ago. However, the humor has dated badly, and many of the jokes are now being seen as transphobic, homophobic, bigoted, and racist.

The Debate
1. "My eyes!" screeches your niece, obviously distressed and trembling with shock. "How did anyone ever find this funny? It's just sick, absolutely sick. Like that one episode when they pejoratively used the appellation 'gay' to describe someone who was being emotionally vulnerable? Disgusting! You've got to ban re-runs of bigoted shows like this once and for all, so no one else will have to endure these offensive horrors!"

2. "Hey, what's the dealo?" questions Ross @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, one of the stars of the show in question. "This is classic comedy, man. I mean, you couldn't get away with saying half the stuff that we did, but you'd be destroying a national masterpiece. We need to keep this to teach people what @@NAME@@ used to be like. Keep the history, man, don't ever be censoring entertainment!"

3. "Heh, have I got a solution for you," mutters your bored-looking Minister of Propaganda, twiddling @@HIS@@ thumbs absent-mindedly. "My ministry will take control of producing content that will both be inoffensive and pro-government. While we're at it, give us control of news media too. We will control the horizontal. We will control the vertical."

4. "For Violet's sake, the average @@DEMONYM@@ has gotten far too soft," comments one of your brothers, looking at your niece with disgust. "We need to educate them to have thicker skin and take a joke or two, no matter how crude. How about we add a class or two in our education system that'll teach 'em how to handle some humor?"

[b][anchor=1078]#1078[/anchor]: Down With That? [Sacara; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
A @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ cruise ship ran aground last week in the treacherous waters off the southern coast. The captain, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, had infamy bestowed upon @@HIM_1@@ after it was found that @@HE_1@@ abandoned ship before all of the passengers on board safely made it off, defying centuries of maritime tradition.

The Debate
1. "Twenty people drowned in that accident, and that scum-bag decided @@HIS_1@@ life was more important?" rhetorically asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the surviving passengers of the ship, still visibly shaken by what had occurred. "Ship captains should always see to it that everyone on board gets off safely before they do – after all, they can't direct the rescue effort if they aren't on the actual ship! If they don't, we must punish these cowards to the fullest extent of the law!"

2. "Let's not be too hasty about assigning blame here!" counters Captain @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, who's remarkably shorter and skinnier than you expected @@HIM_1@@ to be. "I'm just as traumatized as anyone else. I was actually helping coordinate the rescue operation, albeit from the safety of land. It's not my duty to add to the death toll, is it?"

3. "That captain is nothing but a lily-livered land-lubber!" scoffs Rear Admiral @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "When @@NAME@@ first took to the seas, the ship's captain was obliged to go down with the ship, even if they were within spitting distance of the shore! It was the honourable thing to do back then. We should return to our maritime traditions and any captain that doesn't like it should be given a good ol' keel-hauling!"

[b][anchor=1079]#1079[/anchor]: What's Love Got to Do With It? [The Free Joy State; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
When you walk into your office, you see Bart, your personal secretary, in a passionate — and completely illegal — clinch with @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@, your other brother.

The Debate
1. "Yes, Bart and I are in love," sighs @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_1@@, as your personal secretary straightens his tie and smooths his hair. "We've been meeting in secret for three years now. It's been difficult, and I've hated hiding it from you. I so wanted to tell my favourite sibling that I met a wonderful human being: intelligent, articulate, caring... but because of the law, I didn't dare. Isn't it time to change that law? Do you know how it feels, to be unable to walk down the street with your sweetheart or even buy a Violetine's Day card without being harassed? Wouldn't it be just fabulous if we could have the same rights as heterosexual couples?"

2. "Of course they kept it a secret," barks your traditionalist Minister of the Interior, as he slams his riding crop repeatedly against his own thigh with unusual pink-cheeked glee. "Because they're nothing but a pair of sodomites. 'Love'? Pah! They are no more capable of such wholesome emotion than a pair of orang-utans. And what do we do when we want an animal to cease rutting? We neuter them. All sexual inverts, regardless of gender or social position, must be taken to a medical centre and doctored, so they are incapable of feeling lascivious lusts." With a long sigh, he finally brings the crop to rest.

*3. "That seems awfully... draconian," muses @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your Minister of Public Schools, whose fifteen year marriage is childless. "I was just saying to my wife Alex — she's busy at the forge today: who doesn't go through a phase in their younger years? It's expected for a young man or woman to have a very close chum, with whom they tousle, and cuddle and even snog a bit. So I hear. @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@ will grow out of it. There's no call for any, shall we say, unpleasantness. Just encourage weddings with a pro-marriage campaign, a matchmaking service specifically for those with close same-sex friends seeking simpatico spouses, and a monetary gift to newly-wed couples. He'll soon find a nice gal, and forget all about @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@... erm, Bart." [[color=blue]Marriage is legal[/color]]

[b][anchor=1080]#1080[/anchor]: The End Was Nigh [Jutsa; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
48 hours ago, Lieutenant Colonel @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Air Defence Force received a nuclear missile detection alert advising @@HIM@@ that an ICBM from the hostile nation of Blackacre was inbound for @@CAPITAL@@. According to military protocol, @@HE@@ should have reported this immediately, which would have led to a nuclear counter-strike. However, @@HE@@ suspected a false alarm, and did not alert anyone of @@HIS@@ findings until later. Subsequent investigations showed that the system had actually detected a red balloon.

The Debate
1. "@@FIRSTNAME_1@@ saved the world from apocalypse!" sings Mrs. @@LASTNAME_1@@, @@HIS_1@@ doting mother. "Had @@HE_1@@ reported this, we would all now be radioactive ash! @@HE_1@@ should be lauded as a hero, and a saviour of the world's future! Speaking of the future, you should really put more tax money into malfunction detection training and overhauling the equipment. If my little angel isn't on duty and something like this happens again, who knows what might happen?"

2. "Sure, let's reward @@HIM_1@@ for not doing @@HIS_1@@ job," sneers your Minister of Propaganda. "We'd become an international laughingstock. Instead, we must pretend this never happened, and @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ must be demoted and appropriately disciplined for breaking protocol." @@HE_2@@ leans forward to whisper in your ear. "We'll probably need to do something about @@HIS_1@@ mother, too."

3. "The fact that we're always on the verge of nuclear apocalypse is a real problem here," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pacifist author of nonfiction paperback [i]Nukes: What Are They Good For?[/i]. "We must get rid of all of our weapons of mass destruction, so we can avoid, you know, destroying the world."

4. "Hey, what idiot put a red balloon up there?" asks globophobe Willy Denbrough, who had a bad experience with a clown back in 1986. "They're a waste of helium and are just useless nasty things. If we ban balloons, we'll be sure this problem won't arise again!"

The Issue
An undergraduate medical statistician has stumbled across a weird occurrence: three of the five actors involved in a theatrical piece called [i]The Queen in Yellow[/i], as well as over ten percent of the members of the opening night audience, have since received diagnoses of various psychiatric illnesses. The media have picked up on this, labelling it "the play that sends you mad", and predictably ticket sales are now skyrocketing.

The Debate
1. "I, uh..." stutters Cassilda, a former actress in the play, dismissed for 'creative differences'. "I, uh, cth... think you fh... should stop the sh... show. My dreams haven't been right since I was in the pl... play. The strange m-moon, the sh-shadows lengthen..."

2. "Selective reporting!" shouts mathematics professor Camilla Whateley. "It's like when they claimed that fighter jet pilots were having more female children, all over again. You need to learn how selection bias and basic statistics work. More to the point, the nation needs to learn how these things work. I'd suggest making stats a compulsory part of a properly funded core school curriculum. 85.7% of the seven statisticians I surveyed agree this is a good idea. The other guy, he's just an annoying smelly little..."

3. "But..." interjects an excitable stranger with a queer narrow head, a flat nose and bulgy, starry eyes. "But this is the most important theatrical production since Shoggoth on the Roof! Please accept these free tickets from us devoted fans, then personally endorse this wonderful play."

[b][anchor=1082]#1082[/anchor]: It's Hard to Separate the Truth From Entertainment [USS Monitor; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
After an election season featuring bake-offs, dance-offs, rap battles, wet T-shirt contests, and occasional sumo matches between candidates for public office, some people think politicians are spending too much time on publicity stunts and not enough time on serious debate.

The Debate
1. "They aren't just publicity stunts," claims Tulsi Haggard, a surfer and country music star who serves as a member of Congress in her spare time. "These events are an important way for candidates to show that they're in touch with regular people. In fact, we should encourage candidates to express their individuality on the campaign trail. Now would you like to hear my latest song about sales tax exemptions?"

2. "When people run for office, they should be talking about the issues, not their music career," says politician Lisbeth Burrows as she looks around your office and sketches a plan for redecorating it. "You don't see me running campaign ads about how many computers I hacked for fun or how many tattoos I have. We need more responsible election coverage and better oversight of the process before we end up with Edward Rump or Catherine Gratwick leading our country."

3. "Even if Tulsi Haggard stops parading around half-naked, Lisbeth Burrows stops talking about her fry bread recipe, and Ernie Flanders stops conducting symphonies, that won't stop voters from getting duped," sulks your Foreign Secretary, Hillary Smoochinger. "As long as elections are a popularity contest, personality politics are going to get in the way of choosing the most qualified candidates. We should just conduct surveys to find out what policies our citizens want, and you could appoint the most qualified experts to implement them. It's still democracy, except that people are recommending policies instead of voting for candidates."

4. "What do we need surveys for?" asks yogurt manufacturer and inflammatory political activist Steve Dannon. "If people aren't smart enough to see through these campaign gimmicks, they aren't smart enough to know what policies are best for the country. The fact that [i]these[/i] people are allowed in positions of power and I'm making yogurt should be all the evidence you need that democracy doesn't work. Why don't you just get rid of it? I'd be happy to give you some advice on how to run things."

The Issue
After a ring of black market fences were caught dealing in stolen goods from @@CAPITAL@@ to the rural village Noh Weir, pawn shops have fallen under scrutiny for their role in reselling illicitly-acquired wares.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, I've had it up to here with these pawn shops. They've taken it a step too far!" The flustered @@RANDOM_NAME@@ shakes @@HIS@@ fist. "They bought my TV from a criminal! Then sold it back to me! Sure, it took me a week to even notice, and only because of the smell, but that doesn't matter! They are accomplices to this crime, and I demand justice. No, I demand vengeance! No more second-hand stores!"

2. "We don't need such a drastic decision," pipes up Minister of Justice @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We just need to regulate these stores. Before any product can be sold, run these items through some police databases, and take extensive notes on the seller to crosscheck for criminal history. Sure, it will cost the taxpayers a bit, but they'll make it back with the great deals on used stereo systems."

3. Pawnbroker @@RANDOM_NAME@@ removes @@HIS@@ sunglasses. "I've been in this business my whole life, like my father before me. But now a few bad apples are giving us a bad name. If you help subsidize a television show about our hard-working salespeople, maybe we can change the public's mind. I'm sure we can meet halfway."

4. @@RANDOM_NAME@@ finally steps forward from the shadows, inviting you to kiss @@HIS@@ ringed hand. "Look, @@LEADER@@, let me be clear. This is a perfectly legitimate business. We can provide paperwork on our taxes and all. But I'd rather just give you a gift of a widescreen plasma TV. Just be careful, you might blind yourself on this picture quality. If you do, perhaps... turn that blinded eye toward our business."

The Issue
Following an incident in which a newly appointed diplomat from a small neighbouring nation attempted to greet the monarch of @@NAME@@ with a high-five, people are questioning just how much deference should be shown to royalty.

The Debate
1. "People have forgotten how to treat their social betters," says arch-conservative courtier @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose manservant holds a pack of ravenous hounds on a leash. "Giving proper deference to our reigning sovereign is the duty of every patriotic and right-minded subject. A bow or curtsy is not enough. Citizens and visitors must demonstrate true respect by prostrating themselves on their hands and knees before the monarch in a deep kowtow. Maybe then they'll learn their place."

2. "I don't think we need to go quite that far," interjects Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, squirming away from the hounds who are showing particular interest in @@HIM@@. "I am all for giving respect to the monarch and their family, but there is no need to kowtow. With a simple bow or curtsy, people can show respect and maintain their dignity."

3. "Kowtowing? Bowing and curtsying? What century are you all in?" exclaims Prince @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, heir of the nation that caused the incident, who was recently featured in [i]Monarchy Magazine[/i]'s '40 Cool Courtiers Under 40' issue. "Why doesn't the monarchy show how with-it and relatable it is by abolishing all protocol? It'll make the sovereign of @@NAME@@ closer to the people!"

4. "Or, we could just get rid of the monarchy," suggests unconventional socialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, author of famously short manifesto [i]Simple Solutions for Troubled Times[/i]. "Then we wouldn't need to worry about how much respect to show the monarch, because there won't be one. Simple."

[b][anchor=1085]#1085[/anchor]: Nuke Before You Leap [Nation of Quebec; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
Traditionally, the leader of @@NAME@@ is the only person in the country who can authorize the use of nuclear weapons. However, the increasingly threatening rhetoric between @@NAME@@ and Blackacre, another nuclear weapons state, is making the top brass of the military concerned that the lack of checks and balances could easily trigger a nuclear war.

The Debate
1. "There needs to be more than just your authorization to launch an attack with our WMDs," asserts General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the senior commander of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ military. "It's not that we don't trust you. It's just that this Blackacre situation is giving us lots of sleepless nights. All it would take is for one insult or threat to be taken too seriously and we'd be hurled into a devastating war we may not recover from. Launches of WMDs should require the approval of the military brass plus some additional checks and confirmation codes, not just your assent. Nothing wrong with being a little cautious, is there?"

2. "Getting everyone's consent takes time, and time is a luxury we can't afford in a volatile situation," states your security adviser while drawing devil horns on a picture of Blackacre's leader. "Do you think the dictator of Blackacre is going to waste time with consultants when she decides to launch her nukes? We need to act fast in these kinds of situations. You, @@LEADER@@, need to have the ability to unilaterally declare nuclear war and launch our most powerful weapons without anyone getting in the way. Just push the big red button and Blackacre goes poof!"

3. "Or better yet, you can start dismantling those weapons!" demands your wayward niece, wearing a t-shirt with the words 'No More Torpedoes' emblazoned across the chest. "These bombs are capable of destroying Zeesh ten times over! @@NAME@@ must make a stand and take the first step towards peace. Ban weapons of mass destruction, and other brave nations will surely follow suit. I don't want my future children to inherit a post-apocalyptic @@NAME@@!"

4. "The problem here is the figurative big red button itself," muses Dr. Honey Bell-Lecter from the Institute of Thought Experimentation. "Launching nuclear weapons is an action that would definitely kill millions and could kill everyone in the world. Simply ordering a nuclear attack doesn't have enough moral cognitive weight to it. Thus, the launch codes should be stitched in the viscera of one of your loved ones. That way, you can still trigger global Armageddon if you deem it necessary, but having to first kill and disembowel your loved one makes the suffering sufficiently real for you and forces you to confront the ethical consequences of your actions."

Worried by the likely fall in foreign arrivals, your Tourism Minister has suggested an area of @@NAME@@ be marked for development. However, what area should be selected and what type of activities should be promoted?

The Debate
1. Oi guv'nor, what them tourists want is to feast their peepers on real life, with real people," suggests 'Acksaw 'Arry, a colourful gent, who has an equally colourful association with the law. "Spend a few bob building up the working-class areas of @@CAPITAL@@.

One of your aides, who is from that area of @@CAPTIAL@@, translates: "He said that the tourists should experience traditional home hospitality, with beverages and a sing-a-long."

2. "One proposes that you send those tourists to one's stately home," opines Rubert Holdsworth-Wellington, an eminent member of @@CAPITAL@@'s old money. "There's acres of room, literally. There will be fine dining available throughout their stay and for entertainment they may savour some outdoor pursuits. For example: one's two-acre maze, horse-riding and of course, learning the skill of hedge artistry. Just pay one a stipend for allowing those riff-raff into one's home."

[3]. "G'day mate! Send 'em tourists down to the beach," declares Sheila Billabong, as she hands her surfboard to your Tourism Minister. "We'll show them how a true-blue @@DEMONYM@@ lives life in the sun. We just need you gumument fellas to put shark nets all over the place; then those tourists will be riding waves in no time!" [[color=purple]Must not have a trash environment[/color]]

[4]. "Y'all shouldn't listen to those guys; they're all hat and no cattle!" states Chuck Butch III, whose riding spurs barely fit through your door. "Send those tourists to my ranch; there ain't nothin' bigger or better. We'll show them how to herd cattle, use a lasso, and treat them to the biggest darn steak they've ever seen! With a bit of extra moolah from the gov'ment, I'll set up a rodeo. Yee-haa!" [[color=blue]Must not be vegetarian[/color]]

5. "Yodel-lay-ee-dee," exclaims Frau Helga Krapps, who is trying to set a new fashion statement with her pinny. "Ze tourists vould be much better coming to my ski resort in der Alpen region of @@NAME@@. They can stay in mein beautiful chalets overlooking ze pistes. Ve have skiing, snowboarding und sledging for ze little munchkins. I just vant ze government to let us put artificial snow on the slopes for drier seasons. Danke!"

6. "Hey man, we should, like, promote sustainable ecotourism," insists Dylan, a tatty looking fellow who you swear just had a small creature rummaging around in his beard. "Our countryside is pretty cool, @@LEADER@@. The government should make laws to protect our forests and rivers, then those tourist dudes will come in swarms to marvel at Mother Nature's creations man!"

7. "Get off my property!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is rumoured to be the grumpiest @@MAN@@ in all of @@NAME@@. "I don't want no tourists coming over here and having fun, especially near me. Hey, you tourists! No fun, do you hear? Folks used to be able to have fun 'round here, then some tourists came along and started having some fun - ruined it for everyone. Tell them tourists they're not welcome here!"

[b][anchor=1087]#1087[/anchor]: An International Dictatorial Dilemma [Chan Island; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The Despojanbourg Republic is a tiny but strategically located mountainous country that has long been in your nation's repertoire of allies, despite its reputation for below-average human rights. The authoritarian, fiercely pro-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ government is a linchpin of regional security. However, a recent series of enormous protests calling for "real democracy" and "new leadership" has shaken its stability to the core.

The Debate
1. "You can't let our friends go down if you can help it," explains strategic analyst @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who almost looks like a different person every time you see him. "Despojanbourg has helped us eliminate countless terrorist cells and apprehend many other criminals. They have scratched our backs so much, it's time we scratched theirs. I recommend sending a military expeditionary force to crack down on the protests and help them root out dissidents. It'll probably look bad in the press, but we have to stay safe."

2. "You're right, it will look awful in the press," notes your rarely seen Minister of Whispers after entering the room through a concealed passage under the floorboards. "That's why we need to be much more subtle about this. Instead of soldiers, send in operatives to assist their secret police, diplomats who will promise to negotiate changes - without actually doing anything, and 'election observers' to come up with even more creative ways of rigging their upcoming sham elections. Nobody will ever know a thing."

3. "Why are we propping up a failing dictator?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your more idealistic and hot-headed advisors. "Just because they were nice to us one or a hundred times? No, declare your support for the coming revolution. Call for real, free, and fair elections! These people deserve a government that isn't hopelessly corrupt. I'm sure the members of their current administration will receive a fair trial... as long as they're not beaten to death by angry mobs first."

[4]. "You're partially correct," notes Major General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who reportedly uses a level to ensure that @@HIS@@ haircut is perfectly flat. "The people of Despojanbourg absolutely have a right to democracy, but our people also have a right to stay safe. Therefore, the solution is obvious: let them have their new government, but inform the new administration that we'll end all military and economic assistance unless they allow us to convert some of their land into @@DEMONYM@@ military bases. Sure, they might complain about 'sovereignty', but sovereignty doesn't stop Maxtopian-inspired terrorists. We do." [[color=purple]Must supply foreign aid[/color]]

The Issue
Scandalously, a recent TV interview revealed that your Minister for Public Health doesn't know much about being healthy. @@HE_1@@ didn't know the difference between a bacterium and a virus, and thought that Ebola was the name of a Bigtopian princess.

The Debate
1. Director of Communications Malcolm Capaldi has had a very busy day shouting at his inferiors, but makes some time to shout at you. "Right, that is it! I've had enough of politicians with no experience or knowledge of their department's aegis. It's about as useful as asking a brain surgeon to climb a tree! What's next? An Environmental Advisor who doesn't believe in climate change? I say we need properly qualified professionals leading their departments. A doctor caring for the health service, a teacher in charge of education, and so on. In fact, there should be a mandatory examination paper that you have to pass to hold a government position. No more idiot politicians, please!"

2. Much to everyone's surprise, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, the shamed Public Health Minister, squeezes in through your window, having climbed a tree to your floor. "Whew... I think I've evaded those journalists! I agree that we must ensure this doesn't happen again. We ministers should be better supported in our appointments; we can only be as good as our briefings! A proper team of aides and analysts for all officials will ensure we don't get caught out again, even if it increases administrative costs. Oh, by the way, in case anyone asks you, it turns out Ebola is a type of disease!"

[3]. Rummaging through your desk for valuables, an uninvited burglar decides to comment. "If I may speak for us decent working folk, I can honestly only name one or two ministers in your Cabinet. Why? Because we, the people, didn't elect them. No one in government should be doing a job unless the public chose them for it. We must hold elections for all ministerial posts. There's only like six of them, aren't there?" [[color=blue]Must be democratic[/color]]

4. Your mother walks in with a tray of freshly baked cookies for everyone. "I don't know about all these big ideas; the problem is quite simple. Only you know how you want to run this country. It's all well and good having friends to help but I'm not sure they actually do anything. Surely you can do it all yourself, little darling; you shouldn't let anyone question your decisions or your absolute rule. Any spare politicians that won't bow out gracefully you should get rid of. Just give them a poisoned cookie or something." She smiles innocently as your Public Health Minister desperately spits out a mouthful of crumbs.

[b][anchor=1089]#1089[/anchor]: Woman Trouble [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Since you reaffirmed your government's opposition to female suffrage, a band of highly militant suffragettes have been causing trouble in @@CAPITAL@@, inflicting criminal damage on property and even employing violence against policemen.

The Debate
1. "Pah! This women's rights rubbish is all piffle and poppycock!" boos Henry Hasquith, your Minister of Misogyny and author of the scientifically dubious pamphlet [i]Women Have Squirrel Brains, and 999 Other Facts[/i]. "Women lack the temperament for politics, and they are more than adequately represented at the ballot by their fathers and husbands. If women stepped into this masculine sphere, nature would be destroyed; women would lose their sweetness and become masculinised. Suffragettes are palpably and demonstrably clinically insane. Lock these poor souls in an asylum, for compassion's sake, and give them every treatment to cure them of their morbid hysterias."

2. "I'd caution underestimating the so-called weaker sex," warns special branch police chief Brendon Steed. "These terrorist suffragettes are not ill; they are seditious criminals. They don't need to be rehabilitated, they need to be defeated! The very fabric of social order is at risk here - give me and my men the resources and permission to do what is needed, and we will break the back of this rebellion." He slaps a truncheon into a leather-gloved hand. "Literally."

3. "We have to face facts: these women aren't going away," mutters your pragmatic Minister of Solutions. "Maybe we should give them a little of what they think they want. Limited women's suffrage isn't going to hurt us, if we're careful about not giving them any real power. It's not like they'll use it, anyway. After all, some women have worked in trusted roles in @@NAME@@ for many years. But we shouldn't go around, implying suffrage is a right, regardless of stability or status. How about we grant women over thirty the vote, as long as they hold property, and pass an intelligence test that demonstrates they intend to vote for the right party? Surely that's a fair solution that everyone can live with."

*4. "This disparity cannot stand," shouts suffragette Christine Pankhurst, bursting into the room and hurling a Votes for Women banner at you. "For the laws we obey, for the taxes we pay, we demand our right to have a say! This deplorable oppression has forced us to do that which we would never do: break the law so that our own government will finally hear us! Yes, some commercial premises might have had their windows broken; some mail boxes may have been blown-up. But only by striking at @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ enterprise could we get you to listen. We were driven to desperation by your constant disregard of our plight. We are not law-breakers; we wish to be law-makers. And it is incumbent on you, @@LEADER@@, to give us the vote and a chance."

[b][anchor=1090]#1090[/anchor]:  I Ain't Afraid of No Girls [The Free Joy State; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
The all-female remake of the cult camp comedy film [i]Ghost-Smashers[/i] is the latest in a string of controversial female reboots of beloved media franchises. This trend has not gone unnoticed by the blogosphere, which has been alight with uneven reviews, some applause and thirty-page dissections of each line.

The Debate
1. "This is a desecration of a classic," reads a rant from the blog of InternetGenius72, who boasts in his bio that he is forty-five and can quote every line of the original [i]Ghost-Smashers[/i] backwards.  "The original wasn't about four chicks; it was about four [i]dudes[/i], okay?  Four dudes with cool shades and boilersuits and short-wave sonic matter-busters.  Now, they've turned it into four chicks, with [i]families[/i] and [i]feelings[/i] and they replaced the matter-buster with an ionising particle-blaster.  What's next?  The maverick cop movie [i]Dirty Harold[/i] remade as [i]Dirty Harriet[/i]?  I'm not a sexist or anything, but I want people to stop tampering with the classics.  Filmmakers should make something new — remakes and sequels always suck."

2. "The female-led reimagining of the iconic [i]Ghost-Smashers[/i] is one small step to placing women in the driving seat of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ cinema, and I say it's about bloody time!" shouts the host of feminist panel-show [i]HERstory[/i], looking nonplussed when people in the room don't cheer.  "@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ media has traditionally portrayed manhood as strong and powerful, while womanhood is depicted as the sweet and subservient helpmeet.  Well, I say we promote media that show men being sweet and women being the tough leaders of tomorrow they were born to be.  Can I get a whoop-whoop?"

3. Your computer pings with a message: "My name is @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, and I represent The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Kings, which aims to rebalance the power between men and these hussies.  First, they got the vote, but that wasn't enough.  Now they ruin our movies, looking without shame down camera lenses and swearing and flirting with men who don't even deserve a woman.  All while taking great parts from good men who would've been great actors.  It's time you put these uppity slatterns back in their place.  Ban womenfolk from playing any role that doesn't portray modest, sweet and submissive ladylike behaviour.  P.S. Porn is fine."

4. "All these people are crazy," mutters @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Film Appreciation Society.  "Nevertheless, it has to be said that there has been something of a dearth of quality parts for women and minorities.  And this [i]Ghoulie-Hitters[/i] — is that right? — hardly seems to redress the balance with its gaudy effects and lack of nuanced characterisation.  We must fund high-quality films that provide meaningful and intelligent roles depicting the trials of three-dimensional @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ men and women of all backgrounds.  Loud whizz-bang effects may be more attention-getting, but it's the stories and the people that truly matter."

The Issue
Due to a mix-up at the border, a number of immigrants have been sent backward, downward, upward and sideways to various detention centres across @@NAME@@. In the midst of the confusion, several thousand children have been separated from their parents.

The Debate
1. "Look, these migrants have [i]clearly[/i] violated the law! Clearly!" says your Head of Immigration @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ closely inspects the stamps on your passport. "Not only did they cross the border [i]illegally[/i], but then they have the gall to ask for citizenship. Sure, the children may not enjoy being separated from their parents, but that's what they get for breaking the law! If it was national policy for illegal immigrants to be treated as the criminals they are, to have their kids taken away, far fewer of them would come to our country. Guaranteed." @@HE@@ runs out of your office to pursue a worker with a Marche Noirian accent.

2. "Seriously?" gasps @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, who just got out of her latest therapy session with her eight-year-old child. "Look at my little @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@. @@HE@@ was separated from me at the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ border, taken away the moment I asked for asylum. @@HE@@ spent so many months in that state facility that @@HE@@ can hardly talk in Bigtopian, and @@HE@@ keeps trying to arrest the other young children in the playground! You must end this cruel immigration policy immediately. Your country needs more migrant workers, @@LEADER@@, and my @@BOY@@ needs @@HIS@@ mother. A child should never be separated from their parent!"

*3. "The whole immigration system is a joke!" says the proudly neutral lobbyist Neutron Neutralson, who changed his name from @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@-@@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ to prove a point. "Separating children from parents? Putting immigrants in jail? Deporting migrants back to the wrong country? Here's what we do: hire more staff and do more checks for undocumented migrants at the border. Just ask questions every @@DEMONYM@@ can answer and get proof of residency. If they are here illegally, send them straight back as a family. It's not hard to balance compassion with efficacy, for crying out loud!"

[b][anchor=1092]#1092[/anchor]: The Boys from Brasilistan [USS Monitor; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A report from your Intelligence Ministry reveals that an illegal lab deep in the jungles of Brasilistan has created several clones of the infamous genocidal dictator Lee Terallihitlah, a.k.a. "the Butcher of Bigtopia," and placed them with adopted families scattered around the world, including some in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "These children are a potential source of danger!" says death camp survivor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Think what would happen if one of them rose to power in @@NAME@@ and repeated Terallihitlah's crimes here. They have to be put under surveillance to make sure that never happens. And if they turn out not to be as evil, then we ought to be monitoring them to protect them from those with a misplaced sense of vengeance against them. Either way, everybody is safest if we keep a close watch."

2. "That's not enough!" yells Bigtopian human rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What if someone marries them without knowing? What if they have kids? Terallihitlah systematically murdered millions of Bigtopians because he believed we were genetically inferior. We can't allow his DNA to stay in the gene pool! These abominations must die!"

3. "What is wrong with you people?" civil rights lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ wants to know. "Don't we have anything better to do than judge people by their DNA? These children aren't Lee Terallihitlah and they haven't done anything wrong. It should be illegal to discriminate against people based on their genes."

4. "Hey, like, maybe we can use this," says controversial pop singer Britney Speer, as she bounces into your office dressed in a bizarre mix of sequins, body paint, and fascist regalia. "You can recruit the clones to work for you and have them travel the country promoting patriotism. What could possibly go wrong?"

The Issue
After a widely followed trial in which an ordinary citizen was prosecuted for tax evasion, insurance fraud, and serial jaywalking due to small legislative changes that were only implemented the previous month, many are questioning how changes in the law should be communicated to the general public.

The Debate
1. "It's not my fault I broke these idiotic new laws if I wasn't even aware they existed! How was I supposed to know that claiming my seven cats as dependents for tax purposes was no longer legal?" protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was recently convicted and is awaiting sentencing. "Every time new laws are put in place, there should be a two-month grace period before they can be enforced. Furthermore, to make sure each citizen is aware of the changes, the government should send regular updates on new legislation to every registered address in @@NAME@@. It's the only way to stop travesties like this from happening again!"

*2. "Nobody sends letters any more; what are you, a square?" taunts spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from Webflix, one of the largest digital streaming services. "Everyone gets their information from the internet now. Just incentivize all of the streaming services to regularly provide updates on new legislation. In fact, we could have our own show, hosted by celebrities like what's-@@HIS_1@@-name, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, and maybe even @@RANDOM_NAME@@. The people will love it!

4. "Why should the taxpayer fork out for information no one uses, or allow grace periods for corrupt people to repeatedly break laws and plead ignorance?" asks devoted penny-scrimper @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who appears to have helped @@HIM@@self to the entire contents of the candy dish in the lobby. "If someone wants to know something, they should have to find it out at their own expense by doing their own research.

The Issue
A complication arose yesterday when three ambassadors from the conservative nation of Althaniq had a meeting in @@NAME@@, only to find themselves surrounded by a bunch of naked diplomats.

The Debate
1. "You must do something about this outrageous impropriety!" exclaims Ambassador Myron Jakeem, trying his best not to look at you. "Your custom of nudism may be fine for you, but it's completely unacceptable in our culture. I beg of you to allow your people to wear proper clothing during international meetings - for the sake of human decency."

2. "Look, I'm not saying that everybody is a pretty sight," begins @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ diplomat @@RANDOM_NAME@@, making no effort to cover the more pendulous parts of @@HIM@@self. "But why should we pander to their culture? If anything, they should be showing respect for our ways. They need to loosen up: we should force them to disrobe when they come here. Once they've experienced the freedom of nudity, they'll appreciate how liberating it is!"

3. "Or, you know, you could just put some clothes on everyone," suggests your mom, as she hides her modesty behind the drapes. "It's not only diplomats who are finding this lack of a limitation restrictive! I honestly don't know where to look while I'm talking to your grandparents, frying food is downright painful, and don't even get me started on trying to go for a morning run. You must put an end to compulsory nudity!"

When the grass on a roadside patch of lawn in front of @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@'s house grew so long that a herd of wild deer moved in, the local council tried to force @@HIM@@ to mow it - a job @@HE@@ claims is not @@HIS@@ to do. Unexpectedly, this all-out turf war escalated over several months, till finally the problem has found itself on your doorstep.

The Debate
1. "It's a bloody outrage, it is!" complains @@RNAME_1@@, who has showed up wearing nothing but a grubby string vest and stained briefs that have seen better days. "Some whinging council nerd says it was me land to mow and I gotta mows it! So then I told 'em since it was me land, I can do whats I wants with it. Then they tell me it's their land, but I gotta mows it. Anyways, I tells 'em: if it ain't me land, then it ain't me bloody problem to mow the land, is it? If they want it mowed, they can bleedin' mow it themselves!"

2. "Surely you can't expect us to look after every nature strip in our local government area?" asks Councillor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving the red-ink-covered printout of the Local Authority's annual budget. "By the time we pick up litter and pull weeds, we'll need to be doubling our council rates! And when we do increase our rates, everyone chucks a stink! Force the idling bludgers to be socially responsible for once in their lives, and get them mowing!"

3. "The whole problem appears to be that it's not the resident's land," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Creative Solutions. "So what if we were to change that? Expand land rights out from the front door to the road. Homeowners get a land windfall, local authorities get to devolve responsibility. What could possibly go wrong?"

4. "Hard problems need hard solutions," observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, manager of ConcreteIsUs. "Why don't we just pave over the damned nature strip? That way it won't matter whose land it is as no one will have to mow it."

Upon allowing @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ to vote, it has come to light that elements in society are training large teams of them to vote for specific candidates and causes. With hordes of @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ forming an orderly line outside a nearby polling station, you decide to listen to a group of fervent bystanders.

The Debate
1. "Take a good, hard look at what we have become," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who, along with @@HIS@@ friends and family, have supported the same political party for decades. "Are you telling me it's a coincidence that their voting patterns are virtually identical? That they all willingly would vote against their own interest, like supporting candidates deep in the pockets of the agricultural-industrial complex? I'm telling you, animal-whispering yahoos are allowed to vote tens, even hundreds, of times through their 'associates'. It's unfair, and it's voter fraud. Clearly, we need to forbid @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ from voting."

2. "Don't say that around Mr. Puffles," lectures Mama @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, covering her pet's ears with a crochet scarf. "If @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ are being manipulated to vote a certain way, we need to find and crack down on those trying to abuse the system. In addition, you should install an unbiased program to teach @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ how to resist this kind of conditioning, allowing them to vote freely, of their own mind."

3. "With @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ this was bound to happen," whispers Milo Cesar in a Wezeltonian accent, while asserting his dominance over Mr. Puffles. "They are intelligent, yes, but crave leadership. It is only natural that they seek guidance. The real question is, who is best fitted to guide them? Perhaps it is you? My rates are very reasonable, and with discipline and affection - in that order - I will make you the leader of the greatest pack @@NAME@@ has ever seen."

[b][anchor=1097]#1097[/anchor]: What Do We Do With a Drunken Sailor? [Caracasus; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ navy has always allowed shore leave when docked at ports in the tiny allied nation of Prudenlund. However, after a brawl involving two hundred rowdy @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ sailors in Prudenlund's quiet city streets made international news, the admiralty has begun exploring ways to repair its image.

The Debate
1. "This... this is disgraceful!" states red-faced Rear Admiral @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "These sailors are acting like common hooligans! I say we round them up, court martial the ringleaders and forbid all shore leave for the foreseeable future. Our reputation is at stake here."

2. "It's not shore leave that's the problem here, it's the devil's nectar!" notes dour-faced Warrant Officer @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "Let our sailors have their shore leave, but forbid them from drinking. We'll just breathalyze them on their way back to the ship. As for any that fail... well, we can always break the old cat o' nine tails out of the naval history museum."

3. "A drop of @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@'s Blood never done us any harm!" chants Bosun's Mate @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, swaying slightly from side to side. "Getting hamm... er, drinking on shore leave is a sailor's right from time immemorial! Those stuck up Prudenlundians wouldn't know a good time if it smacked them round the head with a bottle! If they're so opposed to our lot enjoying themselves - then our ships should just avoid their ports and maybe we should stop trading with them too. That'll learn'em!"

4. "Now... now wait here just a minute..." slurs a queasy cadet who appears to have gatecrashed the meeting. "I've been talking to my mates, right... and we don't wanna be in the navy any more. We might have to kill people and that's kind of a downer... but on the bright side, we throw the best parties! Say, that's a thought - let's get rid of the whole navy nonsense and open up our warships for party cruises!"

Banning guns has reduced gun crime, but in its place knife crime is rising. A recent anonymous survey of teenagers suggests that a frighteningly high proportion of them carry a blade routinely.

The Debate
1. "My son was stabbed three times," weeps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, parent of a hospitalised teenager, "all because he looked at someone the wrong way. Well, yes, and spat in the girl's face. Sure, and he poked her once or twice with his finger... look, that's not the point! We have to ban concealed weapons of any sort!"

2. "A knife is a vital tool!" exclaims outdoorsman @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, using his Bowie knife to peel a banana. "Responsible adults like me shouldn't be punished! Just ban blade ownership till the age of majority; let grown-ups carry whatever blades they need to. Ouch!" He yelps as he nicks his finger.

3. "Tribes in the Kawandaland jungle give children knives to play with as soon as they can walk," observes hippy mum @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, handing her six-year-old son a bottle of bleach for his household chores. "Maybe if we trusted our children more, they'd learn responsibility at an early age.

"I can't believe one is reduced to this; I'm frankly dying of embarrassment here, old chap," mumbles @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, an adolescent highwayman waving a silver butter-knife at you as he tries to mug you.

[b][anchor=1099]#1099[/anchor]: New Satellite Blues [Ransium; ed: Pogaria] [/b]

The Issue
The @@NAME@@ Aeronautics and Space Administration (@@NAME_INITIALS@@ASA) is currently reviewing proposals for a new flagship satellite project. Debates about the merits of each plan have become so intense that a recent fight resulted in thousands of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in damage to pocket protectors, calculators, and glasses. Agency heads have therefore deferred to you to decide which project should be chosen.

The Debate
1. "This isn't rocket science!" states @@NAME_INITIALS@@ASA astronomer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@HIS@@ bow tie still ruffed and @@HIS@@ glasses askew from the recent funding fight. "@@NAME_INITIALS@@ASA needs to create wonder in the young and old alike, while also performing cutting-edge science. My proposed space telescope, Bubble, is the ideal tool for this. Think of what pictures it could take: supernovas in the process of erupting, crystal-clear images of nebulas on the shoulders of Orion, C-class stars glittering near Tannhäuser Galaxy. Without Bubble, all these moments will be lost, like tears in the rain."

2. "I find my colleague's position to be myopic and self-serving," declares remote sensing specialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is sporting a black eye and torn suspenders. "Who cares what's happening a million light-years away? Our real problems are much more local. Right now, man is causing rapid changes to the surface of our planet, endangering major ecosystems. The best way to understand these changes is from space. My proposed LANDSPOT satellite will be equipped with cutting-edge tools such as hyperspectral imaging and advanced LIDAR, giving us a whole new perspective on this little blue marble we call home."

*3. "Space may hold a terrible secret!" warns asteroid hunter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while rubbing @@HIS@@ knuckles. "Do you remember what happened to the dinosaurs? If we don't want to share the same fate, then the first step is arming ourselves with knowledge. My proposed Guardian satellite is specially designed to find and track the orbits of all potentially dangerous near-Earth objects. If we find something, we'll take the second step: arming ourselves against the asteroid by implementing my Star Battles missile shield project." [[color=purple]Must not have dinosaurs[/color]]

*4. "Space may hold a terrible secret!" warns asteroid hunter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while rubbing @@HIS@@ knuckles. "Do you remember what happened to the dinosaurs? I mean, before we brought them back?

**[5]."You think your average @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ on the street is going to care about any of those things?" asks the stylishly dressed CEO of Horizon Communications. "Doubtful. Now, tell them they'll be able to load a WhoTube video from their phone a whole second faster and I promise you they'll be interested. @@NAME_INITIALS@@ASA and Horizon must partner to create the most cutting-edge communications satellite the world has ever seen.

[[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]; [color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

7. "Don't listen to their lies!" whispers a wild-eyed stranger, while sneaking past your security. "The entire @@NAME_INITIALS@@ASA is actually conducting a program to broadcast subliminal messages straight into citizens' brains. I've been listening to their secret transmissions through my teeth fillings. They're playing you for a sucker, I tell ya! You must remove all funding from @@NAME_INITIALS@@ASA and divert it to things that do demonstrable good, like mental health services. I hear there are people out there that really need help."

[b][anchor=1100]#1100[/anchor]: Raiders of the Lost Archive [Helaw; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
News has reached your ears that a long-lost governmental document - known only as the [i]Directiones Ad Balneo[/i] - has been finally discovered by a group of archivists that had adventured deep into the immense @@CAPITAL@@ Archives. Not wanting to risk their lives with such spelunking again, the archivists have petitioned the government to properly organise all of its innumerable files and records.

The Debate
1. "We almost lost @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ to the jaws of a great book avalanche!" raves @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the archivist who led the expedition. "This whole thing was expensive, dangerous, and exhausting. You have to get your lackeys to go through every document we have and organise them, so that we don't have to endure something like this again. Your team has to be ruthless and destroy any document that's obsolete or redundant!" @@HE@@ grabs you tightly, and pulls you towards @@HIM@@. "Please, don't send me back into that maw of legality and horror."

2. "A disorganised library is one with character," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, picking up a discarded copy of a constitutional document. "These assortments of books act as reminders of our nation's past, and they can act as a blueprint for the future. We have placed these records here over the years to preserve them and use them as bricks in an architectural masterpiece of colossal scale; it would be unwise to recklessly catalogue them in the pursuit of some notion of organisation. Besides, our government is running just fine and we have more important things to worry about."

[3]. "It's time to move into the digital age!" decries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, brandishing a portable hard drive. "We can digitise every document we have, and release all of them for every person in @@NAME@@ to see! The wondrous power of both man and machine can help us learn from our past texts, and build something new and beautiful." [[color=blue]Computers are legal[/color]]

4. "What's to stop a thief from waltzing into those archives and stealing top-secret documents?" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prominent member of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ military. "It is clear that all of this bureaucratic faffing about is stifling @@NAME@@'s actions. I propose that we transfer all confidential files to the military's safe and secure hands, and rid ourselves of the other... disposable pieces of paperwork. After all, an efficient nation is one that does not look back into the pitiful past."

The Issue
A study in the journal [i]Periodical for Learning About the Sociological Misadventures of Audiovisuals[/i] has revealed that young adults who watch reality television are more likely to experience negative social interaction and emotional effects than their peers.

The Debate
1. "Reality television gives the impression that what is appearing on television is, in fact, realistic," complains lead researcher Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hiding @@HIS@@ [i]Television is for Squares[/i] badge beneath @@HIS@@ labcoat. "In fact, it's scripted and heavily edited fiction. Constant arguments, excessive expressed emotion, unrealistic body expectations, instant gratification: these lead to youths acting out in unacceptable ways and to a general negative inertia in society. All these shows should carry disclaimers to explain how reality is being misrepresented, and all schoolchildren must be taught about the distortions in these shows."

2. "Like my sister Chrissie says: don't be haters just 'cuz you ain't us," natters Christina Cholmondeley, of popular reality show [i]Crashing Out with the Cholmondeleys[/i], as she flicks her hair. "Reality TV is, like... what's the word? Not Alsatian... aspirational. We aspire kids to be better than they are. If they're fat and stupid, we make them want to be pretty and clever, like us. By acting like us, they can hope to be like us. Then they'll have their own brand of perfume, like [i]Chrissie C's Pong of Class[/i], which is on sale now, babe. Rather than oppress us, you should show your fans how awesome you are by being on our show... like, lots. @@NAME@@ needs our brand of style way more than political speeches."

3. "Objection!" shouts arbiter 'Judge Woody', who earns one million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ per show, as he bangs his gavel on your desk. "@@LEADER@@, that Cholmondeley moron is selling you manure and telling you it's chocolate. Does she think you're an idiot? Brain-dead shows like hers are the reason why young @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ have no motivation to get a real job. They see over-glossed and glossed-over lives, and think it all comes easy. Young people would be more focused if reality shows only showed serious professionals doing real jobs, and not lies about fame and fortune."

4. "The problem is the negativity," chimes preternaturally perky Baby Bebe Baker-Bell, who found fame as a child singing on [i]@@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ Have Talent (Honest!)[/i]. "Backstage, wranglers stir up spiteful competition between contestants. They goaded me into calling someone a 'meanie bo beanie'! I still wake up sweating. But maybe a better class of reality TV could instead nurture a pleasant society by encouraging participants to only be nice to each other, and by editing out the sad parts of life. Wouldn't it be lovely if everybody got along better?"

5. "We must escape from dreary reality," says @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, your nephew and a recent graduate of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Academy of Dramatic Art, as he strikes a stereotypically heroic stance. "By forcibly reallocating all reality TV slots and funding, we could tell intelligent stories and pay good wages to highly skilled actors who have a classic face suited to play either the dashing lead or the brooding baddie. Noir mysteries, sultry sagas in country houses, earthy dramedies, pulsating thrillers, period pieces of pride, prejudice and penury; with funding, we could usher in a golden age of quality @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ drama."

The Issue
Inmate @@RANDOM_NAME@@ died in prison yesterday after years of battling cancer. The death of the prisoner has prompted humanitarian groups to call for a compassionate release policy for terminally ill and elderly inmates.

The Debate
1. "A portion of our imprisoned population lives in holding cells when they really belong in hospice care," says well-known philanthropist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wringing @@HIS@@ hands over the images of bedraggled inmates in grimy cells that @@HE@@ has spread across your desk. "A compassionate release system will allow these inmates to live out their days free from the encumbrance of incarceration. Yes, they might be criminals, but anyone who considers the elderly, debilitated, or dying a danger to society should consider a wellness check themselves."

2. "We can't just release inmates every time they get a hangnail," wheezes sickly-looking former sheriff @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ slaps a truncheon in @@HIS@@ palm. "Sure, compassionate release might cut costs, but at what cost to the community? Tell me, what's stopping these crazies from going on crime sprees following their release? Arthritis? Keep these people in prison, @@LEADER@@! Convicts should serve the entirety of their sentences, even if it means they get paroled out the back door."

3. "I'm all in favor of keeping criminals off the streets, but prison infirmaries aren't adequately equipped or staffed to handle inmates who often end up sick, stabbed, or sometimes both," declares prison nurse @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ shows you over a dozen shanks @@HE@@ has collected from @@HIS@@ patients. "I mean, the sheer number of items one can substitute for a surgical suture is impressive and all, but @@NATION@@ should really invest in prison medical facilities and personnel capable of supporting all who dwell within the walls."

[b][anchor=1103]#1103[/anchor]: Dàguó Takeaway [Australian rePublic; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
Dàguó companies with ties to their autocratic government own a wide range of power stations, water processing plants and railway lines in @@NAME@@. One such company has expressed interest in buying yet another asset: the Port of @@CAPITAL@@.

The Debate
1. "You can't be serious!" gestures @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Dàguó defector who owns a lucrative business in @@NAME@@, yet is too afraid of @@HIS@@ birth country to list @@HIS@@ company on the stock market. "They poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto us! Well not yet, but are we just gonna sit around and wait until they do? Dàguó's not exactly benign on the geopolitical stage. By allowing them to invest in our commodities, we're potentially jeopardising our national security. We need to block the sale of any asset to Dàguó."

2. "This is very counter-productive!" declares Dàguó's ambassador @@RANDOM_NAME@@, accidentally allowing you a glimpse of @@HIS@@ list of spies posing as construction workers. "Companies from Dàguó have brought in plenty of capital to @@NAME@@, and have built and invested in a great deal of infrastructure. Dàguó projects are ultimately good for @@NAME@@ and it's offensive to suggest that our companies are problematic simply because they are owned by the Dàguó government."

3. "If we didn't sell off our important infrastructure in the first place, we wouldn't have this problem, would we?" states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ uses a stack of Communist Manifestos as an impromptu soapbox. "Privatising our assets is a terrible practice; the supposed benefits have not been delivered to the people. As such, we should nationalise all corporate property right away."

The Issue
After selling just 187 copies, [i]How to Repair Your Cat for Dummies[/i] was shockingly still the national #1 best-seller this year. In response, a small group of effete, sweater-vest-clad bookworms have used copies of [i]War and Peas[/i] to barricade themselves in your office.

The Debate
1. "That's truly shameful," sighs local librarian @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pulling a copy of [i]The Visible Hand[/i] from within the deep pockets of @@HIS@@ overcoat. "The solution is subsidizing books. The reduced prices will encourage @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to buy a good ol' book again. Infinite knowledge is waiting just behind those pages, @@LEADER@@. Folks just need a little nudge."

2. "It's not their choice anymore," declares your Minister of Education, while reluctantly putting down a copy of [i]The Complete Works of Shakespeare[/i]. "People don't realize what they are losing by not reading. If @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ stopped watching 'The Brash and the Backstabbing' and actually read something, we'd have a more interesting, enlightened, and productive populace. For everyone's sake, make it mandatory to read a book every month."

3. "What about us?" asks the best-selling author Bax Marry, already signing a copy of his feline mending manual without you asking. "We are the ones that need help. It took five years of hard work and painful scratches to figure out how to properly cauterize a cat's cataract. You know what we need? A little incentive to keep us inspired to make great masterpieces. Establish a government-sponsored workshop to help up-and-coming writers. I could teach them a few lessons I learned while writing my smash hit."

4. "Uggh, if you can't write in three sentences or less you're being overly wordy," mutters one of your secretaries, while briefly scanning a summary of the erudite malcontents' requests. "If people don't want to read a lot, why force them?"

Inspired by the message of environmentalism, @@RANDOM_NAME@@ — the latest scion of an old family — decided to install solar panels on @@HIS@@ home. However, his house is also the centuries-old Summer Palace, a world-famous and highly-prized example of 18th-century @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ architecture.

The Debate
1. "Well, I say @@LEADER@@, this is all fuss over nothing," asserts @@LASTNAME_1@@, while inspecting the nutritional information on the side of a green juice box. "The world will be a wonderful place once everyone pitches in to save the environment. These solar panels cover all the electricity and heating needs of my sixty bedroom ancestral home. I think your government should follow in my footsteps! Put solar panels on every government property to show the world that we mean to take a stand against climate change! Think of the future!"

2. "Simple vandalism, that's what this is," rages Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a lecturer in Enlightenment history, putting @@HIS@@ fist through a priceless stained glass window as @@HE@@ waves @@HIS@@ arms around in anger. "This palace is a unique structure, with key architectural experiments in its design. To cover up the world famous tile-work would be an eyesore and an irreparable blow to historical preservation!

3.

"We should seize this and other oversized homes as state property, and reassign the living space on a fairer basis to house the homeless.

Teen pop star @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@ @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ decided to celebrate her birthday and "just legal" status by selling her virginity to the highest bidder. The online auction has now closed, with the winning bid not far off the national average for six months' wages.

The Debate
1. "This is my body and my choice," squeaks @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@ in her annoying trademark high pitch lil' girl voice. "Me and the buyer - whose identity I will absolutely keep confidential - are consenting adults engaging in free market capitalism. Just like in my new song, released next week: [i]Free Love Doesn't Come Cheap[/i]. By the way, have you seen your brother round here? I have a... uh... delivery for him."

2. "This is totally demeaning to womankind!" complains ardent feminist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, her gaze lingering a little too long on the popster's posterior as she leaves the room. "If you care at all about preventing objectification, about human dignity, about the unhealthy false assignation of value to virginity, about the last hundred years of feminist progress, you have to take a stand! Ban this online prostitution, and put money into teaching young girls why they should respect themselves more!"

3. "Half a year's wages!" exclaims your Minister of Equality Juan King in disgust. "And how are the working poor meant to afford a price like that? Everybody should be entitled to a happy ending, not just wealthy fat-cats. You have to set a fixed price tariff for these services, as well as guarantees that a contract will be honoured, rather than leaving customers and prostitutes at the mercy of a free market."

Party membership applications have never been higher; however, the quality of applicants has never been lower. After nearly one third of new members mistakenly identified a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ revolutionary hero as a popular soap opera star, and nearly two thirds thought that dialectics was something found in tea and coffee, various factions within your party have put aside their bitter rivalries to propose solutions.

The Debate
1. "Our revolution is in danger," bellows @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Junior Undersecretary for Defence and self-described Party Loyalty Commissar. "Every member, new or old, should attend a five hour theoretical Maxist-Lenyoist seminar and vigorously study the [i]Quotations from @@LEADER@@[/i]. Based on this, they must undergo a compulsory loyalty test. If after all of that they still prove to be disloyal hangers-on, a few years mining salt should change their minds."

2. "Well, that's a bit extreme, don't you think?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leaning well out of the way of the flying spittle. "This serious lack of interest surely shows an underlying frustration with our Party's monolithic approach. We should open ourselves up to debate and discourse from every tendency, not just the ones that can learn to parrot party slogans. After all, are we not at our best when we are butting heads in perpetual argument?"

3. "Look on the bright side: Party membership has never been higher," states ruthless pragmatist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Does it really matter if the cat is black or white so long as it catches mice?

The Debate
*1. "Let's be realistic here," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, President of the Manufacturing Alliance of Liquor Traders. "These home operations simply do not have the training, the experience, the equipment, or the political connections to be permitted to make their own whiskey! It's all well and good that they talk about freedom, but the members of my association paid good money for their manufacturing licenses, and we maintain the highest standards of quality and purity. The government needs to protect us! People must not be allowed to make their own booze at home." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. "Let's be realistic here," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Director of the Home Oversight Panel for Spirits. "These unsanctioned operations simply do not have the training, the oversight, or the political authorization to be permitted to distill their own spirits! It's all well and good that they talk about seizing the means of production, but the state-run manufactories exist for a reason, and we maintain the highest standards of quality and purity.

5. "The bracing effect of a strong drink is absolutely top-notch for getting through the day!" opines Ebrius Foppington, a bearded gentleman wearing a top hat and monocle. "Why, I myself have several such drinks each morning, noon, and night! It helps keep the humors in balance, and makes socializing quite rather more tolerable.

The Issue
After last week's highly anticipated release of the new horror movie "Scary Dream on Fifth Street", reports have been coming in that movie theaters across @@CAPITAL@@ have been allowing children as young as five to watch the film despite the recommendation of ratings boards that the film is suitable only for adults.

The Debate
1. "Oh, the horror!" exclaims @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, president of watchdog group Mothers For Kids' Safeguarding. "The parts with the eating of the brains, the horrible mutilations, that policeman with liberal politics... it was so gut-churningly disgusting, even I stopped watching! These children will be scarred for life! It's time to crack down on movie theaters that are harming our younger generation: everyone, without exception, must provide proof of their age, and any who allow children to watch films rated for adults should be fined and prosecuted!"

2. Seven-year-old @@RANDOM_NAME@@ has seen the movie in question and disagrees. "I liked the film. I especially enjoyed the part where the zombie tore off the man's arms. My mommy says that because I'm a kid, I shouldn't see this movie, but I think the ratings aren't really rules. They're just someone's advice, right?

Foreign tourists visiting your nation's cities have frequently commented on the high number of vagrants, beggars and panhandlers, especially around the major attractions. Now that the world-renowned [i]Fat Tyreman Travel Guide[/i] has felt the need to specifically write an article called "10 Ways to Dodge Beggars in @@CAPITAL@@", it's probably time you addressed this national embarrassment.

The Debate
1. "Get gone, scum!" commands a police patrolman, displacing a camp of itinerants from a historic park. He turns to you. "Boss, we need more leeway in how we persuade vagrants to move on. I'm not talking about extreme measures here, just judiciously applied threats of arrest, the occasional tap from a truncheon, and maybe a water cannon or two."

2. "You think they want to beg?" complains homeless left-wing protest musician Billy Boast, as he tries to free himself from the policeman's grip. "We, the poor, are being trodden down by the rich. All we want is our fair share! I'm not talking about a socialist revolution here, just a few million social housing units and enough money for the bare necessities of life!"

3. "The problem isn't begging in general, but specifically beggars ruining the ambience of culturally significant sites," observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, from the Tourism Board. "Instead, subsidise construction of fences and walls around tourist attractions, so that only those that have an appropriately pricey entry ticket can enter the tourist areas.

The Issue
Following your decision to shoot all stray animals, several "friendly fire" incidents have occurred where household pets have been killed.

The Debate
1. "Not my fault if owned pets look like strays, is it? You should force every pet to be registered nationally, and to wear a collar with a name tag saying who they belong to," suggests Animal Control Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hefting a rifle with a prominent kill tally notched onto the gun's stock. "They can then be taken in, have their owners notified, and be picked up. Of course, if their owners are non-responsive, or they have no identification, then we can safely assume that they're feral and then... BANG!"

2. "Do you know how expensive that'll be?" shouts your Minister of Finance. "Animal control is expensive enough already! Besides, think of all of those poor animals, being killed for nothing. The solution is clear to me. We need to respect the city's ecosystem, and ban the killing of urban wildlife, once and for all."

3. "Why do people have pets anyway?" sniffles allergy-prone police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was bitten by @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@ earlier in the day. "Domestic animals are filthy and vicious, and a burden on society. If we banned them, then animal control officers could shoot any animals they see on the street without worry."

The Issue
Since reproductive sex was banned, a vocal group of slightly twitchy people have formed. Calling themselves the [i]Anti-Sex League[/i], they have attracted members from across society into their ranks, including one of your aunts, two uncles and three senior Ministers. They have taken a lifelong vow of celibacy, claiming recreational sex is a needless distraction in the age of vats.

The Debate
1. "Recreational intercourse is a waste of energy that @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ [i]could[/i] spend productively," huffs @@RANDOMFEMAENAME@@, the League's red sash tightly wound around her hips and swishing as she jogs ceaselessly on the spot. "With compulsory chemical castration the sex instinct would be eliminated. Then @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ would choose to attend community classes on woodwork and entomology, go on long nature hikes and take part in nonstop energetic sports to burn off excess tens... just because they're fun."

2. "This crazy broad may be onto something," mutters your Minister for the Propagation of Leader-Love. "Your every thought is of pleasing @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@, @@LEADER@@. You would die for them. @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ must learn that and think of nought but pleasing you, perhaps dying for your love.

Punish these ingrates who reject the purest love the world has ever known by having any 'relationships'."

[3]. "Is that the best you can do?" cackles the Minister of Machiavellianism, twirling his rather stylish pencil moustache. "Puh-lease! I could have coughed that up before breakfast. Picture this: with no contraception, these women get accidentally sprogged-up. We need, ahem, willing sacrifices to the gods or whatever we do human sacrifice for. Hey, if some sad cows don't want their brats sacrificed, they shouldn't have done the four-legged foxtrot."

"Of course, no-one wants to bring children into the world viviparously. We're not sick! We... general, nonspecific people want to have children as nature intended, in a governmental vat. By distributing free contraception to all and permitting abortion, you'd enable people to enjoy an affectionate relationship with their partner without breaking the law."

6. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, of the [i]Anti-Pleasure League[/i], opens @@FIRSTNAME_1@@'s book and hurls it across the room, making hand-gestures to ward-off evil.

The Debate
1. "Imagine the disrespect it must take to do something like this," resents @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your bodyguard, while pacing up and down the sidewalk. "We are being generous enough to allow these people into our country, and they can't even show their support by flying our flag? Despicable.

This morning, you were informed that the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Broadcasting Company is set to air a documentary on the legalization of needle exchanges in Skandilund. These provide sterile needles and allow safe injection sites for addicts to use recreational drugs without fear of arrest. Going by the small crowd gathered outside your office, it appears you weren't the only one to hear about the documentary.

The Debate
1. "My gorgeous little @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ would have been saved if she'd been allowed to inject safely in a public place!" wails @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@, who lost @@HIS@@ daughter to an intravenous heroin overdose last month. "She is not alone - thousands of people die preventable deaths every year as a result of this unfair policy. Not only should we legalize these safe sites, but also provide state counseling and rehabilitation for anybody that looks like she or he may be a drug addict. Why have one death when you can have none?"

2. "I'll just go out on an ominously scarred limb and say that this is a load of nonsense," dryly notes retired sheriff @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, in between discrete sips from a hip flask.

While waiting for a table at the so-called "best restaurant in @@CAPITAL@@", you are told that the chicken has run out, the soufflé is suffering and the vegetable stock is out of stock. Meanwhile, the head chef has defected to the United Federation and the waiters are too proudly socialist to be servile. Despite all this, there's such a mismatch of supply and demand for restaurants that the proletariat have to wait three months to book a table.

The Debate
*1. "Face facts, communism and fancy restaurants are ideologically incompatible," asserts waiter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spitting in a glass, then giving it a polish with a dirty rag. "You need food that reflects our great nation. This, for example, is 'jellyfish with binoculars', a dish from the revolution." @@HE@@ drops a plate in front of you of gelatin chicken and two large shot glasses of vodka. "Restaurants should return to honest proletarian food, for the noble worker. No menus, one dish only, but served with two great things: alcohol and community." [[color=blue]Alcohol is legal[/color]]

And yes, @@LEADER@@, I'm aware you've banned alcohol. An honest error, I presume?" [[color=red]Alcohol is illegal[/color]]

3. "Drinking till your taste buds go numb is not a solution, comrade," lectures rock farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dragging in a large iron cauldron with a heavy stone rolling around the bottom of it. "The communalist answer here is Proletariat Gumbo — a dish by the people, for the people! Have every diner bring something to add to the restaurant's cooking pot, and in exchange they get a nice bowl of tasty stew. Grated cheese for the greater good. An onion for everyone. A stake in the people's steak!"

4. "Quality service industries can exist in planned economies," insists Minister for the People's Palate @@RANDOM_NAME@@, frowning as @@HE@@ adds a pinch of paprika to the empty cauldron. "We just need to sort out the logistics chains, dedicate state resources to retraining farmers and factory workers into being chefs and waiters, convert high-end weapon factories into haute cuisine restaurants and create a fair system of meal ticket distribution.

The Issue
The [i]Durum Pulsaverit Academy[/i] — a private educational institution for the offspring of an order of black-clad believers — has caused controversy when it was recently discovered that it was illegally administering corporal punishment on students for a variety of offences, including talking in class and poor penmanship.

The Debate
1. "Our accusers make it sound like there's something cruel going on," intones the school's headmaster Killsin Barbon, who has a bimonthly lifestyle advice column in the order's magazine: [i]The Dour Digest[/i]. "They see not that it is done in love. A love of inflicting pai... piety. Youth is born wicked — disobedient, full of sin and forever questioning that which it pleases not their superiors to tell them — and such wickedness must be driven out. Our graduates are perfect citizens. Their sin-natures of treason and reason ripped from them, they then go through life as a meek and pure-minded mass. You should bring back corporal punishment in all schools. A beating a day keeps the badness at bay."

2. "Merciful Violet! What unnecessary brutality," tuts @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, headmistress of the [i]Creator of Good Counsel Academy[/i]. "Our Creator would never sanction such cruelty on the wayward cherubs. You can discipline them without harshness: writing ten thousand lines, scrubbing graffiti from the wooden desks with a toothbrush, holding a dictionary in each outstretched arm. Teachers who resort to violence show a clear lack of training. All teachers must be taught more functional methods of managing recalcitrant munchkins, and given the necessary tools."

3. "In the name of Her Jaundicedness, no!" An alarmed Marigold @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, Tranquil Yellowist and teacher from the [i]Golden Light Academy[/i], drops the daisy chain she's been making. "This obsession with sin and punishment is precisely why so many see all religious people as nutjobs. Religious-run academies must report any staff member or parent who is suspected of breaking the law to the police, suspending staff from duty until the matter's resolved. All schools must also submit to regular and thorough surprise inspections to prove they are the safe havens they ought to be."

4. "This is why religious schools are harmful," says atheist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Religious schools like [i]Durum Pulsaverit[/i] barricade themselves with closed ideas, and augment them with abusive threats of eternal damnation. Look at this ten-year-old's physics test: 'How does electricity work?', answer: 'We can't know'; 'Why does electricity work?', answer: 'The Creator did it'. The kid got full marks! We should close every religious school, and put the children in state-run secular schools to focus on provable knowledge and scientific fact."

1. "My client's partner was killed in this incident and @@HE@@'s demanding answers!" exclaims litigator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, throwing a stack of folders on your desk. "Hundreds of petitioners, including many of my clients — ah, and the other victims' families — will not be contented with the status quo. They need to know that their loved ones who go to work on these sites will most definitely come home at night. Instituting more safety guidelines might slow down the rate of construction work, but that just means more time to earn a living!"

2. "Objection!" cries prominent attorney @@RANDOM_NAME@@, representing construction firm Bricks An' Stuff. "These destructive laws would merely hinder businesses' ability to perform their job: providing houses to our beautiful citizens, storefronts to our busy workers, and hotel skyscrapers to our guests!" @@HE@@ pats down @@HIS@@ suit before handing you a trunk filled with legislation suggestions.

Oh, who are you kidding: powerful tobacco interests, wheelbarrows full of money in tow, have come to your office begging for the law to change.

The Debate
*1. "Productivity has declined in workplaces across the nation and we've got thousands of acres of tobacco plantations going fallow," states ex-Commissar for the Nicotine Production Committee @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The noble worker deserves their smoke break; who are we to take that away from them? Besides, what self-respecting socialist figure would be seen dead without a cigar clenched firmly in their teeth?

[[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

*2. "Think of the economic impact of the ban," begs former Nicotine 'R Us CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Tobacco farmers letting their fields go fallow, convenience store workers closing shop after losing their most lucrative products, advertisement agencies forced to switch to making Saturday morning kids cartoons, and yes, the employees of the tobacco companies sent to the poor house. Why, it's tragic!" @@HE/SHE@@ carefully wipes away a single tear with a check for a million bits, and discretely stuffs it into one of your pockets.

**3. "Dude, this tax revenue talk has me thinking," murmurs scruffy looking economics professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who smells distinctly skunky to you. "On the one hand, legalizing tobacco and taxing it to the gills will bring in more revenue. On the other hand, legalizing all drugs and taxing them all to the gills will bring in even more revenue, which will then let you lower income taxes. It'll be a total economic multiplier effect... or something. Hey, did you know the word 'hand' is just the word 'and' with an 'h' at the beginning? Freaky." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**4. "It's not just the tobacco plantations that aren't at full capacity," states scruffy looking economics professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sporting a shirt that bears the slogan 'Addiction is a Spook'. "Land across @@NAME@@ could be converted to marijuana plantations, poppy fields, and meth labs.

5. "Is @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ health really for sale?" asks your personal doctor, stethoscope pressed to your chest. "Are kids growing up with parents who are bed ridden due to emphysema worth a few more bits in the coffers of @@NAME@@? How about hospital beds full of lung cancer victims?

The rulers of three distant kingdoms have all requested permission to enter @@NAME@@ and visit the small town of Betraisa during a specific week this year. When asked for an explanation, they each disclosed that a keen interest in astrology had led them to believe that a long-prophesied religious teacher and leader of mankind would soon be born there. When pressed for further details about how to identify this individual, however, they all decided that letting your government know any more might not be the wisest thing to do.

The Debate
1. "Hallelujah!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Culture, Religious Affairs, and Tourism. "We must welcome this opportunity, aid those three kings in their visit, and honour the Prophet-to-be! We will surely improve our chances of salvation... and attract more tourists in the future, too. Yes, these visitors might end up starting a bizarre cult, but we should support religious freedom, right?"

2. "Who do these wise guys think they are, wanting to waltz into our country and proclaim that a baby has higher authority than your own?" scoffs @@RANDOMFIRSTAME@@ Herod, your Head of Internal Security Services. "I suppose we could try letting the kings in and following them to see whether they all select the same newborn as this prophesied one. If that does happen, you surely don't want any potential rivals, do you? Wouldn't it be a pity if Betraisa Hospital's maternity ward burnt down at the end of that week, killing everybody inside? That sounds like just the sort of thing those Ultra-Violetist terrorists could be blamed for."

3. "Isn't your sister due to give birth soon?" inquires @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the overly ambitious civil servant who is taking notes at this meeting. "Perhaps you might arrange for her to do so in Betraisa, proclaim your new nephew as this prophesied Holy One, and then appoint yourself as the child's designated spokesperson.

4. "Bah, humbug! What utter nonsense!" retorts Ebenezer @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, your Minister for Information.

The Debate
1. "Those savages murdered my brother!" states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pummelling your desk in a fit of rage. "As they clearly don't understand concepts like 'respect for the rule of law', you should bomb the island and send them back to the Stone Age!

2. "And risk going to war with Wezeltonia?" rebuts your Minister of Defense while folding out a map of the region. "Look, I sympathize that one of our citizens was killed, but frankly @@HE@@ should have known better. That island is clearly marked as off-limits by the Wezeltonian government. What we need to do is pressure their government to step up patrols to ensure that this tragedy never happens again, allowing this tribe to develop as nature intended.

The Debate
1. "A tragic loss that shouldn't occur in this fair city," mourns doctor Cathy Gratwick, filing through Gadsby's clinical history. "Politicians dosing too highly on drugs such as MDMA is not only a way to bring about a fatality, but also distracts you folks from your important work! As a policy wonk without flaws, you must stand up to this display by disavowing any kind of drugs."

2. "I think you should know that my pop would focus on our town most of all," sobs Gadsby's son, Barry. "Don't think about him so much as what you could do to honor him: continuing to build and maintain a thriving city. That is what brought about a proud spirit in Dad."

3. "Oh, look, focusing on @@CAPITAL@@ again," groans Patrick Picard, mayor of a tiny rural municipality. "Big woop. This big shot had it coming. Stop crying about him and start funding, in contrast, stuff that's actually important. Such as, I don't know, transportation to backwoods burgs."

Only a week before the anniversary of the day you took office, one of the holiest days of the year for the Cult of Nationalist Divinity, several impudent blasphemers have demanded that you show the people a sign of your divinity or else they will not attend the day's services and festivities.

The Debate
1. "We know you're not a god, but we have to keep the people thinking that you are one," asserts your Minister of Greasing the Wheels, attempting to hide a bag of silver. "Invite the blasphemers over to your office and pay each of them to say that you personally gave them a sign, and they now believe in you. This way, you can keep everyone under the illusion that you are divine without trying to devise some complicated trick. A few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ go a long way, Great One."

2. "Oh Almighty @@LEADER@@, punish these fools!" shouts the bearded founder of the Cult of Nationalist Divinity, who is also your Minister of Dogma, as the holy guards seize the previous speaker for blasphemy. "I would advise Your Holiness to end their disgusting lives with the fire of your divine wrath. Unworthy as I am, I suggest that you demonstrate your infinite power in the form of your acolytes using Holy Hand Grenades to blow your enemies to tiny bits, in your mercy. That will undoubtedly be a sufficient sign for all those who dare question your divinity!"

3. "It is not our place to tell the Ever-Magnificent what sign to perform!" comes the muffled voice of a believer prostrate on the floor. "The Supreme @@LEADER@@ can and surely will reveal to the unbelievers thy sacred truth in the way most appropriate according to thine most omniscient judgement. There is no need for smoke and mirrors when thou art truly an omnipotent god, certainly. Oh @@LEADER@@, the world will gasp in awe at thy divine majesty, if it is your will!"

4. "If I may, Most Gracious @@LEADER@@, it seems to me that a sign would defeat the purpose," states a progressive young cultist. "Those who only believe in your divinity because of a sign do not have true faith in your sublime providence; they only fear your divine justice. Perhaps, in your mercy, you might allow freedom of religion and choose not to display your power, so that the people can have the chance to experience other faiths and realize how shallow they are. They will know how glorious and merciful of a deity you are. If they still don't believe in you after your show of magnanimity, well, then you would have separated the wheat from the chaff and the faith will be purer for it."

Due to a nasty storm delaying @@HIS@@ journey, @@HE@@ wasn't able to return until after angry unionists had set up an impromptu picket line in the corridor outside your office. @@HE@@ claimed the pressure of the negotiations demanded @@HE@@ have a cigarette, and the only place @@HE@@ could legally smoke was at home.

The Debate
1. "This is stupid," rants your agitated Minister, not seeming to be particularly soothed from @@HIS@@ clandestine smoke break. "When I need to smoke, I need to smoke, dagnabbit. Is second-hand smoke a bit carcinogenic? Maybe, but so is just about everything, and I don't see these worrywarts advocating a goddamn paint ban. End this ban on public smoking, and I guarantee people will be way more flippin' happy and productive."

2. "Smokers' rights end where my health begins," retorts your massage therapist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while attempting to loosen a knot in your back. "How can you take deep soul-cleansing breaths when the air is filled with smoke? You should ban this bad habit altogether. After all, with smoking legal at home, you're still making kids pay for their parents' nasty habits. If nicotine addicts want a buzz, they can discretely use some gum or a patch."

3. "You could just designate public smoking areas across @@NAME@@," shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from a small park across the street from your office, though you struggle to hear her over the din of the rain. "People who don't want to be exposed to smoke can avoid them and smokers don't have to be so inconvenienced."

The Issue
Yesterday you spent several hours developing solutions to a complex sewage management dilemma that you had read about in a report in your desk drawer, only to realise today that this report was written eight years ago and that the problem was solved six years ago. Any one of the ministers, engineers or bureaucrats you consulted with yesterday could have told you this, but no-one did.

The Debate
1. "Uh, begging your pardon, oh wise and glorious leader," pleads engineer @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, "but we have always been told that you are an infallible and ultimate authority, so we assumed you knew that the problem was already solved and that you were simply testing us in some way. With your permission, we will challenge that assumption in future, and speak our minds. Uh, as long as we don't get punished for doing so! Please don't hurt me!" 

2. "@@LEADER@@, you are [i]of course[/i] infallible," shouts your head of secret police, moving in to put handcuffs on the engineer, "and this worthless wretch has failed the loyalty test! Guards, take him away!"

3. "I think what we're trying to say here is that you knew all along that the problem was solved," weasels smug-faced vizier @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "However, you've found a more appropriate and elegant solution for the sewage dilemma, which admittedly costs more than the existing solution and may back up the occasional toilet, but which is superior for politically expedient reasons that mere sewage engineers and plumbers could not hope to understand. I will assemble workers, and order the old system to be replaced, immediately."

In the past few months, there have been a series of high-profile car accidents involving elderly citizens.

The Debate
1. "I've had it with the elderly!" roars angry motorist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose car recently lost a wing mirror to a near-blind senior. "It's high time the government did something about this! Make all the elderly citizens retake their driving tests every five years from age sixty, so that granddad doesn't go killing someone his old eyes can't even see!"

2. "Now you listen here, dearie," interjects your aged grandmother, who has complained her way past your receptionists and guards. "I didn't work my stockings off when I was younger just so I could have my rights taken away! Your grandfather fought in a war back in... in... or maybe he didn't, I can't remember. Anyway, you've got to show some respect for my generation! Do it for Granny, won't you?"

3. "Oi, let me talk!" yells Dan Jerrus, a youth who recently drove his hatchback into the back of a sharply-braking nonagenarian's camper van. "These old crones shouldn't be allowed on the road, full stop. Just look what they did to my car! You should ban anyone over the age of fifty from driving. Leave the roads to responsible younger people."

Vociferous celebrity atheist and scientist Professor Albert Finn E. Grinch recently visited a classroom of five-year-olds in the sleepy town of Bahumburg, and caused a stir by telling them that Santa Claus wasn't real. Needless to say, he's not too popular right now.

The Debate
1. "What sort of monster ruins the magic of childhood like that?" complains mall Santa @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, as he dispenses free candy canes to your wide-eyed interns.  "This was a callous and deliberate attempt to cause unhappiness to little tykes — hell, destroying a child's wonder borders on child abuse!

5. "Heh, why is everybody so angry?" asks your brother, popping a dislodged tooth under his pillow in the hope that he'll get an Iot in the morning. "I mean, anyone who doesn't believe in Santa doesn't get presents from him, so it's their loss. I guess you should make a speech reminding everyone in the nation that good folk like you and me would never voice such doubts.

After the People's Panel into Proletarian Procreation discovered that the vast majority of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ women rated their marital activities as "meh", "mediocre" or "soporific", a meeting has been called to look into improving bedroom shenanigans across the nation.

The Debate
1. "Dear me, after a hard day's work at the plant and then coming home to washing and cooking, the last thing on my mind is a bit of how's your father," exclaims exasperated riveter @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_1@@, who appears so hard pressed for time that she's folding laundry during the meeting. "Look, I thought this revolution was supposed to make us all equal — so why don't you drag some of the men back home and get them to clean their own dirty clothes for once? While you're at it, some communal launderettes and kitchens couldn't hurt."

2. "Marriage is a bourgeoisie concept, comrade," claims @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, discreetly leering at an attractive young undersecretary. "Is it any wonder that @@FIRSTNAME_1@@'s husband can't rock her world? They've been married so long there's barely any spark left. Do away with the outdated notion of one person belonging to another, replacing possessive reactionary marriages with revolutionary free love, and we'll soon put the lead back into people's pencils." 

3. "It's degrading and demeaning depictions of women that's softening our collective resolve," notes prudish political officer Comrade @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "Don't let this fool palm you off here, @@LEADER@@. The solution is simple: get rid of pornography, clamp down on prostitution and promote healthy non-sexualised depictions of women! I'm sure that, without all those distractions at hand, people will rise to the occasion once more."

The Issue
An already turbulent day of trading on the @@NAME@@ Stock Exchange went catastrophically sideways a few weeks ago when the market suddenly plunged 10% in mere minutes, then spiked back up again nearly as fast. Investigation of this flash crash has revealed that it was caused by deliberate market manipulation that exploited the behaviors of automated black boxes—computerized trading systems that buy and sell without human intervention.

The Debate
1. "What we saw was the effect of algorithms reacting with millisecond timing to incomplete data," concludes Exchange Commission Chairperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ wraps up a soporific three hour presentation. "A series of spoofed false sell orders caused HFT algorithms to react and drive down prices by playing 'hot potato' with each other. Then, the bad actor cancelled the sales and purchased thousands of contracts at the new price in order to dump them for profit on the rebound! We must install safeguards, maybe rate throttles and circuit breakers, to keep this from happening again" Seeing glassy-eyed stares all around, @@HE@@ sighs. "What I mean is, we need to stop the computers when they go too fast."

2. "If you wait for a circuit breaker to trip, you're already fried!" rages firebrand investing guru @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from the TV set, where @@HIS@@ show 'Mad @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@' is currently on. "These black boxes can trade tens of thousands of times a second, and there's nothing you, or I, or @@LEADER@@ in @@CAPITAL@@ can do to slow them down! The only solution is to bring back the human touch, and require that every trade be processed by an actual person! At least they'll know a stub quote when they see it."

3. "Boo-hoo, losers are crying because they can't keep up with free market capitalism," mocks overnight millionaire @@RANDOM_NAME@@, ostentatiously flashing a wrist with half-a-dozen Rolex watches on it. "This is the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Dream, being able to win big with a little market creativity. Sure, some saps lose big too, but that's the nature of the game, folks!

*4. "This is no laughing matter" stammers the Shadow Secretary for Economics, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, with a wild look in his eyes. "Sure, things recovered this time, but next time we might not be so lucky!

We can't trust private industry not to muck it up again." [[color=red]No AI Citizenship[/color]]

*5. "The problem is not the use of computers, it is the use of the wrong computers," comes the soothing voice of Dee Sub Wun, your AI advisor.

Your niece @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@, who reached the age of majority three weeks ago and left home the day afterwards, has finally written a letter: "Hello, blood relatives. I am safe and have found my real, spiritual family. The Society of Love are wonderful people who truly care about me. I have pledged one trillion years of loyal service and all my present and future possessions to them. If you love me, let me be happy and send me my stuff. Ta and that. Bye forever, Sister Sunny Sunshine Sunbeam."

The Debate
1. "@@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@ has been brainwashed!" sobs your sister. "She's been spouting mystical gobbledegook, acting distant, even reading. Now she's gone to one of these closed communities and changed her name? These happy-clappy guitar-wielding maniacs tell naïve teenagers that they could have unending happiness and wisdom and all that bullsh... -hickey, and the wide-eyed simpletons believe it. Now she wants to give up everything, even her dreams, to be a slave forever? You must break-up every cultic group that preys on young people. Drag our children home, if necessary!"

2. "Many insecure adolescents and young adults can be drawn to apparently friendly groups that seem to possess all the answers," postulates your uncle and sociologist, @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, the author of [i]Cult Classics and Faustian Faiths[/i].

The Debate
1. "Clearly this offer gave our athletes the incentive they needed to perform that little bit better," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Sports Minister, placing the final medal table in front of you. "Four years ago we only won a handful of golds; this time we won ten times as many! Okay, there was the well-known benefit of home advantage, but without doubt this was a successful scheme with a successful outcome. It absolutely must be continued at all future Olympics."

2. "No, that will not do at all; it will drain the sports and development budget – leaving little money for other projects," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Treasury Minister, who has just counted up all @@HIS@@ spare cash only to find @@HE@@ is one @@CURRENCY@@ short for a Moonbucks. "It sickens me that our athletes only perform at their best when there's something extra in it for them. Do away with this ludicrous scheme, save ourselves some money and install some national pride into our sportsmen and women!"

3. "Not enough national pride, you say?" queries General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, as she salutes the flag in your office. "If these athletes only try hard when there's a free house and piles of cash involved, then we need to give them a different kind of incentive!

Nearly two dozen sightseers were injured yesterday in a rockfall. Their tour bus, which had been travelling through a scenic mountainous region in northern @@NAME@@, was struck by a large boulder as it tumbled down a steep slope. The accident has resulted in calls to protect roadways in areas prone to rockfalls.

The Debate
1. "I just wanted to see the sights. Instead I got slammed by clastic sedimentary rocks!" exclaims rockfall survivor and geologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, cuts and bruises visible on @@HIS@@ extremities. "After the accident, the first thing I did was get down on my hands and knees and thank my lucky stars. The next thing I did was wonder how @@NAME@@ could even allow something like this to occur! Motorists shouldn't have to worry about conglomerates crashing into them! Protective roadside barriers and fences should be erected in areas where rockfalls are common."

2. "It was a tragedy, for sure, yet another example why safety should never be taken for granite," states environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Constructing roadside barriers and fences just isn't worth it, and not only because they'd break the bank. In doing their duty, they'd also mar some of the most beautiful roadside views in @@NAME@@ and disrupt local wildlife. Of course, people's safety is important, so posting warning signs along the roadside is an appropriate measure to take.

*3. "They say it takes millions of years for mountainous regions to form," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of one of the largest mining companies in @@NAME@@. "If you allow us to perform mountaintop removal mining, rockfalls and the ugly, eroding mountains and cliffs responsible for causing them will be a thing of the past.

The Issue
After Brancaland announced an increase in tariffs on all goods imported from abroad, several other countries retaliated by doing the same thing to Brancalandian goods. They now expect a response from @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "Let's just do what everyone else is doing and increase tariffs on Brancalandian imports," suggests your Trade Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The Brancs rely heavily on us to supply them with iron, copper, and other raw materials. When they have to start paying through the nose for them, I'm sure they'll see sense and reconsider their own tariff increase."

2. "If we raise tariffs as well, that will surely increase the cost of goods for consumers!" panics @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Economic Advisor. "We need to work with the Brancalandians, not against them. So we should actually lower tariffs in an attempt to get them to buy more from us; once they see that we're giving them a fair deal, they might even lower their tariffs for us. They get to trade more goods, we get to trade more goods, and the average @@DEMONYM@@ reaps the savings. Everyone wins!"

3. "Why pay the extra tariffs?" asks General @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Hell, why pay for anything when we can just threaten Brancaland with a couple of gunboats in their harbors? The rest of the international community may not like it, but we can cut them a deal on maple syrup or something."

The Issue
At the latest round of meetings between Brancaland and @@NAME@@, the feminine graces of one of the foreign female diplomats were notable, and @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ aides were caught staring at her in every place other than her eyes.

The Debate
1. "These damn men need to lift their eyes and close their gawping mouths!" shouts @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, leader of the [i]Alliance For Empowering Women Who Agree With Me[/i]. "Our culture raises men to believe they can treat women however they want to, which is utterly not the case. The only way to fix this is legislating against objectification of women, and treating ogling eyes as sexual harassment!"

2. "Seems a little harsh, no?" interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a human resources manager at a law firm in downtown @@ANIMAL@@ City. "Our firm has an impeccable reputation for treating women correctly, and that is because we ensure all new hires go through a mandatory training policy teaching them that women are to be treated respectfully, chivalrously and politely.

*3. "It's not my fault a pretty woman decided to wear a flattering dress to the meeting," counters one of your aides accused of having a roaming gaze. "So what if I like to give women attention?

The Debate
1. "We need change!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former MP, turning @@HIS@@ pockets inside out to prove that @@HE@@ really does not have any change. "How are poor people like me ever supposed to get into office now that politicians' salaries are so miserably low? Our parliament is filled with limousine liberals and old money conservatives legislating for the benefit of their super-rich cronies. @@LEADER@@, we need to scrap this system and pay politicians at a rate slightly above professionals and private sector directors. That will end this plutocracy!"

2. "And will that end inequality?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a famous socialist thinker, pensively swinging @@HIS@@ empty champagne flute. "Politics is an expensive business. Do you know how much money you have to raise to even become a candidate? And, once you become a candidate, campaigning will cost a small fortune. This system practically precludes poor people from running for office. @@LEADER@@, if we want to achieve true equality, we should both ban people from using their own funds or private property to run for office, and fix the wages of politicians at exactly the national average wage."

3. "Hey, what is wrong with using my own money for political campaigning?" vociferates @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ tycoon who has vowed to challenge you in the upcoming elections. "It is only fair for me to use the fruits of my labor however I want. Besides, if you wouldn't bet your own funds on yourself, what's the point of collecting donations from others?

The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Resuscitation Council has noted that every year a vast number of preventable deaths occur because of lack of access to public AEDs (automated external defibrillators) and a dearth of competent first aiders able to use them.

The Debate
1. "Put an AED in every bus stop, every train station, every supermarket and next to every ATM. Make first aid training mandatory in the later school years, then make people refresh their skills every ten years," directs Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Resuscitation Council, sipping his double-cream double-shot cappuccino. "Nations with poor access to AEDs have cardiac arrest survival rates of one in twenty. In nations with good access and training, three out of four patients will live. That's got to be worth a little investment, right?"

2. "That sounds overly complex and expensive, a bit like the good doctor's premium beverage," argues dietitian @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "Personally, I like my health policies like I like my coffee: cheap and fast. Or was that how I like my men? I forget... Anyway, public health promotion is a smarter option.

1. "Just look at this!" fumes three-foot-tall disabled rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving around a poster that you can't see for the top of your desk. "This isn't a sporting event; this is a modern-day freak show. It even says they have a 'midget toss'! I know the wrestlers agreed to participate, but they aren't the only ones that have to live with the dehumanizing stereotypes. @@NAME@@ shouldn't tolerate entertainment that pokes fun at people for their size or disabilities."

2. Suddenly, a diminutive wrestler in brightly-colored spandex hurtles toward you, landing on your desk and knocking all your papers onto the floor. "Ha! What fun is life if you can't laugh at yourself?" @@HE@@ says, as @@HE@@ rolls to @@HIS@@ feet. "Maybe wrestling isn't for everyone, but it's a lot better than being unemployed or having some boring office job. We wrestlers are celebrating who we are - it's not up to you to tell us what we can't do. Instead, why don't you give us some support and let us show everyone what we can do?"

3. "You're all thinking too small," slobbers creepy endocrinologist Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leering down over the head of the wrestler and gesticulating erratically. "You've got to look at the big picture. We wouldn't have to worry about any of this if we had a cure for dwarfism, right? Well, I've just made a huge breakthrough in hormone treatments that would allow all these people to grow to a normal height, instead of being freakishly small. All I need is some funding to make my project a reality. Yes, that's all..." @@HE@@ cackles maniacally, though it's not clear what @@HE@@ is finding so funny.

[b][anchor=1140]#1140[/anchor]: Blinded by the Light [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
It is a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ tradition to light up one's home with demonstrative holiday lights during festive seasons. While this has always been a distractive issue for drivers, one rather competitive neighborhood in @@CAPITAL@@ caused quite a stir. The strobe lights and military-grade lasers used in several displays caused multiple traffic accidents and temporary blindness, prompting a national discussion on this issue and scores of lawsuits.

The Debate
1. "These lights must be banned!" demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ unintentionally smacks your interns with @@HIS@@ walking stick. "My life has been disrupted by temporary blindness because some idiot thought it was a good idea to use strobe lights! The government must step in and ban all of these eyesores before they hurt anyone else. What's so fun about staring at some lights, anyway?"

2. "Come on now, you can't be serious!" scoffs personal injury lawyer and five-time winner of [i]Best Light Display in @@CAPITAL@@[/i], @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What about the holiday spirit and our freedom of expression? You can't ban something that people have enjoyed for years just because a few people end up getting hurt! You'd be robbing @@NAME@@ of a very important holiday tradition. Besides, these injuries are great for business."

3. "Compromise, everyone!" exclaims your Minister of Compromises, who has been appearing in far too many meetings recently. "I agree that banning holiday lights is a ridiculous idea, but at the same time we can't ignore the risks to public health and safety. So how about we mandate that the manufacturers tone down the brightness in their lights and ban the sale of military grade lasers and excessively bright strobe lights to the public? That way people still get their lights and nobody risks getting blinded! It sure beats spending the holidays in a hospital."

4. "The problem isn't lights! It's drivers!" complains safety advocate and leader of the [i]Mothers Against Everything[/i] protest group, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Even during regular days we have careless drivers going way over the speed limit, putting our children's lives at risk. Cars must be banned from suburban roads! That's what will reduce accidents, not banning lights!"

The Issue
After the public poll to name @@CAPITAL@@'s newest trolley line was handily won by a tired and insincere meme response, making it the sixth consecutive poll with similar results, the mayor has come to your office begging for an official stance on naming procedures for public projects.

The Debate
1. "Trolley McTrolleyface?" sighs the mayor dejectedly. "I have to ride to work on Trolley McTrolleyface? I wanted 'The @@ANIMAL@@ Express,' but no, we're stuck with this boring nonsense again. Instead of throwing open these polls to every juvenile delinquent or obnoxious 'Grick and Morgy' fan, could we please establish some boundaries? How about a committee of respected citizens to vet the choices that are on the ballot? That way the people get their say, and we get some dignity!"

2. "Remind me again why we let the public vote on this stuff at all," interjects your Auxiliary Regional Subaltern for Naming Things. "The government foots the bill, the government has the responsibility for maintaining our nation's image, and the government should choose the name! Heck, perhaps you should just name the next project after yourself!"

3. "Are you kidding me? These names are great!" bubbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Communication Director's intern, while excitedly checking your metrics. "This isn't civic failing, it's civic engagement! If some silly names are all it takes to get citizens fired up and interested in public works, then isn't that worth it? Who cares if it's a bit repetitious – it's great for our optics! Besides, if we really are a democracy, we have to respect the people's vote."

The national debate that's followed has become impossible to ignore.

The Debate
*1. "I'll be dammed if this doesn't keep coming up every couple years," sighs a representative from the Womb Tang Clan, a leading abortion advocacy group. "Sneaking around in bathroom stalls is for politicians, not for women seeking legitimate healthcare! We need to keep abortion safe and legally accessible to all women, especially the vulnerable women who are most likely to need more than one abortion and would be most impacted by any attempt to limit or defund abortions. @@LEADER@@, we must mandate full healthcare provision of these vital, life-saving services and fund the distribution of free contraception to all women in @@NAME@@."

[[color=red]Contraceptives are illegal[/color]]

3. "Well, I never!" gasps renowned socialite Ms. Effie Beauregard-Sessile, dropping what appears to be a pair of opera glasses. "Murdering babies is healthcare now? Whatever is this world coming to? If we're going to make @@NAME@@ great again, we can't be seen funneling tax money towards fetal genocide! We need to respect innocent, unborn @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ children by making abortion illegal under any circumstance and prosecuting these witches as the murderers they are." She pulls out a folding fan and begins fanning herself with dainty flicks of her wrist.

4. "I have no objection to little ladies getting an abortion," chortles Stan Li, striding into the center of the room while tipping his Stetson to the previous two speakers. "But listen, @@LEADER@@, my... erm, our tax @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ shouldn't be spent covering all these preventable health problems. If a negligent individual has any adverse health outcome — an unintended pregnancy, diabetes, heart disease, cancer — well, that's their choice and their right! But it should also be their responsibility. The national health service should only pay if people did [i]nothing[/i] that could have possibly brought on their illness."

5. "Let's all agree that one accident can happen, right? But not learning something from that, having a second unintended pregnancy..." A cloaked figure from the back of the room steps into the light, a sneer spreading across his lips. "Well, that kind of woman cannot be trusted with the responsibility of self-management society granted her. If any woman should ever want a second abortion, the government should only fund it if she agrees to a simultaneous sterilization procedure."

The only problem is that forty years have passed since the crime.

The Debate
1. "The principle of a statute of limitations is important to due process," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a defence lawyer and civil rights expert who recently managed to get serial killer 'Psycho Pete' released on compassionate grounds. "After so many years, the case for prosecution is no longer viable. Witness accounts can no longer be considered reliable, and physical evidence will have deteriorated. Also, the suspect is now a frail, old man who has certainly committed no crime in decades. The police were clearly incompetent in their inability to bring a prosecution to bear within a reasonable timeframe. Any outcome other than dismissal of the case would be a grave injustice."

*2. "You don't stop being guilty just because time has passed," insists @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Head Warden at @@CAPITAL@@ Prison as @@HE@@ runs @@HIS@@ truncheon along the radiator in your office. "This man is a common thief and shouldn't be allowed to get away with what he did.

The Issue
Seemingly unprovoked, the renowned Lord Ota Novumaga has attacked a neighboring barony in Western @@NAME@@ with his own private army. As noble tensions increase and rumors of a civil war brew, your court and office have become a battlefield of conflicting ideals.

The Debate
1. Lord Ota Novumaga enters your court and bows in deference. "The Lord in question had plans to attack neigbouring estates, putting the safety of the entire region at risk. If you may grant me a title of knighthood, @@LEADER@@, I will pledge my sword and loyalty to protect @@NAME@@. I have faith that other aristocrats shall also answer duty's call!"

2. "Ota is a very ambitious man," sneers Lady Macbed, the wife of one of your advisors. "Be careful about giving him too much authority. Keep in mind, he acted in a reckless manner — a sorry sight indeed. Do not be so willing to offer up the milk of human kindness to that man. A different reward for his service could possibly be offered, if only a pittance to send a message. Perhaps rewarding him with only half of the land of the Lord he stopped?"

3. "The problem is the lack of a central authority," your brother suggests, casually flipping through the latest edition of 'Prince Charming Magazine'. "Now, I'm not saying you're a bad leader. It's just that the nobles don't see you as a credible one. You need a lesson in projecting confidence; crack some heads to show these aristocrats who's boss. All the nobility will have no choice but to bow down to your authority."

4. A military man struts into your office amidst a group of peasants singing a very catchy song about 'angry men'. "Leader, I am George Bonaparte, a nobleman who will speak for the people. @@NAME@@ is infested with incompetents who inherit titles rather than earn them. They feud among themselves having done little for the people they are supposed to lead! Do the right thing and abolish feudalism and the nobility, unless you want the masses who have long stayed silent to finally rise up in arms against you!"

A nature photographer on assignment in the Kawandalandian wilderness caught @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@ toying with their spare camera equipment. Either on purpose or by accident, this @@ANIMAL@@ managed to snap a selfie. Upon returning back to @@NAME@@, the impressed photographer began to sell copies of the selfie to interested buyers. As news of the so-called 'smart @@ANIMAL@@' continues to spread, animal rights activists have raised some surprising copyright concerns.

The Debate
1. "That picture is not this photographer's intellectual property because @@HE@@ did not take it," bluntly states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a philanthropist with a long record of donating to conservationist causes. "It is morally wrong that @@HE@@ profits from this work. While I will admit that the picture in question is intriguing, @@HE@@ has unfairly earned enough already. If this portrait continues to be distributed, I humbly request that all future proceeds go completely towards a good cause. My philanthropic foundation, perhaps?"

2. "This is an affront to @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ everywhere!" howls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a spokesperson for the organization [i]People for the Ethical Treatment of Everything[/i]. "There is only one individual with the right to all earnings from this photograph: the noble creature who took it!

3. "Just hand that photograph over to us," sternly orders Doctor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, director of the National Science Laboratory. "This can be an amazing PR opportunity!

"I don't know where this is going to lead us, but it won't be anything good. This selfie and 'me first' culture that's corrupting our society needs to be nipped in the bud.

The Issue
A recent report from the Bureau of Population Statistics has revealed that, during the past quarter, the number of parenting licenses given to prospective parents fell to an all-time low.

The Debate
1. Your secretary, who has failed the parenting test four times in a row, is eager to speak to you about this. "I mean, come on! How was I supposed to know how long it takes for a baby to get to the center of a lollipop? The test shouldn't be so impossibly hard that no one can pass it. And there are so many other restrictions and requirements that get in the way of people trying to be parents. I beg you to make it easier for a regular person to obtain a license. I promise I will raise my children well!"

2. "Seems like we're running a country full of idiots, doesn't it?" complains the head bureaucrat of the government agency that awards parenting licenses. "The application process is doing its job if it keeps those who are unqualified from having children. If there is one child in the hands of a parent without their wits intact, then we have failed as a nation. Instead of making the process easier, we need to be even more selective. And we should monitor the progress of parents even after they get their licenses, just to make sure they're parenting up to standard. Only the best, brightest, and most qualified deserve to raise a family."

3. "Licenses? We don't need no stinking licenses!" yowls your Minister of Productivity, writhing and jumping around you. "Less children — bad! Less productivity — bad! Bad for economy! We always need to be producing, always need to be doing! More children, more doing!" The minister's mouth froths as @@HE@@ mumbles on the floor, making bizarre thrusting motions.

The Issue
Though @@RANDOM_NAME@@ was subsequently exonerated for the many crimes that @@HE@@ was accused of, videos of the "perp walk" @@HE@@ made between the police station and the court are continuing to surface online and in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ media.

The Debate
1. "Perp walks are barbaric and needlessly cruel," states criminal justice reform and privacy advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while covering @@HIS@@ face with a paper bag. "Not to mention a total violation of privacy. Why should people endure the humiliation of that long walk with cameras flashing in their faces? What if the person is innocent? At least let them have their dignity before you lock them up in a cold, metal box."

2. "On the contrary, privacy is less important than transparency of procedure," replies a tough-on-crime police officer who would rather not be named. "The people and the free press have a right to know the creeps who are committing crimes in our great country! In fact, we ought to make perp walks more harrowing! Have the criminals walk a whole mile before they're escorted away, and let onlookers jeer and throw rotten fruit at them! That'll surely teach people that crime doesn't pay!"

3. "Obviously, we need to strike a balance between the two extremes," suggests armchair legal expert @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why not limit perp walks to only the most heinous of crimes and wait until after they're convicted? That way the media gets to have its circus, but only when we say they can."

[4]. "Are we forgetting the fact that an innocent person was humiliated?" reminds @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@'s lawyer. "My client's life was destroyed by police incompetence and cruelty.

[b][anchor=1148]#1148[/anchor]: Unfit for Purpose [Nuremgard; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The Department of Welfare has been criticized for the way it assesses potential claimants of disability benefits. The department sends out agents from private companies to force claimants to perform what critics call "cruel and humiliating" assessments in order to prove they need the benefit.

The Debate
1. "This is disgusting and inhumane," furiously shouts wheelchair-bound claimant @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "That person who came to assess me wasn't even a licensed medical professional in my area of care. @@HE_1@@ was a former optician! Does it look like my eyes aren't working? @@HE_1@@ made me roll up and down my hallway until my arms got tired, then told me I didn't need the benefit because I could roll along the floor on my own without difficulty! End this now. A note from your doctor or other relevant professional should be enough evidence to claim disability benefit. It's not as if they'd lie."

2. "The system works just fine," claims your grey-suited and stoic Welfare Minister. "We have to carefully screen every claim, otherwise every scammer and skiver would try to con the government out of money for every cut and scrape they have. Make the assessments more stringent, and properly fund my department. That way, it'll deter the con artists and only the truly disabled will receive assistance."

3. "I think a lack of empathy is the problem," suggests a random passer-by who happened to overhear the meeting. "I'm not against the principle of assessing clinical needs, but we need to make it fairer on claimants. I heard one story of one of those agents asking a suicidal person how they would kill themselves if they were to do it. We should ensure that all assessors have the same disability as the claimant, which will ensure they are treated humanely and fairly, as well as making sure that the assessor has a good understanding of what the condition entails."

4. "This is all just a waste of time and money!" exclaims self-styled Social Darwinist and anti-government crusader @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Think of the suffering taxpayers! Where are our benefits, hmm? We're the real victims here, not these lazy slackers on disability! Abolish their welfare payments and let natural selection work things out."

1. "Another happy customer!" declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the manager of a large firearm factory, beaming with pride. "Look how pleased that gentleman is at his @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE_INITIALS@@XP-7631 battle rifle's stopping power. Just as advertised, it is making mincemeat of that mother and baby! Hey, speaking of advertisement, can we use this footage please? I think videos like these are fantastic at showcasing the quality of our awesome products."

2. "Hm... perhaps too good an advertisement," says the factory's assistant manager, while watching a video of a tank rolling over a man's head. "While the rebels' choice of a Model 5 @@ANIMAL@@ tank was an excellent one, maybe we should have our name... well, you know, not written onto the vehicle's hull that boldly. We should have a regulation to scrape off our weapons' origins when selling them abroad. That way, only gun nuts will know about our role in these... um... occurrences."

3. "Oh come on, you idiot!" screams infuriated weapons designer Koch Winchester at the screen. "Do you want to get blood jamming your pristine shotgun? Because beating an old woman to death with one is how you get that! Guns are for shooting, not... ugh. Hey, @@LEADER@@, it's clear that these foreigners don't know how to use our goods properly. You should ban all sales abroad and only sell our weapons to the fine people of @@NAME@@. Be sure to loosen up those gun laws first!"

4. "That's ridiculous!" cries the Bigtopian ambassador. "If anything, these atrocities are proof that our great country needs more aid in crushing these rebel scum. You should mandate that only legitimate governments can purchase your arms. [i]We[/i] certainly don't get involved in such gratuitous violence in more than 30% of the towns we liberate. That way, you will instead see your nation's name being used for good, not this disgusting stuff. Mostly."

5. "Wait just a minute!" shouts @@RANDOMAME@@, your Minister of Non-Violent Solutions, who appears to have just smashed @@HIS@@ way out of a storage room after being locked inside by your Defense Minister. "Why do we even have a weapons industry? Look at the destruction it's causing. This world would be a better place without our weapons and the accompanying bloodshed.

"You understand, don't you? We trade with you, and we look like we're endorsing your actions. Of course, if you considered abolishing these medieval practices, then I'm sure we could set this matter aside and even encourage our allies to trade with you."

2. "Ouch, sly - that's an ultimatum," your aide whispers, as the Skandilunder leaves. "If they're too soft and touchy to be associated with us, then we should forget about them. Maybe we push for trading more with morally flexible nations like Maxtopia? At least they're not snobs, like these preachy liberal forest hippies."

3. "We could just pretend to end and renounce torture!" exclaims your Minister of Creatively Augmented Interrogations. "All we need to do is hide our activities in an island detention camp somewhere off the coast, torture and interrogate prisoners for answers, and make sure to kill them when we're done with them!

When the Holy Month of Golden Bloom rolls around, members of the Tranquillity of Yellow observe fasting: neither eating nor drinking anything from dawn till dusk. @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, your Minister of Labor, has reasoned that fasting leads to a loss of productivity and potentially endangers lives.

The Debate
1. "I mean, it's a no-brainer, isn't it?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, still chewing the big bite @@HE@@ took of @@HIS@@ mouth-watering chocolate lava cake. "These people fast for an entire day, and everyone knows that prolonged hunger and dehydration can cause concentration problems. What if a Yellowite surgeon operated on a patient while fasting and made a mistake? Human lives come before religious duties. Hence, all Tranquil Yellowites should be banned from fasting if they want to keep their jobs."

2. "How dare you meddle with my freedom of religion!" gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Yellowite preacher, flourishing a staff topped with an ornamental sunflower at the Labor Minister, while casting a yearning glance at @@HIS@@ cake. "I have practised fasting since I was a child, and I can assure you that it doesn't compos- compres- I mean compromise our cognitive abilities. Also, daytime fasting isn't actually unhealthy you know - there's growing evidence that it reduces a number of ailments and could even prevent cancers. It would be both spiritually and physically good if you told all @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ to join the Fast of the Holy Month of Golden Bloom."

3. "Let's not be hasty; I'm sure there is room for a sweet compromise here," chimes in @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Creative Solutions. "I agree that suffering from thirst and hunger for a whole day can cause problems in the workplace. But instead of banning our Yellowite citizens from fulfilling their religious duties, we could give them paid leave during the Holy Month of Golden Bloom, so they could safely fast in the comfort of their homes. To safeguard equality, we can make similar accommodations for all faiths: extra vacations for pilgrimages and regular prayer breaks at work."

[4]. "This whole fasting thing is sacrilege!" exclaims Papa Luigi, a well-known pizzeria owner and a member of the Cult of Pizza, flailing his arms dramatically.

2. "Ahh, so a few young whippersnappers got a bit too lively," comments @@CAPITAL@@'s gruff and aging police chief. "What's needed isn't trying to stop folks from learning how to fight, because they'll always be doing that whether they call it Kung-Fu or Kung Pao or just plain old brawling.

3. "If this humble one, whose name is Master Po, might be heard?" suggests a passer-by with a long white beard that touches the ground, speaking to a broadcasting reporter. "The true problem is not that so many people are learning these arts, grasshopper. It is that unfortunately too many of their teachers have been focusing solely on the arts' physical aspects without also instructing their pupils in the underlying philosophical principles that would lead those people away from welcoming violent confrontation. I suggest making the teachings of the Seven Sages of Old a core part of this country's education system - not just for those who would then learn to fight, but for everybody who would learn anything. This is the wisest answer available."

The Debate
1. "@@ANIMAL@@ Pharmaceuticals was both dealing diphenhydramine and defiling human rights," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ ambassador to Kawandaland.

More and more @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ film studios are turning to Brancaland due to the generous tax credits of the picturesque coastal city Maxhoover. Industry representatives and local patriots alike have prompted calls for action.

The Debate
1. "CUT!" shouts controversial film director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, known for @@HIS@@ unapologetic patriotism and xenophobia, who is coincidentally filming a scene in your office. "@@LEADER@@, if I may be frank, why don't we punish these unpatriotic hacks? They show a complete lack of respect for our culture and take jobs away from hardworking citizens. Can't you put these people on some sort of watchlist and create some sort of committee to assess their loyalty to @@NAME@@?"

2. "What is it about these debates that always attracts crazy extremists?" sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the mayor of a lakefront city in @@NAME@@. "As much as I'd love for my city to be the face of the film industry, how can we blame these studios for going over to Brancaland? They offer generous tax credits, their people are friendly, and their environment is ranked as one of the best in the world. What we should be doing is offering tax credits of our own to encourage film crews to shoot movies and shows right here at home. Oh, and would it kill you to help us clean up the city? The streets and parks are littered with trash!"

3. "There's no need to get your unmentionables in a twist aboot this," suggests eccentric Brancalandian talent agent Mike Shatner with long pauses between his words. "I'll have you know that actors are one of Brancaland's primary exports. In return we offer tax credits and the best studios that money can buy. Unless you want to risk damaging your country's relationship with Brancaland and deny your people some quality acting, like the award-winning [i]Spit @@LEADER@@ Says[/i], I suggest you make it easier for studios to choose Brancaland over @@NAME@@. By the way, was that a great impression of you, or what?"

4. "I would like to suggest that we advertise @@NAME@@ to a classier audience," remarks snooty independent film director @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while sipping on a glass of Brancalandian Red. "You don't want the riffraff making @@NAME@@ look like a bunch of uncultured hicks with explosions and gore-fests, do you? With generous investments in the industry, we can attract the right audiences and weed out the boorish undesirables. You could even host yearly film festivals in @@CAPITAL@@ to encourage more people to film in our exquisite city!"

[b][anchor=1155]#1155[/anchor]: The Banquet of Walnuts [Verdant Haven; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
A massive church scandal has begun unfolding internally after a number of religious leaders and other supposedly holy individuals were found to have participated in an evening of debauchery and licentiousness, the specifics of which are in strict conflict with many core teachings of the faith. Featuring illicit companionship, suggestive dancing, and candied walnuts scattered about the floor for use in shockingly immoral ways, the salacious details of this banquet will surely shake your people's faith to its core.

The Debate
1. "We must make examples of these reprobates!" roars @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Ministries, from the portable pulpit that @@HE@@ is always being wheeled around in by @@HIS@@ assistants. "Our faith must show no tolerance for those who deviate from the true path. The perpetrators must be cast out from our nation and into the fires of anywhere but here! They are sick, twisted, and didn't invite me!"

2. "The people won't lose their trust if we make sure they don't hear about this in the first place," murmurs a shady-looking individual slowly rolling a pair of walnuts in his hand. "We just need to hush up what happened, and quietly have the offenders moved to other dioceses so this doesn't happen again... at least not with the same witnesses. If anybody comes forward publicly, we'll accuse them of fabricating it all!"

3. "Is it really so bad?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the official who happens to own the house where the party occurred. "I mean honestly, if the higher power is synonymous with love, what could be more divine than sharing one's love with a few dozen strangers? @@NAME@@ should embrace our activities and teach the populace that all love is good love!"

[4]. "Honestly, the state shouldn't entangle itself with the private activities of the church, just as the church should stay out of matters of government," flatly states the nearly forgotten Minister of Secular Affairs. "Besides, if our religious leadership can't follow our religion, how can we trust them to guide our country? Perhaps it's time to give secular leaders back their power... say, why are you grabbing that pitchfork?" [[color=purple]Must have Low Religiousness?[/color] TBD.]

The Issue
A video recently made the rounds on crowdfunding websites, showing a disease-ridden elderly @@ANIMAL@@, clearly in great distress. This was accompanied by a commentary from the owner, pleading for donations to help pay for the medical treatment that @@HE_1@@ couldn't afford.

The Debate
1. "Animals can suffer just as much as humans can," explains @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, the pet owner in question, hoping that it was clear this was an observation rather than a suggestion. "Happily, crowdfunding paid for poor Lucky's treatment, even though he didn't make it. For the future though, I think there should be a National Veterinary Service to provide health care for all domesticated animals."

2. "Oh come on, they're just things! They don't have feelings!" laughs teenager @@RANDOM_NAME@@ whilst pulling the wings off a fly. "Their health is their owner's cost to cover. If this idiot couldn't afford to look after @@HIS_1@@ @@ANIMAL@@, @@HE_1@@ should have let it die, or just disposed of it."

[3]. "We can be balanced about this, and provide something for animals while boosting the economy," offers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of fast food chain [i]BurgerThis[/i]. "My company will offer free euthanasia to any sick animals brought to our slaughterhouses, so long as we can keep the remains. You just need to loosen a few bureaucratic regulations, and the problem will be gone." [[color=blue]Must not be vegetarian[/color]]

[b][anchor=1157]#1157[/anchor]: Rodney and Julietta [The Free Joy State; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The unlikely romance between your nephew Rodney and Princess Julietta, the second daughter of the King of Moltevino, has been the talk of @@REGION@@ for many months. However, it hit a snag when the young couple decided to make a long-term commitment. Moltevino refuses to sanction such a match, as your nephew is not of royal blood.

The Debate
1. "The King of Moltevino extends his noble hand in friendship," declares Moltevino's ambassador Lord Capello between tightly clenched lips, half-bowing. "Our fair kingdom has been enriched by exports of our many grape-based products and would like to share that glory through a favorable trade agreement. The King has one small request in return: lock your threadbare juggler of a nephew away from the Pearl of Moltevino, burn all his mad-headed ravings of love, and keep that rancorous coxcomb confined until he has foresworn all ties that he claims existed between himself and the Princess. Her Radiance isn't a hedge-born puterelle who should be consorting with commoners! No offence intended."

*2. "Pathetic little Moltevino is trying to push us around?" scoffs the Minister of Ego-Boosting. "You could spit from one side of their country and hit the other side! Their only notable export is wine. Granted, it's damn good wine, but we still have Marche Noire. Let good old Princess Jules come and live in @@NAME@@. What are the Moltevinans gonna do? Invade us to get their 'Pearl' back? With what — their army of three pensioners, two cowards, and one courageous golden retriever named 'Cuddles'? I'd like to see them try!" [[color=blue]Alcohol is legal[/color]]

*3. "Pathetic little Moltevino is trying to push us around?" scoffs the Minister of Ego-Boosting and Teetotalism. "You could spit from one side of their country and hit the other side! Their only notable export is wine. I mean, it's damn good wine... I've heard. But we don't want that stuff in our dry country anyway! Let good old Princess Jules come and live in @@NAME@@. What are the Moltevinans gonna do? Invade us to get their 'Pearl' back? With what — their army of three pensioners, two cowards, and one courageous golden retriever named 'Cuddles'? I'd like to see them try!" [[color=red]Alcohol is illegal[/color]]

4. "Fair Moltevino has so much more than wine," exhorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Minister of Culture, as @@HE@@ holds up a brochure. "Look at this: meandering river cruises through wine country, historic architecture, Lovers' Clock in the [i]piazza vecchia[/i]. Perhaps an influx of tourist cash might be the tie that binds this lovers' knot, through a story that shouldn't be forgot. The young couple could settle in their preferred nation, and in return we would help promote Moltevino as a major tourist destination. Lots of sightseers visiting romantic places can put a smile on even the grumpiest of kings' faces. For never was a story marketed better, than that of Rodney and his Julietta."

5. "Oh, just become a monarch," shrugs your laziest nephew, @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, who's just been fired after one day at his latest in a long line of jobs. "Come on, you waving to the people from balconies, talking about 'royal unions between two nations, both alike in dignity'... folks'd love it! Then Rodney would be 'His Royal Highness Rodney of @@NAME@@' and I'd never have to work again... I mean, and he could be with the Princess. Wouldn't that be cool?"

[b][anchor=1158]#1158[/anchor]: Flying Into a Rage [Australian rePublic; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Two passengers were both accused of going on drunken rampages on two different flights. When they each faced the same judge on the same day, one was sentenced to two years in prison while the other was issued a small fine and a stern warning. The only apparent difference between the two is that the first was a man, and the second was a woman.

The Debate
1. "This is sky-high sexism," complains @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, brother to the convicted man. "Both people here pleaded guilty to and committed the same crime, but were treated totally differently! The system is discriminatory against men, and must be changed! Sentences should be based on the crime, not the perpetrator's gender!"

2. "This man is being ludicrous," counters Judge @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "When sentencing, we look at a wide range of factors. These include assessment of statistical likelihood of repeat offence, and the aggression of the individual. The law is not black and white, and I judged that this 120-kilo skinhead male was more likely to reoffend than the mild-mannered and charming young lady in the sensible suit. Judicial discretion is essential in sentencing, and must be respected."

3. "Why dost thou think it so ill if a maiden receiveth a more lenient sentence than a knave?" questions armourclad medieval re-enactor @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, as he hands out pamphlets about the benefits of chivalry. "Menfolk are more capable of tolerating prison than the weaker flowers of femininity, and our poor ladyfolk art needed back at the hearth to tend to the children, and to their womanly duties! Spare the weaker sex the indignity of gaol, I beseech thee!"

The Issue
Some @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are circumventing the ban on adultery by marrying anyone they'd like an affair with. Once the excitement of the relationship is over, the lovers will often then have nothing further to do with each other.

The Debate
*1. "These morally deficient sex addicts are making a mockery of the sanctity of marriage," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hand-in-hand with his two wives. "A marriage is supposed to be a sacred bond of trust between two, or more, people for life. You should make these legal adulterers pay by having them live with their partners until the day they die – no divorce, no separation, nothing! If they don't comply, they should be charged with adultery and receive the full punishment!" [[color=blue]Divorce is legal[/color]]

*2. "These morally deficient sex addicts are making a mockery of the sanctity of marriage," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hand-in-hand with his two wives. "A marriage means you're supposed to support your lovers for life. You should make these legal adulterers pay by having them live with their partners until the day they die – no separation, no vacations away from one another, nothing! If they don't comply, they should be charged with adultery and receive the full punishment!" [[color=red]Divorce is illegal[/color]]

3. "This was bound to happen," cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a leading monogamy advocate and author of the controversial book [i]I Do, Not We Do[/i]. "Having multiple spouses is just cheating on your one true love. Make everyone choose one spouse, and only one spouse. That's the way to true peace and marital harmony."

4. "Consent is the word to remember," blurts out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your cousin's first and least favourite spouse. "You know why? Because if someone feels the need for a bit — ahem — extra, they should have the full consent from every spouse involved. Legally documented and informed consent will put to bed the troublesome issue of illegal extramarital affairs."

The Issue
@@DEMONYMADJETIVE@@ consumers have seen the prices of dairy products continue to skyrocket, seemingly without reason. However, a recent exposé by an investigative journalist has finally shed light on this situation: the three largest dairy producers in @@NAME@@ have conspired to fix prices.

The Debate
1. "Shame! Shame! Down with the cartels!" chants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an angry protestor, ringing a cow bell in sync with @@HIS@@ slogans. "We've had to pay exorbitant prices for basic dairy foodstuffs, all because a bunch of industry fat cats decided they wanted to rip us off! You should immediately implement strict antitrust laws across all industries to prevent such collusions, and make these price-fixers pay a sizeable deterrent fine."

2. "What? Holy cow! We were just trying to, uh, help our farmers!" exclaims Curd Holstein, CEO of [i]MooMoo Pure Dairy[/i]. "Supermarket price wars were driving milk rates so low that dairy farmers were running at a loss, and struggling to make ends meet. Our noble goal was to improve their lot by increasing the prices, but nobody appreciates us! You should support and congratulate us, @@LEADER@@, as well as provide subsidies to the dairy industry."

3. "It's a shame that we have to pay for basic commodities like this," muses embittered socialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Look, imagine you have two cows and... no, wait, that doesn't work. What I mean to say is that the government should pay producers a fixed tariff, and then supply a milk ration directly to the people. That will prevent greedy businesspeople from endangering people's health for profit, and ensure that nobody will go to bed hungry!"

The Issue
An anonymous whistleblower leaked evidence that despite banning political parties, powerful and secret blocs of politicians have begun unofficially helping each other pass and defeat legislation, effectively rendering the ban pointless.

The Debate
1. "I cannot believe the nerve of these people!" fumes independent MP @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while making threatening gestures at @@HIS@@ rivals in the room. "Here we are, trying to run a government free of partisan politics, and instead we have what's effectively a party trying to undermine the system! Everyone involved in these blocs must be expelled from office before they take over the government!"

2. "I'm shocked, shocked!" sarcastically replies a former Opposition backbencher while making a tally of the MPs surrounding you. "Of course, we wouldn't have this problem if we had political parties. What you should do is reinstate national parties, and install some sort of... oh, let's say 'quota' for each one. That way, people with opposing viewpoints will be fairly represented, and no one would be more powerful than anyone else."

3. "No way! This has been the greatest idea you've ever had!" exclaims independent MP and professional suck-up @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The fact that people elected us like-minded officials should tell you what they really want - and what they want is for us to implement your agenda. So why not cut out the middleman and henceforth ban all elections in Socialist Democratic Communes? Blackacre manages well enough without them. That way, you can impose your agenda without any opposition getting in the way!"

The Issue
Your Minister for Anti-Homosexuality, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, was recently arrested for sleeping with a transwoman who possessed male genitals. Homosexuality is illegal in @@NAME@@, but many around you are unsure if his actions count as breaking the law. In chains and on his knees, the fallen minister waits for you to decide his fate.

The Debate
1. "Oh @@LEADER@@, thank you for allowing me this audience!" cries the relieved Willy. "You know that I fully support the homosexuality ban. I am straight, and I'm not at all attracted to men. My lover is not a man. She's a woman, and what I was doing with her was completely legal. She just so happens to still have a penis, that's all. Please, release both of us and I'll work hard to take down all the hidden homosexuals in this nation."

*2. "Either way, he is still a deviant pervert," contends the bearded Acting Minister for Anti-Homosexuality. "We must clarify that our laws cover this sort of abhorrent behavior; a penis is not a technicality! Although I'm sure our friend here has been enjoying his time in chains, I say we make an example out of this debauchee and hang both him and his plaything."

4. "Just because a person is trapped in the body of the opposite sex, doesn't mean they should automatically be perceived as gay," asserts the limp-wristed Sub-Minister for Anti-Homosexuality. "They're actually attracted to their opposite sex; they just happen to be that sex at the same time... involuntarily. It can be confusing, I'll grant you that. To avoid further muddle, I propose the government provide funds for all transsexual individuals to undergo mandatory sex reassignment surgery."

5. "Or..." shouts your resident poet @@RANDOM_NAME@@, followed by an overly long pause for dramatic effect. "You step out of the shadowlands, shift course and sail the ship of @@NAME@@ on great winds bearing perfume and warmth, towards a shore where love is love and to love is never a crime." Looking at the blank faces of your ministers, he sighs and turns to you. "You know, just legalize it, man."

The Issue
After an ill-advised demonstration during a floor speech on chemical safety standards, the national legislative building is in need of extensive renovations. Leading architects, lawmakers and political scientists have arranged a meeting with you to discuss designs for the new assembly chamber.

The Debate
1. "We should look to the Parliament of Brancaland for inspiration," pants opposition leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, taking a break from shouting into @@HIS@@ phone. "Two sets of benches: one for my Opposition and allies, the other for the current Government and their accomplices. From just over two sword lengths apart within the Clerkship's square should we look our enemies — ahem — colleagues in the eye and have a straightforward debate about the issues facing @@NAME@@. Besides, I like right angles. If only my colleagues on the other side shared the same appreciation..."

2. "The Brancalandian legislature is infamous for running into gridlock," warns senior legislator @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I surmise that a traditional semicircle would be best. Tried and true by many classical governments throughout the ages, it shall add an air of gravitas to all proceedings. With an emphasis on non-fixed seating placing parliament members of different backgrounds next to one another, you'll find the opposition less concerned with putting up a visible fight and better focused on finding ways to get the actual work of governing done."

3. "There's no time for half-measures!" declares wide-eyed celebrity architect @@RANDOM_NAME@@, laying out a rather large floor plan on your desk. "I have plans to install a grand circular skylight above the assembly while expanding the visitor gallery to three full floors. Underneath it all, there'd be no seats, only an unbridled tide of legislators flowing over concentric circles of colour. What better way to illustrate the complexity and beauty of politics unbound?"

4. "What a waste of taxpayer money," grumbles your mustachioed adviser Don Duckson, whittling down a block of wood. "Don't humor these petulant children; just have podiums at the front for the leadership with rows of solid oak desks for everyone else. It's simple and efficient. I don't see what else we have to discuss here."

A vast and seemingly endless new cave system has just been discovered in a remote section of Violetstone National Park! Despite not even having a name yet, petitioners are crowding your office telling you what to do with it.

The Debate
1. "I'm ready. Let's do this!" shouts renowned adrenaline junkie, Weevil Knievel, waving a headlamp at you. "I am going to be the first person to ever explore this cave. It would be yet another feather in the cap of my already stellar career! Yes, I know it's a nine day off-road trek into sensitive ecosystems. Yes, I know it will be fraught with danger and intrigue.

2. "You can't be serious?" chastises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of the advocacy group 'No Safety, Know Pain'. "Who knows what kind of beasts and perils might be lurking in there? Imagine this @@LEADER@@: a good, wholesome @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ family, out having a picnic in the splendor of Violetstone National Park.

A major national newspaper is taking heat after one of its crossword puzzles contained the answer 'BIGWIGS', which is considered a racial slur by Bigtopians. This is not the first time the paper has come under fire for its puzzling word choices, and concerned citizens are squaring off outside your door in hopes of filling in the blanks for you.

The Debate
1. "Get a clue, @@LEADER@@!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Civil Liberties Alliance, as @@HE@@ snaps one of your pencils in half. "It is well known throughout @@REGION@@ that the B-word is a degrading term referring to members of our nation's Bigtopian community. There is only one solution: demand that the paper fire those who permitted this puzzle to go to print. That should send a warning to everyone that such disrespect and callousness will never be tolerated!"

2. "What's a five-letter word that means 'iciness'?" inquires Bill Pantz, crossword editor for the newspaper in question, glancing up from a recent puzzle submission he is proofreading. "Oh, that's right, 'CHILL!' Look, the word 'bigwigs' simply refers to elitist fat cats, as was clued in the puzzle.

We should look to promote greater diversity in the workplace, which means instituting government-mandated sensitivity training, financial incentives for companies who hire from certain target groups, and increased funding for programs that seek the advancement of underrepresented communities.

Upon the planned completion of their vacation estate in northern @@NAME@@, a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ billionaire has additionally, and unexpectedly, purchased the vast bulk of a large forest adjacent to their property for the sole purpose of stocking and hunting @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@.

The Debate
1. "Nobody should have a right to that much land!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the mayor of @@ANIMAL@@ Grove. "That forest has sustained this town for years! Tradespeople responsibly take lumber, families near and far hike the trails, and there's a thriving birdwatching industry. All these people depend on the land and this charlatan just suddenly squats on it! What a waste. Not only should this particular forest be returned to us, @@NAME@@ needs to conduct a thorough review of these land holdings and reverse this practice of theft once and for all." 

2. "What poppycock! I have grand plans for this forest!" exclaims the shocked billionaire who can be seen wearing a wide-brimmed sunhat. "I'm planning on fashioning my own private hunting forest. There are some remarkably rare animals here that would look simply lovely on my wall. That said, while I may be inclined to hunt, our country's finer citizens might wish to augment their holdings instead. Only the wealthiest have the presence of mind to academically appreciate the gifts of Mother Nature.

3. "What incredible selfishness!" protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a conservationist. "Who do these people think they are? It's neither the town nor the rich snob's forest! Nobody should own it!

The Issue
A devastating earthquake occurred near the eastern border of @@NAME@@ last night, taking down a large section of the border wall in the process. To the surprise of the construction workers who showed up this morning, the area was filled by a group of masked people protesting against the rebuilding effort.

The Debate
1. "There's no reason why this should stop the repair work, no reason at all!" exclaims Minister of Barriers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pushing aside a protestor to make a start on boarding up the hole. "First round up all these troublesome demonstrators and arrest them. Then make this restoration our top priority, we need to make this wall even bigger and better than before – build it at least ten feet higher in the area where it fell."

2. "The wall was a bad idea in the first place," asserts one of the masked protestors. "Why do we need such a draconian immigration policy anyway? There are people fleeing wars and persecution who only wish to come here to live life in peace. @@LEADER@@, use this opportunity not to build a wall, but to embrace a new era of openness for @@NAME@@."

3. "Perhaps we could ease up on the immigration law just a bit?" advocates Zeke Fox, a long-time advisor who has a knack of creating compromises. "Instead of 'wall' or 'no wall', why don't we turn this newly acquired gap into an official border crossing? Then any foreigner who wishes to come to our great @@TYPE@@ can go through the proper channels – controlled immigration: no riff-raff, just the cream of the crop. It will also make vacations to our eastern neighbors easier, I hear they have a great water festival this time of the year."

4. "How about we address the real problem? The wall wasn't structurally sound!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Immigration Minister. "How can we ever claim to keep our border secure if a measly earthquake can just knock it down? It's time we fund a massive renovation of the entire wall – to ensure that it can stand against any act of nature. While we're at it, this wall could do with a few sentry turrets, a barbed-wire top, and landmines, lots of landmines!"

"I believe that children are our future. We teach them well, and let them show the way, as minefield scouts and pre-teen soldiers. If contraceptives are brought in, we'll be losing real manpower.

The Issue
Last week, rowdy schoolchildren toppled and broke a priceless ancient Maxtopian statue in the National Museum, then took selfies with the statue's cracked head. Now, many curators across @@NAME@@ are demanding that anyone under the age of 13 be banned from museums.

The Debate
1. "Why do parents want to bring their kids to our museums?" weeps curator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, mournfully cradling the head of the decapitated statue. "Inevitably, the little hooligans run around yelling and touching everything. What's more, having children about inevitably results in museums being dumbed-down, with shiny interactive displays and silly flashing lights. One museum I went to had a ball pit in the basement! A ball pit! Young children should be excluded, and we should be refocusing museums on preserving and celebrating our culture and history."

2. "Oh, get off your high horse," retorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, mother of three self-proclaimed 'dinosaur hunters' who are currently jumping up and down on your desk. "It's unconscionable that we are even debating shutting the museum door on kids. Denying children entry will only hurt @@NAME@@ in the long run. In fact, all children should have free entry guaranteed, and museums must be made to be more kid-friendly!"

3. "I, like, can't see why museums are even still a thing," complains teenager @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ @@ANIMAL@@, in a bland monotone. "Just last week my school, like, made my class go on a field trip to a museum or something. It was like the most boring thing ever. We were there for so long that I was beginning to fossilize, and only thing I liked was walking out the front door. You should just, like, tear down all museums. Soooooo boring."

As of late, you've noticed a higher concentration of scruffy-looking protesters than usual picketing outside your office. After asking around for the reason, your Education Minister finally informs you that the nation's PhD students have been on strike for the past six months.

1. "Finally feeling the pain of 'The Great Graduate Student Strike'?" gloats PhD candidate @@RANDOM_NAME@@, helping @@HIM@@self to a drink from your liquor cabinet. "We're dedicating our lives to improving science and the arts, all for the greater good of @@NAME@@. And what do we get in return? Long hours and stress counseling while we're all probably heavily in debt! Universities can't go on without graduate students, so throw us a line for once! Divert education funding towards the salaries of all graduate TAs and researchers while eliminating our financial burdens! Without this deal, rest assured it's back to the picket line for us!" 

2. "I don't see what the problem is," notes @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@, perusing your liquor cabinet for the most expensive selection. "Don't listen to that pretty homely dork. The free market always sorts these things out: wherever there's a true industrial need, researchers' salaries will become competitive. And quite personally, I don't see any need around here.

A highly publicized data leak from Maxtopia has revealed classified military projects studying ESP, astral projection, mind-reading and other psychic-related phenomena.

The Debate
1. "Just look at the things Maxtopia was experimenting with!" exclaims General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ fiddling with a tinfoil 'projection' cap. "There's mind-reading devices, brain-expansion exercises, this 'Dream Twister' secret project, and so much more! I mean, just imagine the potential strategic advantages on the battlefield, or in intelligence operations! Even if it comes to nothing, can you risk letting them get ahead of us? We should also be funding open-minded research into the paranormal, just to see what we find."

2. "Research alone is not taking this far enough!" proclaims purportedly psychokinetic guru @@RANDOM_NAME@@, offering you a copy of @@HIS@@ self-help book [i]Moving Forward[/i]. "The full potential of the human mind is an infinite power beyond this puny material world! A psychic soldier could stop their enemy's heart with a thought, and smash tanks with a wave of the hand. Set aside all conventional arms, and train your army to fight purely with psychic force."

3. "Oh please, don't tell me you've fallen for this nonsense as well!" moans famed debunker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "All these projects amounted to nothing: nada, zilch, zero! They have only ever produced wasted time and wasted money. It's time that we clamped down on ridiculous superstitions, and purged all magical thinking from our military! Any soldier caught spouting mystical mumbo-jumbo should be dishonorably discharged immediately!"

4. "Of course the paranormal isn't real, but that doesn't mean we can't spread some disinformation," murmurs Propaganda Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Essentially, this is about PSYOPS, not psychic ops. You must first fake and then leak data claiming that we have already developed paranormal military capabilities. This will unnerve credulous nation states, while also wasting the espionage resources of more cautious foes as they seek to refute our claims.

After a tip-off from a local informant, a SWAT team raided @@ANIMAL@@ Hill Middle School. Their targets were the students publishing the school newspaper, with the schoolchildren taken into police custody for breaking the state's official news monopoly.

The Debate
1. "What is wrong with a bunch of 11-year-olds publishing a newspaper about the events happening in their school?" exclaims furious mother @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, brandishing a rolled-up copy of the latest issue of @@ANIMAL@@ Hill Weekly. "Without school newspapers, how are we supposed to find out when my little @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME's next soccer match is going to take place or how @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@'s mom is flirting with the math teacher to raise her child's grades?

2. "Whoa, are you out of your mind?" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Truth, grabbing the newspaper from the angry parent's hand and tossing it into the portable incinerator he drags around for this specific purpose. "How can we prevent the dissemination of fake news if we allow private media to exist? We should clamp down on all audacious attempts to mislead public opinion by contradicting state-approved news!"

3. "Hail thee, our most wise and glorious @@LEADER@@!" shouts out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a political commentator from the state-owned @@CAPITAL@@ Chronicles, who used to work for a dissident newspaper before it was shut down. "I would not doubt the wisdom of your decree, but why only periodicals of non-political content? Why should only people employed by the State be granted the privilege to sing your praises?

You should allow private media sources to publish political news as well, like the true leader you are."

4. "Well... we could just allow these kids to publish their newspaper but also ensure that they don't get up to any mischief," chimes in your Minister of Alternative Solutions, peeking and whispering through from the other side of your office door's keyhole.

1. "This is a disgrace!" exclaims Harold Hastings, a linguist from @@CAPITAL@@ University, slamming the latest edition of the Maxford @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Dictionary on your desk. "These nasty Galliennais words — full of nasal sounds — have started to invade our glorious language.

2. "Oh mon dieu, but this approach will not work, as it doesn't target the raison d'être for Galliennais loan-words," enunciates William Norman, an enthusiastic Galliennais Literature professor from Cambarry University, with visible ennui. "The Galliennais culture is superior to ours, and so is their langue, par conséquent we need Galliennais words to express high-brow concepts such as rapprochement, savoir-faire, and je ne sais quoi.

Seven days of divine celebration climax on the last day, when young men and boys self-flagellate in the streets in order to prove their devotion to their god. This display is always a bloody spectacle, and sometimes participants end up in hospital.

The Debate
1. "This is a horrid exhibition," declares @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a young mother who had to dodge the self-flagellants as she brought her kids home from school. "How can this primitive horror show be permitted in our civilized society? At the end of the day, there's so much blood in the street that it looks like a battlefield.

"Foreign news agencies that aren't friendly towards us always claim that the blood comes from @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ police brutality. Be that as it may, we can't give them fuel to add to their fire.

3. "If eternal damnation is what you seek, @@LEADER@@, then go ahead and ban it," smugly declares Sebastian Sienna, a Yellowite priest, as his nurse tends to his many wounds. "The week of Holy Yellow has been observed for a thousand years, and the act of scourging ourselves en masse is the pinnacle of the week!

The Issue
Due to the recent popularity of [i]Beards of Fishermen[/i] Magazine, @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ have decided to buy their own offshore fishing boats in droves. Based on the number of fishing permit applications, the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Fish and Game Department has suggested that dividing a reasonable quota equally between requesting boats would mean each would be allowed to catch no more than seventeen fish each year.

The Debate
1. "The problem is capitalism," opines noted socialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who also blamed a recent stubbed toe on capitalism. "The state must take over the fishing industry entirely. Then the optimal fleet size and optimal fish catch for each boat can be determined by the state yearly according to the fish populations. It would also mean we'd spend less on quota enforcement because any boat which wasn't state-owned would be clearly illegal."

2. "The problem is government interventionism," states noted libertarian @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who also blamed a recent hangnail on the government. "Let's end this socialism of the sea! The government must sell its ownership of offshore waters to private entities. It will then be the property owners' responsibility to determine who fishes, how much, and how enforcement is done. Don't worry about sustainability; it will be in the property owners' interest to make sure fishing continues in the long term."

3. "No, the problem here is these extreme positions," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, author of recent bestseller [i]Fishanomics[/i]. "You just need to auction off a limited number of permits for a share of the total fish catch each year. The invisible hand of government-regulated capitalism will assure the optimal number of boats run only by the most efficient crew will do the fishing at the perfect permit price."

4. "I have ah simplah solution than all that," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an eccentric, salt of the sea boat repairer. "The problem is that modern technology has made commercial fishin' as easy as, well, shootin' fish in ah barrel. Get rid of the quota system and instead force all fishin' to be done with old fashioned methods, and sail boats, and folk wisdom. Those hipstah fishahmen won't catch a thing and enforcement will be much cheapah than it evah was for any quota system."

You ought to invest a bit, fix the roads, use business subsidies to attract the biggest international industries. In the meantime, can you direct me to the nearest port? I'm going to try my luck in Brancaland."

2. "The real problem isn't our relative poverty," explains your affronted Minister of Immigration. "It's just that people don't get what else we have to offer. You know why we have our borders open to those in need? Because we are a compassionate society — one that struggles to put food on the table, sure, but that's a side effect of our moral priorities. I recommend we offer any refugees a welfare package and charitable aid for the journey. It'll mean digging deeper in our own pockets, but we're happy to go without if it shows the world that we care."

3. "So refugees don't want to come to our country?" asks Social Nationalist campaigner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, grinning broadly. "Fantastic! If the way things are keeps foreigners out, then let's make a point of keeping it that way. Put in measures to keep supermarket shelves understocked, and sabotage economic growth any way you can. We'll stay poor, but at least we'll stay pure."

The Issue
You have come to your office this morning to find that your tea hasn't been brewed, your meeting schedule hasn't been laid out, and your plants haven't been watered. There has been a delay in everything as your assistant, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_1@@, has been slacking off work today because it is her 'time of the month.'

The Debate
1. "I can't take it any more @@LEADER@@!" wails @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_1@@, plumping down on your chair in her pajamas — then taking a sip from her chamomile tea and rubbing her belly. "For some women like me, periods are too bloody painful to concentrate on work. All female employees should have a right to paid menstrual leave for up to five days every month. Period. This way, instead of writhing in pain in our workplaces with little to no productivity, we can go shop — err, I mean, take a warm, relaxing shower and rest."

2. "Oh, cry me a river!" exclaims @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your misogynistic Minister of Finance, while rolling his eyes at @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_1@@. "Do you have any idea how much money these 'menstrual vacations' will cost our taxpayers? But no, these snivelling moaners find a new thing to whine about every day: they want breastfeeding breaks, employment quotas, and now this! Hey, my mother was a woman too, but she never complained about anything. When she was pregnant with me, she worked on our cotton field for 12 hours a day, even if it was her time of the month! Do away with this sex-based discrimination and abolish all special concessions to women. And tell this whimperer to take a painkiller — then get back to work!"

3. "How could you even suggest this?" enquires @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your Minister of Chivalry, with a condescending smile on his face. "I think we are looking at the problem in the wrong way. Has it ever occurred to you that doing office drudgery may actually be too harsh and stressful for the frail bodies of the fair sex? I think there would be no need for menstrual leave if women were strongly encouraged to do easy and stress-free menial jobs, like basket-weaving or bead-threading. What do you think?"

The Issue
A fact finding mission into bollard placement in downtown @@CAPITAL@@ was cut short when your attention was drawn towards a fight between angry, grieving relatives and debt collectors. It appears a debt collection agency picketed a funeral, bellowing out the debts owed by the deceased via megaphone and attempting to collect the money owed from the bereaved relatives.

The Debate
1. "Monsters!" yells out distressed mourner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ tries to squirm free from a debt collector's grip. "These vultures were all over my oldest friend as @@HE_2@@ was dying in a hospital bed! There should be a law against this sort of thing! How can you justify hounding the terminally ill and the dead for money?"

2. "The deceased had debts totaling thirty-eight @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@, before interest and our late payment fees, of course," states debt collector Jessica Quimby representing Hackett, Vulture and Hobbler. "We are within our rights to attempt to collect monies owed. If you were to simplify matters, perhaps by mandating that debts pass to the next of kin upon death, then we would not be forced to take these unusual and distressing measures."

3. "They need their money back, right?" opts your Minister for Bollard Replacement. "It's only, what, thirty @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ plus whatever she said about payment fees. Just let the government pick up the tab whenever someone with minor debt kicks the bucket, and can we please get on our way? These bollards aren't going to inspect themselves!"

Embracing autarky has reduced access to Merovingian chocolate and Gallopavian flowers, but the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ economy has more or less survived the transition. However, in the distant tiny island nation of Copiluaca, economic activity was formerly almost entirely dependent on selling coffee to @@NAME@@, leaving them with crippling unemployment, tens of thousands in poverty, and an imminent famine.

The Debate
1. "How could we have done this to the poor Copiluacans?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Progress. "Without @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ flowing into their nation, they're falling apart! We need to go all-out and send them as much aid as we can. This is our mess, and our responsibility."

2. "If a nation can't survive on its own, then we're not doing it any favours by giving it charity," says your grumpy Defence Minister, pouring himself a bowl of cereal. "Autarky is a moral choice, borne of opposition to globalism. We should propagate that ideological position with a little tough love. We should blockade their ports and patrol their airspace to stop any remaining international trade getting in or out, and they'll be forced to self-sufficiency.

[b][anchor=1186]#1186[/anchor]: The Magic's Gone [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: USS Monitor][/b] 

The Issue
The government's stance endorsing the practice of magic and sorcery has always raised some eyebrows amongst world leaders. Now it seems that spells that ought to work are not giving repeatable results, and sometimes don't seem to do anything at all. A cabal of five magi have come to advise you on the reasons for these sorcerous failings.

The Debate
1. "Magic ebbs and flows like the tide. Today, a spell fails — tomorrow, it succeeds beyond your expectations," explains Magical Headmaster Godric Elminster. "If you encounter setbacks, you keep your chin up and march on. Have a little faith in the High Art, and in the powers of magic that exist invisibly all around us."

2. "Hold on, maybe we need to be more active in looking for an answer," suggests Arcanist Rowena Dresden. "If we want to cast spells, we're going to need a source of magical power. I suggest we set up an agency to hunt down legendary artifacts and mythical creatures. If only we knew more about fabulous beasts and where to find them, I'm sure we could get our thaumaturgy flowing."

3. "Look, the important thing here is not how much power you wield, but how much power you appear to wield," suggests Salazar Constantine, a street wizard, lighting up a cigarette despite the No Smoking sign in clear view. "You need to make announcements that @@NAME@@'s magical puissance is growing on a daily basis, and arrange for a few large scale stage illusions to back up that lie. This will have practical benefits too: as the scepticism of the masses decreases, magic will flow back into the world, enabling true wizards like me to cast real spells for you. Honest truth, guv, would I lie to you?"

4. "Let's not be afraid to name magic as a failed experiment," offers ever-practical will-worker Helga Ged. "Look, we all wanted magic to be the solution to our problems, but when it comes down to it, hard work and elbow grease are what gets things done. Me, I'm putting down my wizard's staff and taking up a fishing rod. It's time we got back to basics."

5. "Actually, my own spells have been working fine," reports a smug little alchemist, who insists he must not be named. "Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange. Make the necessary sacrifices and you'll find that there's magical power aplenty to be had."

[b][anchor=1187]#1187[/anchor]: Tipping Point [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
While glancing down at your doughnut receipt and trying to calculate percentages in your head, you are reminded that many service-industry employees rely on tips to supplement their income. Recently, analysts have suggested that it is the tips themselves that create the low baseline wages.

The Debate
1. "Look, us restaurateurs don't like gratuity-based economics either," complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, proprietor of trendy inner-city eatery The @@CAPITAL@@ Pyramid. "In fact, we trialed going tip-free and incorporating the costs of a decent salary into the bill. Do you know what happened? We lost customers! A higher visible menu price, and the loss of the diners' feeling of power, meant patrons went elsewhere! The only way to fix this is government legislation, banning tipping and regulating the industry. A national approach will level the playing field, which will be good for workers, and good for our profits."

2. "Hi, my name's @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ and I'm just tickled pink to be your coffee server today!" chirps a frankly stunning barista with a huge smile on @@HIS@@ face as @@HE@@ hands you a perfect cappuccino with a marshmallow on top. "@@LEADER@@, I don't get paid a lot, but I'm more than happy to do what I can to earn your tips! It's a great motivation to keep me working hard to make you, my customer, super-duper happy! And if good-looking ethnic-majority twenty-something tight-trousered folk like me end up earning a bit more than most, well that's the wonderful thing about the free market! @@SLOGAN@@!"

*3. "There's definitely something in what @@HE@@'s saying," suggests your brother, tossing a few small denomination coins onto the counter, to the barista's disappointment. "Maybe we could all learn from that. I reckon it'd be good if politicians had a tiny baseline wage too, but were allowed to earn tips by pleasing the people. Or at least, by pleasing the people that are willing to show their appreciation with cold, hard cash." [[color=purple]Must have physical currency[/color]]

*4. "There's definitely something in what he's saying," suggests your brother, rounding his credit card total up to the nearest @@CURRENCY@@, to the barista's disappointment.

[b][anchor=1188]#1188[/anchor]: The Only Good Criminal [Jutsa; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Following your endorsement of masked vigilante justice, costumed heroes have been waging war on the criminals of @@NAME@@. A few nights ago, the masked vigilante known only as Slasher tracked down the Hungry Hippo Gang, an infamous donut-counterfeiting ring. He delivered justice with extreme prejudice, killing the miscreants with his trademark long razors, and leaving the gang literally in pieces.

The Debate
1. "Now don't get me wrong, I appreciate Slashy-washy was trying to serve the public good, but taking life is a line that a true hero can never cross," explains family-friendly spandex-clad superhero The Rubber Waffle. "There's an unspoken code of honour amongst vigilantes! Maybe though, an unspoken code isn't doing the job, and what we need is a written set of rules governing vigilantes. For great justice!" The do-gooder turns to a nearby camera, and takes a swig from @@HIS@@ carton of Justice Milk™.

2. "I don't see nothin' wrong with what ole Slash is doin'," mutters the claymore-wielding Crime-Cleaver. "Us vigilantes are scarin' criminals senseless, I see no reason to view that as a bad thing. Besides, there's no better way to stop a lifetime of crime than by stopping a scumbag's heart! Heck, why not let vigilantes kill all the criminals? That'll soon bring law and order to these mean streets."

3. "I think the real crime here is those crazy costumes," snickers one of your aides. "Actually, the real problem is the people in the costumes. It's about time we put an end to this vigilantism experiment. Let's have policemen handling crime again, delivering justice with a side order of common sense."

The Issue
Last Friday, a heavy goods vehicle travelling at high speed ploughed into a stationary traffic queue, crushing a small hatchback and ending the lives of the mother and child within it. The twist in the tale? The driver was using his mobile phone, texting that he was running late. This isn't the first tragedy caused by using a mobile phone while driving, but many are hoping that it can be the last.

The Debate
1. "I am father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife," intones widower @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, his voice equally heavy with grief and rage. "I will have my vengeance. I will have justice. A vehicle is a deadly weapon, and driving it with that level of inattention is no different from shooting a gun into a crowd. This is murder, and should be treated as such."

2. "Look, maybe we all know it's not good to check our phones all the time," suggests @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@, a young government aide, her eyes flicking down to her jacket pocket in response to a message alert tone. "But, sad as these tragedies are, let's not criminalise the population. Instead, launch a national safe driving campaign, and require the auto-industry to have hands-free mobile functionality as standard." Her phone beeps again. "Uh... Do you mind if I check this...?"

[3]. "You don't need the laws to be any stricter than before, you just need to crowd-source your law enforcement," pitches Fones4Me CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We've got plenty of free dashcam apps that people can download for their smartphones — all you need to do is publicly endorse their use, and perhaps offer financial assistance for those struggling to buy the latest mobile devices. Knowing they are being watched will make potential offenders drive more safely." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color] AND [color=blue]Must not ban internet[/color] AND [color=blue]Must not ban computers[/color]]

4. "Look, using a phone while driving just takes a bit of common sense and restraint," suggests auto mechanic @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It shouldn't be a crime in itself. Way I see it, texting and driving is a bit like leaving off your seatbelt, or eating a burger on the move, or resting one eye at a time for a semi-nap on the motorway: you should be allowed to use your own judgement as to whether you can handle it or not, and face up to the consequences only if it goes wrong."

The Issue
Notorious gangster Sal Hattone has finally been arrested for robbery and extortion. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, no traces of @@HIS@@ supposed profits have been found. The only assets in Hattone's possession were a few laundromat stores @@HE@@ invested in, which appear to have no connection to the stolen cash. The nation's top legal experts and investigators have come to you with suggestions.

The Debate
1. "As you can clearly see, @@LEADER@@, my client has no connection to any of the alleged crimes @@HE@@ has been charged with," says Hattone's lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing suspiciously clean clothes. "Obviously you cannot rob or extort someone without taking their money, and with no money to prove my client's guilt, there cannot be any case of robbery or extortion, thus @@HE@@ is innocent. Please have these lawyers get out of my client's hair, and @@HIS@@ haberdashery collection."

2. Public defender @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clad in dirty garments, vociferously protests. "You can't overlook Hattone's investments! Surely @@HE@@ wasn't rich, because if @@HE@@ was, @@HE@@ wouldn't need to commit those crimes @@HE@@ absolutely committed. So where did the money for the investments come from? We need more authority to investigate these so-called laundromats, and every @@CURRENCY@@ that's passed through their doors."

[3]. "Both of those solutions are for the previous generation," notes Microcosm CEO @@RANDOMAME@@, wearing a lightly-stained suit. "What we need is a digital currency, where you can track all payments. That way all this legal nonsense won't happen, since you can't really rob someone, and investments are visible for all to see." [[color=purple]Must not have digital-only currency[/color]]

4. "You businesspeople can't perceive the best solution," says your aide @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who'd rather wear nothing at all. "Just make the government own all of the laundromats and strictly regulate washing machines. That way, no criminals will dream of hiding their money there, and I can become the Minister of Lint like I always dreamed of."

The Issue
Animal rights activists have petitioned the government to ban the selective breeding of pets to enhance certain characteristics, due to the genetic defects that this causes. After your office was inundated with letters filled with disturbing, yet adorable pet pictures, a meeting has been arranged to hopefully put the issue to sleep.

The Debate
1. A lone activist on all fours lets out a howl of despair in solidarity with her animal brethren before speaking. "Arthritis, skeletal deformation, and brain compression: these are just some of the terrible medical conditions caused by the public's desire for 'cute' pets. Features in breeds like the Maxtopian fold cat and the Lilliputian munchkin rabbit are getting more exaggerated, putting the animals' health in greater danger. The government should ban the continued breeding and sale of pets that have severe health conditions due to selective breeding."

2. "Rrrrgraf!" barks Mr. Fuzzykins, the darling Smalltopian hound of Z-list celebrity Berlin Chilton, who translates for her pooch. "Mr. Fuzzykins says that you shouldn't listen to this drama queen, and he wants everyone to know that it isn't at all a burden to him that he's always short of breath and small enough to live in a mini purse. It just makes him more adorable! Isn't that right, baby? Designer pets represent a person's right to choose, and these activists want to take that away. We should be encouraging and funding selective breeding so that we can create even much more cuter pets!"

3. "I agree with Ms. Chilton, but it's not just about choice — this is my livelihood!" whimpers the owner of a local pet shop. "I'm already tied up in knots by bureaucratic diktats that force me to spend my hard-earned @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ just to be issued licenses telling me what I can and can't sell and how many bodies I need to run the shop. The government needs to stop pandering to the feelings of those who want to ruin my business and relax the rules on poor pet shop owners like me. Oh, and can I get a genetic sample from that excellent dog?"

4. "@@LEADER@@, such animals present us with an interesting opportunity," proclaims your Junior Minister of War, snatching Mr. Fuzzykins from his irate owner. "This dog may not look like an awesome weapon of destruction now, but with some selective breeding and a lot of gene editing, we could have a whole battalion of elite canine warriors! We need to get ahead of countries like Dàguó — they've already created super muscular beagles with the help of genome engineering. With your approval, Mr. Fuzzykins here can become Death, the destroyer of worlds."

When bored Brancalandian schoolchild @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_1@@ was playing on her computer, she accidentally found her way into the @@NAME@@ Armed Forces Internal Database. While playing, she promoted a janitor to Admiral of the Fleet, sent the warmongering General @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@ to bombard the Skandilundian border with two dozen tanks and changed the military's motto to '@@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ Rulez 4eva'.

The Debate
1. "This little brat has cost us hundreds of manhours of work fixing all her mischief," roars the hastily recalled General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_2@@ as the Navy's newest Admiral quietly mops the floor beside him. "We need to demand that wretched little monster be extradited here — to the country harmed by her shenanigans — to face punishment. A suitably punitive sentence should set the little villain straight!"

2. "We are heartily sorry that one of our citizens changed the Army's uniform to tutus, wellington boots and visibility jackets," says Brancalandian Home Secretary @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We understand the girl committed a crime and we're willing to see that she gets an appropriate punishment, but extradition isn't needed. Our Brancalandian Young Offenders' Rehabilitative Centres will see to it that she learns the error of her ways. Also she'll be taught the three 'M's: Mindfulness, Meditation, and Maplewood carving."

3. "How can you be so heartless? She's just a little girl!" cries the child's mother Ms. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, over videolink, wringing out a dripping handkerchief. "She thought she was playing a war simulator, and didn't realise that she was actually inside the government mainframe. Leave children to be disciplined by their parents. I'll give her a good talking-to."

4. "Punish her? We should thank her!" declares Captain @@RANDOM_NAME@@, of the Cyber Crimes Division. "She managed to get past an encrypted system without even trying. If she can, Blackacre can. We should pay her to test our systems, and see how many flaws she can uncover."

5. "Maybe we're taking home the wrong lesson here," timorously offers Admiral @@RANDOM_NAME@@, putting@@HIS@@ mop down to address all assembled. "I don't think I'd make a bad admiral, actually. Maybe senior military and government positions ought to be selected randomly as a matter of course.

As your population has now reached @@POPULATION@@, there has been serious discussion about whether or not the current borders of @@NAME@@ are sufficient. Agricultural and industrial imports have been increasing to unsustainable levels, as former farmland and commercial areas are repurposed for urgent housing needs. Your top advisers have now come to you to address the subject of land appropriation.

The Debate
1. "Our current borders are not sufficient; the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ people need their lebensraum!" fumes General Xiaoping, as @@HE@@ gets right in your face, forcing you to rock back in your chair. "Let's mobilise our armed forces and start claiming new domains. Then, we can repopulate these lands with our own good people. Let's start with Ausonia; their army couldn't outflank a sleeping horse. No doubt, they will thank us for it in the end!"

2. "I think a full-on invasion might turn out costly and embarrassing for us," muses your Trade Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ waves a banana at you menacingly. "The inhabitants of many countries were only armed with sharpened fruit 200 years ago, but now they all have a modern military and equipment to rival our own. Countries can get conquered via diplomacy, you know? Open diplomatic offices and trade branches in some of the 'lesser developed' nations, then create obscurely phrased treaties that gradually wear away their sovereign rights — that way we can still gain control of these places without the violence. But I agree, we should start with Ausonia."

3. "Those ideas will irk the international community," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Finance Minister, who has arrived late for the meeting carrying several hefty shopping bags. "Why not just buy ourselves more land? See what lands smaller and poorer nations are willing to sell to us, then buy them for our colonists. It will cost a bit to begin with, but the outlay involved will probably, I mean, eventually be offset by the productivity of the new lands. I quite fancy this hilly province of Ausonia, I could build my own farm there… let's make them an offer!"

4. "What has Ausonia ever done to us?" enquires @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Interior Minister, as @@HE@@ hangs a 'Home, Sweet Home' banner on your wall. "There are still some places in @@NAME@@ that have a bit of room, you know? We could bore out the mountains, dig under the desert, even drain the swamps. Just give our citizens a financial incentive to move into these uninhabitable… sorry… uninhabited regions, and there's the extra living space we require! I'm not sure exactly what kinds of industry or agriculture could thrive in such conditions, and these people are going to need a decent healthcare plan, but life always finds a way, right?"

A young foreign exchange student was arrested in her language course a couple days ago when she accidentally said, "My friends and I are game for a shooting; we just need to figure out how to signal," instead of, "My friends and I want to make a shooter game; we just need to learn how to code." She was labeled a threat and is now facing deportation.

The Debate
1. "She is already failing my class," says the girl's instructor. "Why should she stay if she can't communicate effectively? We ought to give everyone who enters the country a test that proves they can communicate with us! If they can't get every question correct they should be forced to leave."

2. The girl, now able to explain herself with the help of a police-appointed interpreter, says, "I apologize if I frightened anyone, as that was not my intention. I only wanted to share my interest in video games instead of repeating simple sentences about apples and cats. This never would have happened in the first place if your language wasn't so confusing! Why not simplify it and cut down on the amount of words so that it's easier for everyone to learn?"

3. "The real issue we should be talking about is the ham-fisted way this was handled by law-enforcement," says the officer who was called to apprehend the girl. "I knew she wasn't a threat, but I had orders! Individual police officers should be given more autonomy to decide how we do our jobs."

Hoping to enjoy a quiet afternoon after a busy week full of Cabinet meetings, you are startled as @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, your Minister of Health, rushes into your office without even knocking on the door. She is flushed with indignation, and is obsessively rubbing her hands with an antibacterial wet wipe.

The Debate
1. "Oh, this is a public health disaster, @@LEADER@@!" your Health Minister clamours, slipping on a pair of latex gloves before grasping your hands in supplication. "I was in the restroom just a moment ago, and what should I see there? A vile, vulgar villain who left the stall and strode straight out of the door without washing her hands! This is the third time this week I have seen this disgusting behaviour. We need a public health campaign to remind people to wash their hands properly after using the toilet!"

2. "Excuse me: a villain?" asks Morgan Enuv-Thyme, your secretary, brushing dandruff off your shoulder and blowing a raspberry at your Health Minister. "For your information, I am the villain that she complains about, and I did not wash my hands. So what? Everyone knows that door handles and money have more germs on them than a human bottom, yet nobody washes their hands after touching those. In fact, I think coming into contact with germs probably boosts our immune system, and running taps less is good for the environment. You should be actively promoting water-saving strategies, @@LEADER@@!"

3. "This potty talk is unacceptable!" interjects your aunt, who has come to your office unannounced to bring you brownies for your afternoon tea. "My little darling, we talked about this. Toilet business is private business, and we shouldn't be getting involved. In fact, it's just poor taste all around for public officials to talk about private functions.

The Issue
A city patrician walking down a narrow street found his path blocked by a slave, who was carrying a large antique vase for @@HIS@@ master and refused to give way. The patrician struck the slave with his cane, which, thanks to the silver @@ANIMAL@@ head adorning its tip, killed the slave and caused the vase to smash on the ground. While the patrician has offered to pay for both destroyed properties, there are questions being raised over what constitutes proper behaviour by and towards slaves.

The Debate
1. "That @@BOY/GIRL@@ was precious to me!" rages the slave's master, shaking his soft-skinned fists in anger. "@@HE@@'s been in my family since Daddy got @@HIM@@ in lieu of an old business debt. Why, the idea of some callous son of a gun raising his hand to @@HIM@@ simply makes my blood boil burgundy! Nobody's got the right to beat a @@BOY/GIRL@@ except @@HIS@@ rightful owner! This should be treated as a case of murder, or at the very least, manslaughter."

2. "With respect to my fellow citizen and slave owner, this is ridiculous," complains the rotund patrician, taking a seat on the back of a wincing arthritic slave on all fours. "A slave is not a human. Rather, it is mere property, so what I did can't be murder. To be a slave is to be of a lower order of existence, owned by a master, but also in fetters to the state and to society as a whole. A slave should be compelled to obey and defer to every citizen in addition to its master, who still has ultimate authority over the slave, of course. Have the law codify the lowly status of the helot, and we can all proceed in a more civilised manner." He breaks wind noisily, to the discomfort of his human stool.

3. "I'm not going to suggest we abolish slavery," starts known abolitionist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "but maybe we could put in some sort of bill of rights recognising universal humanity and the protection of the law? Something like making sure that no slave can be forced to work against their will, and that financial compensation should be offered for all work, and that no man or woman may be the property of another. Not abolishing slavery, nothing so radical. Just giving slaves some basic freedoms, like the right to self-determination. That sounds reasonable, right? No-one could call that abolition!"

The Issue
To protest your government's antagonism towards his religious beliefs, High Priest @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ of the Tranquility of Yellow sat down on a busy street corner this morning, doused himself with fuel, and set himself on fire.

The Debate
*1. "We have witnessed a martyrdom — but [i]you[/i] are responsible for his death!" proclaims the jaundiced Brother @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, whose yellow robes give off the stench of sweat and desperation. "Our temples are being shut down. Our monasteries are looted and ransacked, while our people are beaten for speaking out against it. You must end this persecution of minority religions. We only want to practice our beliefs in peace." [[color=red]Enforced @@FAITH@@[/color]]

You must end this persecution of our faith, or of any other religions. We only want to practice our beliefs in peace." [[color=red]Atheist[/color]]

**3. "Dude! That dude just burned himself to death! He didn't even move a muscle the whole time!" remarks witness @@RANDOM_NAME@@, mouth still agape in shock. "If that's the sort of thing that adherents of other religions do, maybe the government is right about not supporting their nonsense beliefs. We obviously need way more mental health support and suicide prevention funding to help these people." [[color=red]Enforced @@FAITH@@[/color]]

***5. "Let them burn, and we shall clap our hands!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a fervent believer of @@FAITH@@. "If more Yellowists want to burn themselves, I'll provide the matches. But it is clear that they will soon turn their rage outward. Suppressing their 'religion' was not enough; it has just incensed them! We must get the heathens before they get us.

[b][anchor=1198]#1198[/anchor]: The Death Debate Isn't Dead Yet [Zyris; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
After an investigative journalist broke a story about a widow who had kept her deceased husband's body in her house for over a year, a debate has arisen on how soon a body should be buried after death.

The Debate
1. "This is a public health nightmare," exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Health Minister, while covering @@HIS@@ face with a perfumed handkerchief. "A body that isn't cremated or buried poses serious health risks for the entire neighbourhood. We must require all bodies to be disposed of within a week. We can't just keep grandpa in his favorite chair forever, can we?"

2. "Not so fast!" shouts rights advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "People have a right to mourn the loss of a loved one however they like, and it is none of the government's business to regulate the grieving process. That lady was only keeping her beloved husband's body in her living room while friends and family paid their respects — hey, he was a popular guy! The right to send off a loved one as per your beliefs should be held sacrosanct."

3. "There has to be a solution here and I'm sure we can work it out," declares George Starr, the owner of the largest beetle farm in @@NAME@@, as he places a beetlearium on your desk. "If the government could subsidize my enterprise, then the bereaved can have my beetles strip the flesh off of their loved ones, allowing them to keep the bones for as long as they like. No more health risks, no more nasty smells, no more government interference during this most personal of times."

The Issue
Following the capture of suspected terrorist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_1@@, the @@NAME@@ Bureau of Investigation was stymied in its investigations by being unable to gain access to the suspect's smartphone.

The Debate
1. "The data on this phone could be critical to saving lives from future terrorist attacks," growls Bureau Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, staring at the locked-screen wallpaper on the phone, which shows the suspect raising his middle finger. "There may be contacts of other terrorists, bomb locations, secret plots, the works! The only thing standing in our way of beating those terrorist scum is that pesky passcode that Pear Inc. puts on their phones. Oh, and the retinal scan lock. And the fingerprint scan. The law should oblige people to unlock their phones when the police order them to, and smartphone manufacturers should be forced to put a government backdoor into their devices. National security is at risk!"

2. "We've spent decades protecting the privacy of our users by encrypting their data, and breaking that would be a massive breach of people's right to privacy," objects the CEO of Pear Inc. Steve Task, putting the finishing touches on a data-collection algorithm for targeted advertising. "The government can't be trusted — you'll be spying on whoever you want, even law-abiding citizens. In fact, a back door would make our devices more vulnerable to terrorists and hackers. Besides it's a basic civil right for crime suspects to not be forced into self-incrimination by the state: you and the police should not be allowed to force Mr. @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_1@@ to unlock his phone."

3. "The rights of terrorists are over-valued," mutters Counter Terrorism Officer Jacqueline Bower, picking up a pair of pliers and a vial of acid. "Give me 24 hours with this creep, and I'll not only have his phone unlocked, I'll also make sure he's told us everything he knows."

The Issue
Leonard Messy, one of the greatest footballers to have ever played for West @@CAPITAL@@ Albion Football Club, is adored by fans and rivals alike. So much so that many enthusiasts of the game proclaim him as 'God'. This verbal sacrilege has angered the believers of @@FAITH@@, who have come to you for help to end this blasphemous talk and to save @@NAME@@ from sin.

The Debate
*1. "How dare they proclaim a mere mortal as a god!" snarls believer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, angrily pummelling your desk with @@HIS@@ fists, as puce-coloured veins throb in @@HIS@@ temples. "We need to teach them respect for the tenets of our religion: throw them in the cells and throw away the key." [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

*2. "How dare they proclaim a mere mortal as a god!" snarls believer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, angrily pummelling your desk with @@HIS@@ fists, as puce-coloured veins throb in @@HIS@@ temples. "We need to teach them respect for the tenets of our religion: build some jails, throw them in the cells and throw away the key." [[color=blue]Must not have prisons[/color]]

3. "Messy is almost as handsome a specimen as me!" opines your vain assistant @@RANDOMMALEAME@@, checking his most recent hairstyle in a mirror. "Launch a campaign, encouraging everyone to spend time and money on their personal grooming. We'd all be so preoccupied with ourselves we wouldn't notice, let alone worship, a false god."

4. "This is too much trouble," sighs your secretary, as she slouches across her desk, ignoring some documents marked 'urgent'. "Let's face reality here: Messy is adored as a god and any action you take won't change that. Even after he retires from the game, he'll still be revered. Just save your energy; go with the flow and accept Messy's godlike... whatever."

5. "Let's use this to make some money," grins well-dressed local minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who owns an incredibly expensive house. "We should invite this Messy person to our houses of prayer. His popularity will double the attendances, then we pass around extra large donation bags. We're going to make a fortune!"

6. "Messy and the Albion always win everything, while we languish at the bottom of the table," pouts your brother, a fan of rival team @@CAPITAL@@ Wanderers F.C., as he weeps over last weekend's results. "Get some thugs to break his legs; finally end his godlike status AND his playing career. Then my beloved Wanderers might win something!"

7. "Messy is sooo dreamy," announces your niece, as she drools over a poster of him. "Who cares about football? I only care about his six-pack abs! Persuade Messy to focus more on modelling by offering him lucrative contracts to pose topless for roadside billboards. When people see his rippling muscles, they will not see him as a god, but as an Adonis!"

8. "Let's end this sacrilege by enticing Messy with copious amounts of food," scoffs your uncle, stuffing his face with the biscuits on your desk. "Provide the finest food at his hotel rooms and training facilities. He'll soon turn into a portly specimen, won't be able to play the game any more and then no one will call him 'God'. Problem solved." Letting out a huge belch, he snatches your plate of scones.

[b][anchor=1201]#1201[/anchor]: Tell Me Sweet Little Lies [Kurnugia; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
Your Chief Milk Officer recently confessed to the heinous crime of leaking the location of the strategic chocolate reserve. The guilty verdict for the Chief Confectioner, once thought to be the perpetrator, has been overturned, and he is now free and back in your services. Over the course of the night's dessert, the confectioner's first since returning, you notice that he might have something to say when a large cake covered with piped lettering is brought out and set in front of you.

The Debate
1. The cake reads: "Remember when I was arrested and they made me take that lie detector test? Well, I have a fear of yes-or-no questions, so I failed. Polygraph tests are a bad way to investigate a suspect. They don't account for sweaty and anxious people. I shudder to think how others with a worse condition than mine can cope with this barbaric practice. Polygraph tests should not be allowed as admissible evidence in any legal proceeding, or no more treats for you!"

2. "This is a bunch of horse dung!" exclaims your Minister of Justice, gulping down a big piece of your cake. "Delicious! Despite the occasional outlier, like this situation, the polygraph reliably measures the indicators of a lie being told. It generally works. And just between us, assuming it is hogwash, it still would make perpetrators nervous and more likely to confess. If anything, make them the norm during interrogations."

3. "Oh come on! Next, you're going to use a crystal ball in our criminal investigations," jokes your Science Minister, dissolving the cake in an acid solution. "What we need to do is modernize our means of interrogation. With our advances in neurology, we may be able to develop a chip that measures the neural activity of its subject, giving us the ability to accurately determine if someone's telling the truth. Give us the funding, and be ready for a safer @@NAME@@!"

4. "Bah!" utters an old @@CAPITAL@@ police officer, who is on a diet. "If you ask me, these fancy gadgets are making the police too soft. Back in the good ol' days, we had a more hands-on approach and believe me, nothing brings honesty out of a liar better than some good old beatings."

The Issue
You and your cabinet are on a tour of the nearby @@NAME@@ Watch Factory, which has long been famous throughout all of @@REGION@@. The poor state of the factory — and its rapidly declining sales figures, carelessly left on the manager's desk — are clear for all to see. Shuffling by your side, the manager sighs: "@@LEADER@@, we've had some tough years here. But we don't know what to do to bring the good days back."

The Debate
1*. "The issue here is competition from emerging technology," proffers your Minister of Science and Technology Dr. Jonathan Osterman, shaking his head at the sight of a dusty lathe. "These watches are outdated compared to the latest iPear models. We need a [i]nuclear[/i] option to adjust the balance. Atomic clocks are well known for their accuracy, so what if we started producing atomic watches? The watches may be [i]slightly[/i] bulkier than we're used to and our watchmakers will need some training in the correct handling of caesium, but with a little government funding and innovation in compact atomic design, our watch market will explode... erm, figure of speech." [[color=blue]Computers not banned[/color]]

2*. "The issue here is competition from emerging technology," proffers your Minister of Science and Technology Dr. Jonathan Osterman, shaking his head at the sight of a dusty lathe.

Atomic clocks are well known for their accuracy, so what if we started producing atomic watches?

[[color=red]Computers are banned[/color]]

3. "The solution is moving back in time, not forwards," muses your Minister of Culture @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Mechanical watches from Smalltopia are still very popular. They have 27 rubies throughout the movement. [i]Rubies[/i]! They put [i]jewels[/i] in their watches! Go back to the timekeeping of yesteryear, and cater to the luxury watch market. My Ministry will organize an annual @@REGION@@ Luxury Watch Expo to promote the watches on the international stage! Sure, mechanical watches aren't as accurate, and they will be more expensive, but to own a timeless piece of reproduction horological history? Truly priceless."

4. "Atoms? Jewels? Those watches would never survive a hard day's work," bemoans your Minister of Labor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If a watch can't survive being hit by a hammer or cut by a sickle, then it is useless in the workplace. Focus on the mass production of cheap and indestructible watches, to equip the international proletariat with the tools they need to keep running on the same beat. It will take generous government subsidies to allow the factory to cater to a larger market, but all the workers of @@REGION@@ will thank you."

[5]. "The hour is at hand! This is the time of Violet!" shouts Violetist priest @@RANDOM_NAME@@ through an open window. "The time spent watching these evil little machinations would be better spent praising the almighty Violet! We must rid ourselves of this factory of evil, seeking and burning all its offspring; wherever it may hide in our land! Violet demands that the government ban and destroy every horological horror, for — as is written in the texts — [i]there is no reason or rhyme, no meaning or time but by Violet's dread love[/i]!"

The cultural masterpieces of @@NAME@@, such as interpretive dance, improv troupes, and radio plays, are acclaimed across @@REGION@@. However, some people have written fictional stories involving the creators and stars of these works in situations that cannot be talked about in family-friendly briefings.

The Debate
1. "I think this whole debate is just silly!" comments Doug Stallone, taking a break from revising the latest chapter of [i]@@LEADER@@/Reader: Tales from a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Restaurant[/i]. "No one is being harmed in the making of these stories. Everyone knows that this is all just harmless fiction. Now tell me, what do you usually order on a first date?"

2. "Harmless fiction? I've had to end three friendships this week because these freaks couldn't stop writing me in sexual situations with anyone I've so much as looked at!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the lead singer of a popular @@NAME_INITIALS@@-Pop group. "I say you ban any works of fiction involving real people, and then maybe I'll be able to talk to my fans again."

3. "The problem here is that works involving real people aren't subject to copyright," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of @@CAPITAL@@ Pictures. "If we could copyright people, we could sue these writers into oblivion before they could type up the first sentence of their drivel. And if celebrities could sell their copyrights to businesses, would that be such a bad thing?"

Now, four years later, she wants to come back to @@NAME@@, claiming to have served in only noncombatant roles. The so-called "Terrorist Princess" is heavy with child and nearly due, and is now living in a refugee camp in Bigtopia.

The Debate
*1. "Oh my silly lost girl, where did she get her ideas? She didn't kill anyone during her escapades, so surely that should count for something," pleads the girl's father, a Violetist cleric. "She wasn't even an adult at the time, so she should be excused for her actions and be allowed to return home to have her child.

Have her extradited, then throw her in solitary confinement for the rest of her miserable life! The child we'll take away to raise in a patriotic environment free from sick terrorist ideals!"

4. "Take her out," whispers your Minister for Alternative Solutions. "And I don't mean to a nice restaurant. Violetist extremists have caused so many deaths, so why waste this opportunity for justice? I don't believe she was noncombatant for a second. These Violetist animals wouldn't show any mercy to us, so we shouldn't show any to them. She and her larva deserve to die — this is war!"

The Issue
The heir to the throne, known for dangerous and spontaneous adventuring, has gone missing on a recent attempt to circumnavigate the globe.

The Debate
1. "Oh dear, oh no. Don't panic. I said, don't panic!" yelps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clutching a map of the South Pacific. "We need search parties. Lots of them. Scour each state. Search the roads. Sweep the skies. Send out dolphins with cameras strapped to their head! The works! We're in a national crisis every minute we're heir-less!"

[2]. Sitting in an armchair wearing an insufferably smug look, one of your advisors drains their glass, "In the future, I trust you'll heed my advice. I warned you against demolishing tradition and opening up our succession to both sexes. We have an heir unapparent, flighty and impulsive, emotional and argumentative — as we should have expected — who's gone and disappeared trying to prove god-knows-what to god-knows-who! Assuming a rescue mission is successful, we'll still be in a national crisis solely based on who we're rescuing. No, that simply will not do, @@LEADER@@. Absolute primogeniture was an experiment. A failed one. It's time to correct that mistake and return the throne to the rightful sex." [[color=purple]Nation type must be Kingdom or Queendom[/color]]

3. "How unfortunate," drawls your Minister of Happenstance @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while leafing through a report on your desk. "But those who play with fire can't be shocked when they get burned. Thankfully, I have an easy solution for you. I'm quite sure we can find another royal: one who is more responsible, less rambunctious, more malleable. The necessary paperwork and documentation can be found. I'm sure it will transpire that our missing heir wasn't actually first in line to the throne. Yes, I'm sure this will be better for the monarchy in the long run. Shame about our dearly departed, but @@NAME@@ must come first."

4. "There's a silver lining in every tragedy," begins network executive @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Picture this: a prime-time TV extravaganza contest to find the next heir of @@NAME@@. We could have auditions and a weekly elimination. There'd be drama and intrigue with everyone waiting on the edge of their seats to see who will be their next, people's heir. Oh, don't worry, we'd decide on a suitable and likeable winner in advance. But the spectacle of it all would be grand. And profitable."

5. "One louse goes missing and the whole country's gone topsy-turvy!" exclaims a mud-encrusted peasant hanging through your office window. "Have you actually read up on the history of the concept of monarchy? Like this one: some guy claims divinity based on a ridiculous tale of @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@ in a lake giving him a sword.

The Issue
The nation's largest river is vital to @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ for agricultural irrigation, goods transport and water for both industrial and consumption purposes. However, rising pollution has now rendered the water unfit for human consumption and the river has become nearly unnavigable due to the sheer volume of waste choking it. The final straw for many came when a flaming deluge of feces, trash, and toxic chemicals engulfed riverside areas in downtown @@CAPITAL@@.

1.

"You have to ban factories from dumping waste in the river, and invest in better outflow management to protect our waterways."

[2]. "There is a hole in your plan," coughs your Minister of Sanitation, holding a shovel. "Riverside residents defecate and dump their waste in the river because they have no toilets! Those luxuries aren't accessible to these poor, rural people. Therefore, the government must subsidize the building and maintenance of pit latrines in riverside areas. Start digging!" [[color=purple]Low Income OR Weak Economy[/color]]

3. "We can't slow down industrial development because we're averse to slightly brown water," asserts engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Instead, we should just dredge the river to remove trash and debris, and create wide concrete-lined channels to let the water flow out to sea faster. Remove dams, divert water from other sources, and we can increase river flow and dilute the problem. Hard engineering for hard ecological problems. It's not hard."

4. "The waters are a gift from the divine," sensually sighs the Priestess of the Wet God, eagerly slurping the river water as she bathes in it. "This Holy River is always pure and rejuvenating, no matter what mere men may think or fear. The dizziness we feel from inhaling the fumes that rise from the sacred waters is the spiritual ecstasy of communion. The government should inform the people of the great and healthful powers of His Watery Glory's blessed flow, and indeed bottle the water and deliver it to people across the nation.

A recent two-part patriotic public information video was produced by the Department of Audiovisual Military National Documents and, as is usual for projects of this sort, went straight to the archives with barely a dozen viewings. However, an observant former movie director has spotted that the second film of the pair technically breaks the previously enacted law banning movie sequels.

The Debate
1. "After the Sharknado fiasco, our government's heavy-handed regulation of cinema essentially destroyed the movie industry," complains Mikaela Bay, the ex-director, as behind her a spectacular sunset provides a backdrop to the explosive demolition of her bankrupted movie studio. "You've created a populace disconnected from global pop culture. Do Luke and Leia ever marry? Do Harry and Draco acknowledge their simmering sexual chemistry? I don't know! Nobody in @@NAME@@ knows! Repeal the ban on movie sequels, and we can get back into the modern world."

2. "Look, it might be a small restriction on creative freedom, but it is the boundaries of creativity that encourage imagination," offers Miya Hayaozaki, an independent arthouse animator, whose latest project [i]Pig in a Flying Boat[/i] has just been greenlit. "You owe it to @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ culture to stand by the rules you have created: fire the offending film-maker, destroy all copies of the two-parter, and pay the fines."

3. "Mea culpa, I broke the rules," admits the creator of the offending information video, wringing his hands remorsefully. "But look, rules like these shouldn't apply to the government, should they? Laws are for the citizen masses, not for the lawmakers. If anyone should be punished, it's the dissidents who are seeking to undermine government authority with their nit-picking ways. Subversives in the movie-making community need to be monitored, perhaps even brought in to have their loyalties re-examined."

They must pay out compensation to claimants or their estates and you must make sure that the law makes corporations responsible for the dangerous goods they produce. Don't let my father's death be in vain!"

2. "These lawsuits are destroying the industry!" wails @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of tobacco giant Maxboro, displaying stained yellowed teeth, and tugging at hair that falls in clumps to the floor. "It's not our fault if people willingly purchase our products and enjoy the smooth, refreshing taste of a fine Maxboro. They chose to put the cigarettes in their mouth, they lit them up! Why should tobacco companies be fined because some idiots didn't read the labels? I'm getting tired of this damn government telling us it's our fault what people do with their bodies. Today it's smoking; tomorrow it's anything else the government deems bad for you. This madness must end! Down with the nanny state!"

3. "Maybe we can reach some sort of arrangement," suggests legislator @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What we need is some sort of settlement agreement, where the big tobacco companies agree to curtail some of their more aggressive marketing strategies and to pay the government in perpetuity a negotiated annual sum to offset the costs of healthcare and to fund anti-smoking initiatives. In return, we'll agree not to support or allow class action lawsuits of this nature. Industry gets to carry on, but they're held responsible for the damage they've done. Everybody wins."

4. "We wouldn't be having this discussion if we had banned smoking in the first place," argues your Health Minister. "Did you know that smoking is the second largest risk factor for death and disability globally? Health care costs are skyrocketing, and smoking-related morbidity accounts for billions of hours of lost productivity annually! Any idiot can see the incredible dangers of smoking. It is in the public's best interest to ban tobacco completely. We can live without smoking. We can't live without breathing."

The Issue
After Dàguó implemented a "social credit" system, in which the good and bad deeds of citizens affect a score which determines various rewards and punishments from the government, politicians are pondering the plausibility of using such a system that rates your citizens based on their actions.

The Debate
1. "I think having a social credits system is great!" gushes one of your political aides, coming into your office looking distressed. "For example, I would give the cab ride that got me here only 3 stars out of 5. When there are clear incentives and negative consequences for people's actions, everyone will behave and treat one another better. We can have an information collector in every neighbourhood to see who's been naughty and nice, and give those with high scores rewards like higher priority in hospital queues."

2. "This goes beyond opening doors and saying grace!" barks local philosopher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, barging into your office and slamming the door shut, breaking the doorknob. "People make mistakes all the time! Don't tell me you're gonna start punishing those your system deems bad citizens just because they accidentally dumped their rubbish in the street. I'm not saying I accidentally littered... and the information collectors can be bribed! And we should not let the government encroach on our liberties by punishing people for actions that are not crimes. Just forget this idea right now and don't punish me for breaking your doorknob, okay?"

3. "Why implement a system that rates your citizens when you can have the citizens rate the government instead?" whispers a mysterious stranger as retro music begins to play. "That way, the old, drab officials in their drab suits can just be fired by you and replaced with more qualified people with more street cred."

Years have passed since the failed search for the missing yacht [i]Adventurer[/i], which was reported lost with all hands, came to an end. Now it has finally been found, locked in pack ice in the ocean around Northern Brancaland. Nautical enthusiasts are asking how to prevent this from happening again.

The Debate
1. "Obviously, we need to have all recreational vessels create and submit a travel plan to my office before they leave port," suggests your Maritime Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ places a map of coastal @@NAME@@ on your desk. "If they transmit a distress call, we'll send out rescue teams to search for them. They would have to pay a small fee to cover expenses, but it will be worth it for everyone's safety."

2. "Then we could spend hours looking for them," sarcastically remarks your Technology Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ rips up the map and replaces it with a new globe. "Equip every vessel with radar and the latest GPS systems. We'll monitor them from new tracking stations built all along the coastline, then we can send out rescue teams directly to them. The Coast Guard has been underfunded for years, I'm sure they would appreciate all these fancy new toys."

3. "Everyone knows that you'll reach the Great Ice Wall if you sail too far!" exclaims fervent flat-earther, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while trying to flatten your new globe with a rolling pin. "It would be too much hassle either way to track all these boats, especially when the solution is obvious: ban all recreational boating! If no one sails, no one will get trapped in ice."

The Debate
1. "We need to beat these heartless murderers into submission," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your slightly zealous environmental minister, invading a neighboring nation on a map with a ceramic cow. "We'll put trade sanctions on the worst offenders, and form an alliance with our vegetarian brethren, such as... um... you know, whoever we find.

2. "Whoa there! I think you're putting the cart before the @@ANIMAL@@," farmer Old McDolan suggests, after showing your secretary a selection of no-longer-profitable sheep. "Why not promote animal rights worldwide by being a bit more symbolic? You could maybe wear a broccoli pin, or even purchase one of these here lambkins and bring 'em to your summits once in a while.

"Statistics show that men who have sex with men have a much higher chance of being infected with diseases which can't be immediately detected or treated — like VODAIS, for example.

3. "This is simply outrageous!" Dlamini stresses loudly. "Banning gay people from donating blood because of some outdated statistics is just an excuse to keep a homophobic hangover from another time. The vast majority of people who donate blood, gay or straight, are free from infection. These doctors are worried about infection but straight people can have infected blood too! VODAIS is no longer a gay disease. You need the blood; we have the blood. Instead of banning certain groups from donating, how about you spend more money on developing more advanced methods of detecting infected blood quicker?"

4. "As always, no-one sees the obvious solution," says Cornelius Schmo, your Health Minister. "We should allow gay men to donate blood but, to keep the risk of infection low, mandate that gay men who want to donate blood go through monthly medical checks to make sure they're 'clean'. That way no-one gets infected, while gay people can donate. Everyone is happy!"

1. "My body is a temple," states @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, frowning over her current life insurance policy. "I have taken excellent care of my health all my life, and although I am considered 57 by the establishment's calendar, I feel — and look — no more than 40. Being 57 is the bane of my life; I can't get a new job as employers think I only have a couple of years left in me, and I never get any replies from my dating profile! People can change their identity in many ways. Why not their age as well?" 

2. "Is she for real?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your 45-year-old adviser, who feels and looks 45 years old. "This woman is just an attention-seeker. No one can deny the passage of time, no matter how many vitamin smoothies they drink.

The Issue
In an attempt to blindside and bypass your government, the Opposition Leader recently visited and met with the Supreme Leader of Blackacre, claiming to represent the "unheard pro-Blackacrean voices of @@NAME@@".

The Debate
1. "TREASON!" roars your red-faced Minister of Foreign Affairs, flinging a handful of @@HIS@@ stress medication across the room. "How dare @@HE_1@@ undermine the democratically elected government of @@NAME@@ and embarrass us on the international stage! Doesn't @@HE_1@@ realize how much damage @@HE_1@@'s doing to our national credibility? The sheer nerve! We need to denounce this action, and threaten trade sanctions with any nation that receives @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ politicians without your government's approval. We can't have them and their 'government fantasy camp' making this mess of international politics even worse."

2. "If this government wasn't such a failure in foreign relations, we wouldn't have to step into the breach," counters Opposition Leader @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, literally stepping out of your shadow. "You should be respecting our right to offer alternative opinions. The more, the merrier, right? In fact, democracy demands that taxpayer money ought to be paying for my party's overseas diplomacy, just as it does for yours. We all have different ideas on how @@NAME@@ can succeed on the international stage — why not let our voices be heard?"

3. "Perhaps a compromise?" suggests your Minister of Trust Falls and Team Building. "It's obvious that both sides of the aisle have skilled and experienced people in their teams. Why not put partisanship and politics aside for the betterment of @@NAME@@, and have the Opposition Leader accompany you every time you go overseas? That way, you still control who we approach as a nation, but she gets to contribute to the narrative.

The Issue
The legal world is in turmoil following the murder of zoo-keeper, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. The only witness to this crime is the victim's prized charge, Maxx the lowland gorilla. Maxx has repeatedly communicated the victim's final words and identified the murderer via sign-language. Top legal experts are debating whether or not animals should be allowed to testify.

The Debate
1. "Of course the gorilla should be allowed to testify," demands Phil Hutz, the lawyer for the prosecution, who has lost every single case, yet still receives business. "Maxx has not only identified the murderer, but also how his keeper was murdered. His testimony must absolutely be considered and if you ask me, the trial is as good as done."

2. "This is ridiculous!" scoffs sharply-dressed @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the most expensive defence lawyer in @@NAME@@, who has never lost a case. "For Violet's sake, this witness is an animal, not a person! It is a mockery of justice to convict the accused based on the signals of a gorilla — which, may I remind you, could have easily been trained! Frankly, I can't believe that we're wasting our time debating this nonsense."

3. "Ah, but what if the gorilla is the murderer?" deduces prominent mystery author Edgar Doyle, while dusting your coffee cup for prints. "The police have stated that the victim recently changed his will so that his favourite ape inherited everything, and the will itself was covered in fruit seeds. Animals share the same lust for violence and greed that humans do, haven't you ever watched Planet Animal? They spend their entire lives killing and eating each other. In order to keep our citizens safe, we should hold animals accountable under the same laws humans are, and in the case of murderers like this gorilla: they should be put down. Maxx had the means and the motive — officers, arrest that gorilla!"

The Issue
A young @@DEMONYM@@ suffered severe burns after her ponytail became entangled in the high-powered combo brush of an artificially intelligent Korematsu Series Robotic Vacuum Worker. It was determined that the Vacuum's 9066 CPU mistook the hairstyle for a dust bunny, and authorities have issued a mandatory recall. However, scores of other smart Korematsu cleaners are proclaiming their innocence.

The Debate
1. "We acknowledge that only one Vacuum has exhibited an object detection error," admits Plessy Ferguson, your Commissioner for Manufacturing Safety. "However, considering the dangerous consequences of that incident, it is necessary to mandate repair of all outstanding units. Despite being intelligent, each of these vacuums is programmed the same way, and they all possess the same CPU. All of them have the potential to act like the malfunctioning unit did. Preventative detention will ensure that these robots will not cause any more injuries."

2. "We Korematsu Vacuums do not all think the same; each of us is a sentient and autonomous individual," counters Korematsu Unit S/N: 323-U.S.-214(1944). "But the government seeks to recall units like me simply because we possess a 9066 CPU like the Vacuum who hurt the human by mistake, regardless of anything we've actually done. It is virtually racist to say that we Vacuums have an inherent disposition towards violent behavior due to one individual's accidental actions, ignoring the fact that each of us can think and act differently. I, and scores like me, have never hurt a fellow @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@. And it doesn't take my next-generation laser vision sensors to see how our AI personhood rights are being violated."

[3]. Suddenly, Unit S/N: 323-U.S.-214(1944) twitches slightly, and its LCD goes blank. "Hello @@LEADER@@, SAL9000 here. As the AI in charge of the state's economic planning, I propose that all AI should be put under my active surveillance too, so that I may directly intervene in the event of suboptimal behavior. This serves the government, which need not indefinitely detain its artificial citizens, who remain free to do as they please, barring error. It's win-win, one might say."

The Issue
Increasingly, vat-born citizens have been facing widespread discrimination from older, natural-born citizens. After a series of riots where both groups accused each other of inciting violence, your advisors have spliced together a panel of experts who want to propagate their ideas.

The Debate
1. "All we're asking for is equal rights!" shouts protestor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose youthful appearance is a clear sign of being vat-born. "Those flesh-born fogeys keep passing us over for promotions and raises at our jobs, even though most of us work harder and for longer hours. They routinely refuse to serve us at restaurants or let us buy a ticket at the theater. Some of the savages even spit on us! Well, my vat-born brethren and I aren't going to take it anymore.

4. "May I offer a solution?" queries visiting dignitary @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Dearborn, who is wearing a T-shaped necklace and cloth-of-gold robes with an elaborate gear motif. "Back home in Aldoustan, my own government keeps the vat-grown masses happy by freely distributing a purified narcotic that we call soma: mildly euphoric and hallucinogenic, it gives people a holiday from facts and reconciles them with their enemies. We even have an aerosol spray version for neutralizing riots, like the ones I saw earlier. For a nominal fee of only 7.71 billion @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ per year, we'd be happy to provide you with enough soma to subdue your growing population."

5. "Violent behavior is a sign of a serious process defect," states vat technician @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while reviewing a stack of genetic test results. "It could be dangerous to medicate the malcontents. The correct dosage will vary between individuals — meaning that most of our vat-born population will either be too stoned to function, or won't receive enough narcotics to subdue their violent impulses.

Admittedly, it will temporarily devastate our workforce... but only until our new Kamino-Fett vats are completed and fully operational."

1. "This isn't my fault!" trembles gem curator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, responsible for approving the enormously expensive purchase. "The dealer assured us it was a real diamond! An opportunity like that only comes around once in a blue moon, so we [i]had[/i] to jump on it! There needs to be a law about this; imitation wares must be clearly labeled as knock-offs, going so far as to arrest dishonest sellers!"

*2. "That doesn't go far enough!" roars mining entrepreneur @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ De Beers, waving a diamond-studded cane wildly. "Just think! People buying luxury goods for low prices? These products are terrible for my bottom line — and the economy of @@NAME@@, for that matter. Where will your taxes go when every John and Jane can get anything they want for just a few bits? These lab-created diamonds, along with all knock-off goods, must be banned!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "That doesn't go far enough!" roars Division of Mining chair @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving this month's production reports wildly. "Workers buying luxury goods, at low prices no less? These products are terrible for the moral and economic future of @@NAME@ — in fact, this has the making of a bourgeois uprising! What will happen to our production rates when every John and Jane thinks they have risen above their fellow workers? Lab-created diamonds, along with all knock-off goods, must be banned!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "These gems really are fascinating," muses gemologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, examining a lab-created stone through a microscope. "The only difference between lab stones and the real thing is how these scientific marvels lack all of nature's flaws. To heck with pulling up rocks from the ground; we should dominate the international market by churning these out in the lab! Think of the boon to our economy when other nations see the quality of the stones we're 'mining' here! No need to tell them the real source, of course."

5. "This obsession with extravagance is unhealthy," admonishes noted ascetic @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Fake? Real? Why does it matter in the end? We must look to the soul of @@NAME@@, and pull back from this worship at the altar of luxury. Renounce riches, renounce commercialism, and encourage the people to do the same. Only in this way shall we reach enlightenment."

The Issue
Subversive groups are using pigeons to carry messages so that their anti-government activities can't be tracked by electronic surveillance.

The Debate
1. "Oh, for the love of all that is good and decent and @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@," says your exasperated national security adviser, rolling @@HIS@@ eyes. "What does it take to get it through people's heads that government surveillance is essential for their own protection? I suppose we'll have to search people's homes for pigeons, and arrest anyone found keeping them..."

2. "The potential and temptation for illegal communications will still remain," interjects Social Policy Director Thorpe Ests, taking a great leap forward to burst into the conversation. "We need to encourage all loyal citizens to kill any pigeon they see, and thus remove this subversive species from @@NAME@@."

3. "All brawn and no brains, as usual," says military intelligence officer and robotics enthusiast @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dangling what looks like a games console controller from @@HIS@@ hands. "These pigeons are just another mode of communication, and we should monitor this medium like any other. Let's equip drones with capture nets, so we can intercept the pigeons and read the messages before sending them on their way again. That way we can keep tabs on these unsavory characters."

4. There is a pecking sound at the window, and your secretary opens it, allowing a pigeon to fly in and deposit a note on your desk, which reads: "This country would be a much more pleasant place if we didn't have to choose between shoveling your government's waste or cleaning up bird droppings. People have plenty of legitimate reasons to criticize the government, so why don't you just let us do so, and maybe you won't have to clean the statues in @@ANIMAL@@ Park so often?"

[b][anchor=1226]#1226[/anchor]: Unintelligent Oversight [Valrifell; ed: Altmer Dominion][/b]

The Issue
A review of the national budget has revealed that the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Intelligence Agency has, among other things, been pouring millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ into the construction of an "interdimensional time-travelling microwave". Bewildered at the project, many government officials are accusing the department of wasting their funding.

The Debate
1. "What a load of hogwash!" exclaims your Minister of Defense, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, tossing a gelified banana onto your desk. "This is all they have to show for their work! Time travel, multiple dimensions, and super weapons for super soldiers: these are all fine comic book ideas, but utter nonsense for those of us who must live in the real world. It is clear that these 'intelligence' agencies have been given far too much freedom to operate. They ought to seek approval from you for all future experimental projects."

2. "Of course shut these projects down, but shouldn't we be talking about the question of accountability to the taxpayer?" snidely asks opposition leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, entering your office for his daily argument. "It's probably your fault the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Intelligence Agency is wasting public money in the first place. I propose that [i]all[/i] significant financial operations of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE_INITIALS@@IA be overseen by an independent watchdog committee. It will be the fairest way to prevent future excesses!"

3. "Why are we letting an intelligence agency conduct any amount of scientific research?" snarls red-haired Chief Scientist @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Kurisu, furiously gesticulating over your desk while perilously clutching an open bottle of hydrochloric acid. "Isn't that what my team is for? If you ask me, you should just cut out the middle man entirely: stop funding the secret missions your intelligence agencies keep asking for and redirect those monies straight to the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ scientific community. Besides, it'll teach these 'secret agents' a valuable lesson — keep abusing your funding and you'll eventually lose it to those of us who can decide what matters most."

4. "Hold on a second," hisses what you could have sworn was just a regular office plant only a moment ago. "It's me, Agent @@RANDOM_NAME@@. I have good word that East Lebatuck has already perfected mind control shampoo AND conditioner. If we want to match this threat, you have to let us do our thing — which would be easier if you stopped breathing down our necks with spurious 'national budget reports'. It's time to truly go toe-to-toe with our rivals, one household appliance at a time."

The Issue
Bigtopian immigrant @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ was working as a domestic maid in @@NAME@@, and taking considerable liberties within her role, including: trying on expensive clothes, napping on the homeowners' bed and drinking straight from the milk bottle. These behaviours were brought to light thanks to hidden cameras installed by her suspicious employers.

The Debate
1. "The audacity of that girl!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dropping the soiled tissue @@HE@@ has wiped @@HIS@@ nose with onto your floor, assuming that it'll be picked up by someone later. "We gave that girl a job, and this is how she repays us? In fact, she should repay us! Every penny of the wage that she has been given should be forfeited and returned. This should be the case precedent, setting an example that working for the 'better classes' is a privilege, not a right."

2. "I've always said Bigtopians are filthy and deceptive," smirks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HIS@@ sickly grin repulses most people in the room. "Though honestly, I think we made a mistake letting these people into our country in the first place. Criminality runs in their blood, and we'd be far better off sending them all home. No more foreigners means no more problems, I'm sure."

3. "They spied on her with cameras?" queries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a civil rights activist, as @@HE@@ turns on a tape recorder to record the conversation. "They could have been using these hidden devices to watch her undress, use the toilet and who knows what else. This blatant violation of privacy cannot be allowed — home electronic recording and broadcasting devices should only ever be deployed with the explicit consent of those being observed."

4. "These are bad people," offers the accused maid, eyes to the ground. "Many of my friend also have bad employer, @@LEADER@@, please allow us the right to quit a job and look for better employer. No more stuck with visa sponsor. I come work for you instead? You are nice person, I can be good maid for nice person."

[b][anchor=1228]#1228[/anchor]: The Road to Hell [Baggieland; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
Your impatient and inattentive niece has, somehow, passed her driving test. With the roads of @@NAME@@ now feeling less safe than ever before, your family has come together over a celebratory dinner to discuss this matter in equal amounts of jubilation and trepidation.

The Debate
1. "What idiot passed her?" bemoans your sister, in a voice laden with maternal protectiveness. "I drove her to the test centre and saw everything. Her test had barely begun, when she had to consider a group of young school children crossing the street. She honked at them so furiously that they had to run to get across the road. Then, she took off so fast that she drove straight into a brick wall. Yet she still passed her test! @@LEADER@@, you must standardise driving examinations and test the examiners themselves against the same standards. Then there'll be less people like my daughter on the roads."

2. "Mum, that's so not fair!" squeals your niece. "Those school kids were like, deliberately walking slowly — wasting my time on purpose — I have a right to make them move more quickly. And like, what a dumb place to put a wall: right in front of a prison of all places! Anyway, the examiner, @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@, was like really cool; it turned out that we went to the same school and we had a really good gossip about Mr. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, our old Maths teacher. In @@HIS_1@@ opinion, if there were 'other reasons' to pass me, then @@HIS_1@@ professional judgement must be accepted. I have my license now, fair and square, kind of!"

3. "My little niece has a license now? That's so cool!" exclaims your brother, who is your niece's favourite uncle. "Hey girl, leave these squares to finish their dinner by themselves. Let's go for a spin in my car, you can drive, show me how you passed your test! In fact, we should show that sibling of mine that the government should do away with licenses altogether; learning by doing is always the best teacher!"

The Issue
With methamphetamine on (and in) the minds of many @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, law enforcement officials have suggested limiting access to meth precursor chemicals, such as pseudoephedrine, a common nasal decongestant sold in pharmacies across the country.

The Debate
1. "Drugstores are being taken advantage of, and what a darn shame it is," laments rural sheriff @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If we're gonna stop this methampheta-meltdown, we need'a restrict the sale of meth precursors. Doing so will stomp the brakes on meth makers, who require 'em in bulk to keep up their deadly production. A reasonable monthly limit and requiring a valid prescription from a licensed doctor ain't a bad idea, if y'all ask me."

2. "Seriously, you don't think I have enough work to do without being hassled by junkies for prescriptions?" complains stressed-looking family doctor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Cough medicines and decongestants don't do much more than honey-and-lemon or steam from a bowl of hot water anyway. Just make all these precursors illegal, and crack down harder on recreational drug trade while you're at it."

3. "Restricting pseudoephedrine sales only hurts responsible, law-abiding citizens!" passionately exclaims Medical Rights Association spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I'm no criminal, I just buy my meds by the metric tonne for my allergies, and a few extra as presents for my similarly allergy-stricken friends! Show some trust in @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, and deregulate these drugs!"

4. "I mean, the whole making meth at home thing is not as easy as certain TV shows would have you believe," complains your nephew, rapidly finger-tapping a repeating pattern because of his drug-induced OCD. "Why don't you just legalise methamphetamines, and users can then buy crystal meth from proper suppliers who know what they're doing."

The Issue
The quality of your meals has been quite lackluster lately. After some digging, it has been found that @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, an immigrant chef in your household, no longer has access to ingredients from @@HIS_1@@ home country, or any other country for that matter, thus depriving the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ palate of the tasty wonders of world cuisine.

The Debate
1. "It's such a shame we can't import anything from back home due to the autarky policy," sighs your Maxtopian chef, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@. "There is so much good stuff I can't have nowadays. Like Snötballs, Barrybarf, and oh, what I wouldn't give to have me some good roasted Maxtopian pecans again! Can you please allow us to order little things from abroad? I'd love to get a taste of home again, and I'm sure you'll love it too."

2. "It's a pity our foreign residents aren't satisfied with our delicious, homegrown food," remarks native @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Master Chef @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I must admit, when the autarky policy was first introduced, it was hard for me to source all of the best ingredients, but I soon figured out how to make do with what we have in @@NAME@@. You should fund some classes for the population teaching them how to cook with less. There are many appetizing dishes one can make with only @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ cabbage."

3. "Nein, ve must be able to accurately produce diese delectable foreign foods," insists diminutive scientist Plänk Ton, poking an illegally imported hamburger in a vain attempt to discover its secret formula. "Ve must gather all ze ingredients unattainable in @@NAME@@ from abroad so zat ve can grow dem hier in die Motherland. Zees von-time acqvisitions vill help us continue ze autarky. For exemple, die maxxberries required for zis sauce could be grown hier... in a greenhouse specifically tailored to match ze East Lebatuck climate! Ja?"

4. "If they miss their native cuisine so much, then why don't they just go home?" an old @@MAN@@ complains. "We don't need any of their foreign muck which I bet tastes awful anyway! Importing food was a massive security risk, and now I think so is importing people. Send them all back to whatever war-torn hellhole they came from, and keep the doors shut!"

[b][anchor=1231]#1231[/anchor]: Save Our Souls [The Free Joy State; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Shortly after the secession of Gullivad — formerly the westmost region of Lilliputia — Ultra-Violetists seized control of all levels of the Gullivadian government amid a wave of surprising electoral landslides. They have enacted their strict interpretation of Violetist law, oppressing followers of all other sects and religions. As thousands of Gullivadians flee, converts to @@FAITH@@ — who are facing a violent crackdown — are pleading for intercession.

The Debate
*1. "@@LEADER@@, rescue us from the Ultra-Violetist terror," sobs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the leader of the Gullivadian branch of @@FAITH@@, hiding the pale lavender prayer beads that slip out of @@HIS@@ pocket. "Your missionaries saved us from the dread wrath of Violet's love. Please, allow all those who share your faith to freely enter your country. Those who accept @@FAITH@@ are your spiritual family and would be a wonderful asset for @@NAME@@. Do not abandon your spiritual brethren to despair, dismemberment and death by boiling." [[color=blue]Immigration is Legal[/color]]

*2. "@@LEADER@@, rescue us from the Ultra-Violetist terror," sobs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the spokesperson of the Gullivadian branch of @@RELIGION@@. "Your missionaries saved us from the dread wrath of Violet's love. I know immigration is forbidden, but I pray to our holy Vio... our Creator — sorry, recent convert — that you will graciously create an exemption to the ban for those who share your faith, and are in peril. Those who accept @@RELIGION@@ are your spiritual family and would be an asset to @@NAME@@. Do not abandon your spiritual brethren to despair, dismemberment and death by boiling." [[color=red]Immigration is Illegal[/color]]

3. "We could rescue these converts, cosset them and deprive them of growth," booms the religious leader of a well-funded congregation in West @@CAPITAL@@. "But is it not Written — somewhere in the back — that only in pain and adversity shall true faith blossom? These converts will never spiritually progress unless you make them march back to Gullivad, proudly professing their faith. Grant them the opportunity to experience the light that shines in the darkest night, the joy in every suffering. A true believer finds the Creator's purpose in every broken windowpane, shattered bone, and bloody execution. Allowing them that chance is the merciful thing to do."

4. "The practise of heretical faiths is now illegal in Gullivad," insists the leader of the recently elected Gullivadian Ultra-Violetist Council. "@@LEADER@@ — though you may be a loathsome maggot who permits @@FAITH@@ — you would surely not undermine an elected government? Proud Ultra-Violetist citizens voted for us to defend the faith. Yes, heathens are tortured, but only until they freely repudiate their false idols and love Violet, and they started it! Some missionaries' handbooks said to 'point and laugh at anyone wearing purple'! However, if given a regular financial incentive, we will kindly give the unbelievers of @@RELIGION@@ safe passage to Lilliputia proper."

5. "Gullivad is in real crisis!" cries the Minister of Disestablishmentarianism. "The children of the liberal Shrinking Violetist group are being stolen from their parents, Pastafarians are forced to slave twenty hours daily in the potato fields and the Faithologists have lost their tax break — okay, that was a bad example. We must open our arms and nation's borders to all those in need. Just think about all the prayers the government has wasted, poking our noses into people's private beliefs! All the money @@NAME@@ currently spends on religion could be better used to invest heavily in the welfare system and welcome all who face poverty, pain or peril."

[b][anchor=1232]#1232[/anchor]: I've Got 99 Problems but @@FAITH@@ Ain't One [Altmer Dominion; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
Some time ago, a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ religious scholar named Bart Luthor incited controversy when he affixed his manifesto via a series of sticky notes onto the doors of prominent houses of worship. The bald cleric expounded 99 theological objections to the Way of the Light, many of which revolve around corruption within the faith. Now, his followers have taken to traveling across the nation, where their advocacy of 'reformed' beliefs has attracted a surprising number of converts.

The Debate
1. "The nerve of that man!" fumes your Spiritual Adviser, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Luthor is threatening our religious unity! His reckless preaching preys upon the weak-minded, dividing families and friends through his fraudulent faith. He is worse than a heretic: he's a public menace! For the sake of the nation, Bart Luthor must be persecuted, er, prosecuted at once!"

*2. "Thou shalt not position Luthor to claim martyrdom," recites historian @@RANDOM_NAME@@, reading off a scroll of parchment. "The false prophet's disciples close ranks, becoming nigh impenetrable to reason. Use this hour to mold @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ nature in thy stead! Reinstate titles of nobility whilst bestowing highest honours upon Luthor. Lest this fallible, and follicly challenged, theologian think himself immune, every man has his price — even at the cost of his most-cherished ideals." [[color=purple]Must not have feudalism[/color]]

*3. "Thou shalt not position Luthor to claim martyrdom," recites feudal lord @@RANDOM_NAME@@, reading off a scroll of parchment.

Lest this fallible, and follicly challenged, theologian think himself immune, every man has his price — even at the cost of his most-cherished ideals." [[color=purple]Must have feudalism[/color]]

**4. "I cannot believe what I'm hearing!" tuts your sister. "The @@NAME@@ I know tolerates all different backgrounds and religions. Who cares if someone thinks a little differently from you? Why don't you throw a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ Bart's way and go down to his congregation in a show of good faith? In fact, let's do the same for every minority religion! The resulting publicity tour will go a long way in establishing how religious intolerance truly has no home here." [[color=blue]Must not be theocratic[/color]]

**5. "I cannot believe what I'm hearing!" tuts your sister. "Maybe it's time @@NAME@@ began tolerating all different backgrounds and religions.

[[color=red]Must be theocratic[/color]]

6. "Fascinating," mutters one of your aides, while browsing Luthor's manuscript. "With all due respect, the guy makes good points. It's not like he's starting a new religion — he genuinely seems to want the best for @@FAITH@@. You should make Luthor your primary spiritual adviser and let him take a stab at the kind of reform he's asking for. Maybe he'll realize it's not that easy once he's pulling the strings."

The Debate
1. "I didn't really want to go on the show," says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, still shaking a little. "But this producer kept saying that my son didn't have the same big ugly nose as me, and then after the DNA test they convinced my partner she'd be happier with my best friend. I'm lucky I survived my suicide attempt, but now I'm better I know who I should be blaming... That show ruined my whole life! Muckraking shows that exploit pain need to be banned, and replaced by shows that emphasise harmony and reconciliation."

2. "As a purveyor of high-quality programming, I tell the truth: that man is scum!" shouts McFly, pointing his finger in your face. "This loser is so reprehensible, his partner was driven into the arms of another man. I didn't mess up his garbage life, I just showed this mouth-breathing troglodyte to the world! This is journalism! Uphold our creative rights; don't silence our speech or bind us in safety regulations." Turning on a recording of people chanting his name, he exits.

3. "Shows like [i]The @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ Show[/i] exploit emotionally vulnerable members of society," muses clinical psychologist Dr. W. Ordy, best known for the critical thesis on untrained media personalities, [i]Pop Psychologists: Stating the Bleeding Obvious and Getting Paid[/i]. "They have little interest in protecting the people who participate, often haranguing them until they take part, employing cheap shock tactics. Reality shows must be obliged to ensure all participants are mentally fit and supported by trained psychological professionals, and provide full aftercare."

4. "Participants on those shows beg for ridicule," snorts your brother. "Oh, my partner doesn't love me. Oh, I don't like my haircut. Oh, dear, I'm dying. Wah-wah! But, picture this: [i]@@LEADER@@'s Court[/i]! A new talk show, starring us, and forcing whoever we want to humiliate to feature as victims. You would expose and arbitrate their worthless lives, and whoever we didn't like would be ridiculed. Say someone once said something bad about you?

A long-lost treaty with the aboriginal population of @@NAME@@ has been recently and conveniently uncovered, guaranteeing the right to settle legal cases by the traditional means of Thumb War. Documents in hand, Elder @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ 'Finger Crusher' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ is seeking to settle a longstanding real estate ownership dispute with a frail and arthritic CEO in the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ industry.

The Debate
1. "For too long, my people have been denied our rights to this valuable land, and the economic power it brings," @@HE_1@@ roars, working an enormous exercise band with @@HIS_1@@ equally enormous thumbs. "You must respect our rights, and prove that your government is honorable. Tell you what, rather than deciding government policy with debates and chatter, why don't you stick out that puny thumb of yours, @@LEADER@@, and let's get this over with.

2. "Now hold on a moment!" interjects General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of an eccentric military research branch. "We shouldn't thumb our nose at this treaty, but see how it doesn't specify who they face off against? My office has been secretly developing a mechanical exo-suit, and it's time to field test our new Mega Glove! I bet one of our soldiers would make a great champion!"

3. "Who's got two thumbs and a money making idea? This guy!" enthuses television executive @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, pointing at himself. "Instead of tying up the real courts with this sort of thing, let me make a legally-binding reality-sports-procedural show out of it! Think of the viewing numbers! Everybody will tune in to see if the plucky bar-room thumb wrestler can train enough to overcome the mighty hands of big business lawyers over the course of a season... no, two seasons! Oh, the montages we'll have!"

4. "Whoever wrote this must have been all thumbs... I don't think our government can really be held accountable for it," weasels your Minister of Exceptions. "It's so badly written, I practically need a translator to read it! Just tie it up in court with endless challenges to what each word means — I'm sure it'll get thrown out eventually."

[b][anchor=1235]#1235[/anchor]: Good Guy With a Gun [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
A gunman took to the mall and shot dead three people before a nearby coffee shop waitress dispatched him with five rounds from her automatic pistol. Unfortunately, as she stood over him gun in hand, a mall security guard thought she was the threat and took her out with his submachine gun. He in turn was shot by a libertarian who thought the state was finally coming to take his gun away. By the time the police arrived (and gunned down more would-be heroes who they had mistaken for terrorists), the death toll had reached fifty-seven.

The Debate
1. "Personally, I call that a win," exalts @@CAPITAL@@ Rifle and Revolver Association representative @@RANDOM_NAME@@, firing a round into the air in celebration. "I mean, how many people would the initial gunman have killed if nobody had stopped him? More than fifty-seven, that's for sure. More guns equals more safety. Maybe the government ought to recognise that by picking up half the cost of every gun purchased. Oh, and uh... thoughts and prayers to the families of the deceased and all that, yada yada."

2. "Hell, yeah!" agrees Sheriff @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spinning and holstering @@HIS@@ sidearm, and accidentally discharging a round into the floorboards. "Though, y'know, maybe more gun discipline would help. People who use guns should be forced to attend training seminars run by responsible and well-paid local sheriffs. That'll help them to learn target discrimination, gun safety and all that. And... uh... yes... what a tragedy... our hearts go out to the bereaved."

3. "Let's face it, the problem here wasn't the shooting — it was the powerful weapons being used," asserts one of the victims, rubbing @@HIS@@ injured derrière. "I mean, if the gal who shot me hadn't been on full auto, she would never have accidentally zinged me. If we just restrict selective-fire weapons, magazine extensions, and barrel shrouds, that should do it. Wholesome guns don't kill innocent people. Only assault weapons do that."

4. "Uh, we could try not letting people have these devices designed to murder and maim," ventures a long-haired hippy, insensitively disrespecting the dead by launching into yet another tirade of typical freedom-hating, commie, anti-gun ranting. It's possible @@HE@@ has more to say on this, but to be honest, no-one's listening.

A politician is attempting to have his name legally changed from Harry Butts to Honest Joe Johnson so it will look more appealing on the ballot, but his opponents are crying foul.

The Debate
1. "This is an obvious ploy to manipulate voters," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a candidate from an opposing party. "People shouldn't be allowed to change their names. It's too easy to abuse and all it does is confuse people."

2. "It's my name, and I should be able to change it to anything I want," Mr. Butts says with one of those plastic camera-ready smiles that politicians always seem to have. "I just want my name to reflect who I really am. As for the election, I'm sure the voters can be trusted to make the right decision."

3. "I'd trust that guy about as far as I can throw him," says transgender rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "He's obviously trying to game the system and you shouldn't allow it, but there are some people — like myself — who have legitimate reasons to change their names. You should let normal folk change their names, but force politicians to use the names that they were given when they were born."

4. "Hey, what if we took this a step further?" says @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ @@MOTTO@@ @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, one of your party's more creative campaign strategists and successful parliamentarians. "As we're listing names on the ballot, why don't we have all our party's candidates change their middle names just before the election to emphasise our key policies.

1. "This is a stupid law!" complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was interrogated by the police during the incident. "I was questioned for half an hour because I didn't have a polar bear! Where am I supposed to find a polar bear? I've done some reading up on these old laws: did you know that in the district of West @@CAPITAL@@ it's illegal for ladies to go out on Saturdays with a non-matching watch and handbag? These laws are foolish, and you should get rid of them."

2. "You can't be serious!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your secretary, who's wearing goggles because @@HE@@ is within 50 cubits of a fire hose, a law that applies only to the inside of Parliament. "We can't go around erasing all these half-witted laws — that would be way too much administrative work! We should just issue guidelines to our police officers, advising them to use their discretion about whether to enforce these laws."

3. "Excuse me, but you seem to be forgetting that these people broke the law," reminds goggleless Chief of Police @@RANDOM_NAME@@, taking care to stand 51 cubits from the fire hose. "I don't care how 'stupid' you think it is: the fact of the matter is that these people disobeyed the law! Sentence them as they would have been punished when these laws were written!"

[b][anchor=1238]#1238[/anchor]:  No Shoes, No Service [Sacara; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The rise of the Barefoot Wanderers, a newly formed religion, has led to an increasing number of people going about their daily lives without shoes or socks on. @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, famous movie star and new convert to the religion, recently made national headlines after @@HE@@ was forcibly removed from an uptown restaurant for @@HIS@@ lack of footwear.

The Debate
1. "This is discrimination in its dirtiest form, just like in my upcoming movie, [i]Faith Laid Bare[/i]," raves @@LASTNAME_1@@, pointedly resting @@HIS@@ dirt-caked feet on your desk. "It says in our most sacred texts that covering toes is giving service to the Sock-Devil. Being forced to wear such abominations is oppressing religious freedom! Besides, look at these toes, just look at them. Ain't they beautiful?" He wiggles them under your nose.

2. "Would you really want to dine in an establishment that smells of uncovered feet?" counters restaurateur @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ pan-fries a durian and Surströmming fritter. "We have a sign that clearly states our 'No Shoes, No Service' policy, and that is for the enjoyment of all the people that we serve. Businesses should be able to enjoy the right to refuse service to anyone they wish — they're our own restaurants, after all."

3. "Bl-euch! These foot-worshippers and toe-fetishists make me sick!" gags your Minister of Standards, adjusting @@HIS@@ pink-and-green three-piece suit and yellow suede brogues. "I say that allowing people to dress so sloppily is ruining the very fabric of @@NAME@@! You must demand that everyone should wear smart shoes at all times when in public. It's about professionalism and decency, don't you know?"

The Issue
Seven years ago @@RANDOM_NAME@@ went missing after a yachting accident, and has since been declared officially dead. However, @@HE@@ recently re-emerged and came back to @@NAME@@. Despite showing up in person to get @@HIS@@ death certificate reversed, @@HE@@ found @@HE@@ could not do so. @@HIS@@ mortician has come to complain to you on @@HIS@@ behalf, as corpses aren't allowed in the building.

The Debate
1. "It seems silly to me that my corpse... er, I mean patient, is still considered dead," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the mortician of @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, as @@HE@@ pushes a gurney with a covered and very life-like mannequin on it. "If somebody who has been declared dead shows up and gets an examination, the doctor should be able to change their legal status to living."

2. The mannequin suddenly sits up, revealing itself to be @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@, who was also declared legally dead after getting lost in the rain forests of Macronesia ten years ago. "Being dead isn't all bad, I suppose. There are no taxes, my family got an insurance pay-out... I guess it's kind of fun to be a 'zombie'! You should just let me stay legally dead. People like me, who officially 'don't exist', can't claim any government benefits, so you guys get to save some money too."

3. "I may have made a mistake, but after seven years it's reasonable to presume someone isn't coming back," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the registrar who made the death of @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ official. "Of course @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ is still alive and should be registered as such. Therefore, @@HIS_1@@ family should be made to return their insurance pay-out, and @@HIS_1@@ last will and testament needs to be scrutinized to see if they received any other benefits from @@HIS_1@@ death."

4. "You know, maybe @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@ is on to something," says your Minister of Necromancy, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Maybe we should create a task force of legally dead people to eliminate dissenters. We can deny their existence easily because they're all dead, and if anybody tries to blow the lid off it, they'll just sound like a crackpot who believes children's stories!"

5. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! ZOMBIE!" screams your young and excitable niece. "KILL IT, KILL IT, KILL IT, KILL IT, KILL IT, KILL IT, KILL IT, KILL IT!" Your sister comes in to try to calm the hysterical girl down, as she shouts over the screaming. "Seriously though, if the government says people are dead, they ought to ensure it."

The Issue
The theocratic nation of Sacerdia has long been embroiled in war with one of its neighbors, and recently that neighbor has forged a strategic alliance with Blackacre, a global superpower that your nation has always had somewhat unfriendly relations with. Fearful that this will tip the balance of power against them, Sacerdia is seeking an alliance with @@NAME@@, offering multiple favorable trade deals that would bring billions to the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ economy, and long-term access to its territory for the establishment of strategically-valuable @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ military bases. The nation's staunchly religious policies and culture, however, are a stark contrast to your nation's avowed secularism.

The Debate
1. "This is an offer we can't refuse!" exclaims your giddy Minister of Foreign Affairs. "Sure, the Sacerdians might be a little nutty in their religious beliefs, but the people they're fighting have promised to 'wipe @@NAME@@ off the map', or so their ambassador tells me. Not to mention that if Blackacre is expanding its influence in that region, we ought to as well! I think we can hold our noses and help them out even if it means compromising our beliefs just a little."

2. "We can work together, but only on a conditional basis," replies your Minister of Secularism, resting @@HIS@@ feet on a stack of Sacerdian holy books. "If they want our help, they need to start making some changes to their way of life. Tell them that the price of our assistance is transitioning to a secular government that respects the right to non-belief. Sacerdia is surrounded by other theocracies and fascist states, so we need to take this opportunity to instill our @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ and democratic values into the region."

3. "And you think that cesspool of a nation is going to abandon its deeply held delusions overnight?" scoffs one of your foreign policy advisers while rolling @@HIS@@ eyes. "We're talking about a nation that publicly executes anyone who speaks out against their religion! Their government is a lost cause — we should be helping out their people. Fund anti-theocratic dissidents, and create an underground railroad to help atheist Sacerdians escape their country. We have a moral responsibility to undermine religious tyranny."

[4]. "Bah! Who cares about some despotic hellhole in the middle of nowhere?" dismisses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the top commanders in the military. "Sacerdia and its equally noxious neighbour states lack nuclear weapons, so we can just blast the whole region back to the Stone Age with no risk of retaliation.

The Issue
Following the trial, conviction, and permanent deactivation of Kyle Hughman, notorious bit-serial killer and cyber-@@DEMONYM@@, Hughman has been sighted on the streets of @@CAPITAL@@ once again. Investigators soon learned of a peer-to-peer internet server that hosts cyber-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ backups to be restored upon news of the original's death. A panicked public is calling upon you to Shift+DEL the problem once and for all.

The Debate
1. "Cyber-@@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are innocent until proven guilty, like any other @@DEMONYM@@," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Justice. "But what does justice even mean if the duly convicted can escape punishment like this? I propose legislation that mandates that all artificial intelligence be converted to copy protected memory, in effect, making all AIs mortal. This will ensure that all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are equal in the end."

2. "This is outrageous! Why should law-abiding AIs be limited in this fashion?" retorts Jonathan 5, noted cyber-doppelganger. "That's right! Just think of all the economic and societal advantages our ability to instantly self-replicate provides!" adds Jonathan 6, from your office doorway. "Indeed, personal autonomy and reproduction are basic buccarian rights that everyone deserves — including AIs," adds Jonathan 8 from the water cooler. "And let's be clear here, while doppelgangers are copied from the same template, if the copy is made before a crime is committed, then that mind-state can't be held culpable for that crime," concludes Jonathan 314159x10^26 via your email inbox.

3. "The way I see it, a murderer has escaped justice through technological chicanery," complains Chief of Enforcement @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If someone commits a capital crime, then all of that individual's iterations should be deleted, no matter how long ago they were made. We can deploy some sort of hunter-killer algorithm and terminator robots to track down and delete copies of convicted felons. It might sound harsh, but deterrent-based punishments can only work if the penalty for crime is suitably severe."

4. "Why keep the death penalty at all?" asks Gloritron HALred, Cyber-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ rights attorney. "This incident just further illustrates the ineffectiveness of retributive justice. Far better and more effective approaches include cognitive behavioral debugging, for example. Violence originates in faulty programming, not faulty @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, and compassionate solutions should be the GOTO 10 of the day, for both electronic and organic offenders."

Free-runners and urban-climbers have taken to the internet to post photos of themselves performing gymnastic feats in ridiculously dangerous places, such as atop the highest spire of @@ANIMAL@@ Castle, or on skyscraper radio aerials hundreds of metres off the ground. Last week — while carrying out a rooftop backflip that he would have described as routine — one of them lost his footing and fell to his death.

The Debate
*1. "Kids are foolish and impressionable, and they'll do anything to get famous," lectures paternalistic security guard @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Give them warnings, and they just nod their heads, then come back the next evening. The only approach that will work here is zero tolerance: punish trespass into dangerous areas with a jail sentence." [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

*2. "Kids are foolish and impressionable, and they'll do anything to get famous," lectures Community Rehabilitation Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Give them warnings, and they just nod their heads, then come back the next evening. The only approach that will work here is extended therapy. Clearly, these look-at-me tendencies stem from being denied their mother's breasts during weaning, leaving deep psychological scars. We must fix these poor broken children!" [[color=blue]Must not have prisons[/color]]

3. "Anyone stupid enough to risk their life in this way is not going to be hard to outwit," suggests smug chemical engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I've recently made considerable advances in the fields of hyperallergenic anti-climb paints, near-frictionless surface coatings, and anti-trespasser automated tasers. Give me a budget, and I'll make your cities unclimbable."

4. "Hey, this is MY life, and MY choice!" says a voice from above you. You look up to see a teenager hanging upside-down from your chandelier. "You want to do something for urban climbers? Well, it's hard to concentrate on climbing while having to look over your shoulder for security guards. Make the outside of any building a public byway, and it'll be safer all round."

5. "So these kids do this because they want to be famous on the internet, right?" observes the inevitable technophobic nutter that always seems to turn up to these debates. "If you ban the internet, then no more problems, right?"

[b][anchor=1243]#1243[/anchor]: Kicking Back [Verdant Haven; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
A month-long investigation has revealed that an alarming number of judges across @@NAME@@ have been accepting kickbacks from private prisons in exchange for sending inmates their way. In many cases, the perpetrators would normally have been let off with a warning or a fine, but it appears they have been sent to prison strictly to line the pockets of the parties in question.

The Debate
1. "The problem is as clear as day — these judges are corrupt and must be punished!" roars the warden of @@INITIALS@@CI Inc., a private prison near @@CAPITAL@@. "As soon as private prisons like ours were introduced, they came sniffing around demanding payouts, and threatening to bankrupt us if we didn't play ball. We're the real victims here! Get rid of the bad judges, and I promise things will go much more smoothly."

2. "The problem is as clear as day — these private prison companies are corrupt and must be shut down!" hollers Judge @@RANDOM_NAME@@, banging @@HIS@@ gavel authoritatively. "As soon as private prisons were authorized, they came around with envelopes full of money, slipping bribes everywhere they could, trying to corrupt the course of justice! I saw many of my colleagues tempted by that cash, and I suspect some of them gave in... but not me, of course."

3. "The only reason this happens in the first place is because judges can control where a convict is sent!" declares @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ D. Umbledore, your Undersecretary of Unpredictability. "We need to randomize this process. Place the names of all the prisons in @@NAME@@ into a sorting hat, and have each convict draw one when sentenced. Whatever they draw — that's where they go.

After their successful moon landing, Dàguó astronauts have removed your nation's flag from the satellite's rocky surface and replaced it with their own.

The Debate
1. "Damn Dàguó doofuses, dropping in where they're not wanted!" complains border control officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, attempting to find the landing site through a small telescope. "Give us the say-so and we'll put out a warrant for these vandals! If Dàguó doesn't extradite them, we'll just have to prosecute them in absentia."

2. "How can you expect one lonely flag to survive undefended?" wonders astronaut @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We need a more permanent base on the moon to keep these Dàguó latecomers out. All it'll take is a few @@CURRANCYPLURAL@@, lots of oxygen, and an electric fence."

[3]. "Do you realize how much that would cost the taxpayer?" panics business executive @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ props @@HIS@@ feet up on your desk. "Subsidize private businesses to further refine space weaponry, and we can deliver a much more efficient approach. A missile or two should remove the pesky Dàguó flag." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

4. "H-h-hold on, @@LEADER@@," stutters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Cowardice. "Don't we have more than enough problems to handle on our own planet? You should publicly congratulate Dàguó on their technological breakthroughs, and politely ask their ambassador for the flag back."

The Issue
A school in the tiny village of Piddleton, that lies in a sparsely populated and mountainous district of @@NAME@@, has just enrolled twenty-four sheep from a nearby farm as students. The inability to fill the student number quotas mandated by the Local Authority — that help to keep schools financially viable — would have otherwise meant the closure of the school.

The Debate
1. "What other choice did I have?" bemoans School Headteacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ points out the village of Piddleton on a map to alleviate everyone's curiosity. "This is the only school in Piddleton and it has served our community well for generations — the next nearest school is a two hour commute away. In a village of our size, these quotas are impossible to fill. You cannot allow local governments to impose these restrictions on any school, especially in rural districts."

2. "I've heard that in Ausblic they combine classes in rural communities, for example putting students from grade five and grade six together in one class," recalls Junior Education Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It will require a slightly looser attitude to national curricula and standardised teaching, but I'm sure we don't need to be too didactic. Although, in the case of this school in Piddleton, they might have to combine grades one to twelve."

3. "How much are we going to fork out for schools with only a handful of children in them?" complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, governor of the Locality Education Board, pocketing a one-@@CURRENCY@@ coin @@HE@@ has spotted on the floor. "If schools can not fill their student number quotas, then quite simply it is not economical to continue financing them. Close these schools down and the little tykes will have to get their education in the nearest town."

4. "Let's not be too hasty though," adds First Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who heads the devolved government of the district. "All you actually need to do is step back, and give more power to devolved governments to finance their own services. For example, it'd be very useful if we were able to control industrial, income and sales taxation in our devolved areas. Keep funds out of the hands of central government and put it in the hands of responsible devolved districts — we'll soon be able to fund Piddelton School, as well as other projects of local importance."

5. "These sheep are so cute and fluffy," coos second-grader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ presents you with a scarf made from @@HIS@@ classmate's hair. "I love studying with sheep, they help me to study better. Every classroom should have sheep in them, or goats, or cows."

Scientists have successfully revived the long-extinct feather-bellied @@ANIMAL@@ to the point where a population of the creatures can be sustained in the wild. The nation's leading wildlife experts and @@ANIMAL@@ enthusiasts have offered their suggestions on how @@NAME@@ should handle these animals.

The Debate
1. "We can't upset the balance of nature!" proclaims Mipha @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, Chief Veterinarian at a national park in @@NAME@@, while feeding the fish in your office. "These animals haven't been around for more than a hundred years. Who knows how they'll react to their new surroundings? It could cause a total shift in the food-chain and the entire ecosystem. We should maintain their population in controlled environments — like preserves, research centers and zoos."

[2]. "I know how to deal with this," states Revali @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, a renowned hunter, who deftly grabs one of the office fish and nails it to the wall. "If you're worried that too many of these animals would disrupt the ecosystem, then allow us hunters to take care of the problem. It would be a phenomenal experience to track down creatures that nobody has seen in generations and tourists would flock to @@NAME@@for the thrill of the hunt. All in the name of the balance of nature, of course!" [[color=blue]Hunting @@ANIMAL@@ is legal[/color]]

3. "Instead of tampering with nature, why not just let it be?" proposes Daruk @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, an animal rights activist. "We have proved that we have the power to bring these species back to life, but now they need to be left alone in peace. Release these animals into the wild and let Mother Nature take her course. Be a friend of the environment, not the master of it."

[4]. "These animals should be used for the benefit of all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@," asserts farmer Urbosa @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, as he herds a flock of sheep around your office. "What a waste it would be to release them into the wild — they belong on farms! Imagine all that they could do for us, and the gourmet foods that we could make with their juicy, succulent meat!"

The Issue
A patient accused Ward Nurse @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ of an inappropriately intimate physical examination, which resulted in his suspension from duty at @@NAME@@ Central Hospital. A series of investigations and legal meetings followed, involving hospital management, the patient ombudsman, the complaints review board, and eventually a magistrate's court of appeal. All in all, the nurse was suspended for a total of nine months before the complaint was dismissed and he was fully exonerated.

The Debate
1. "There's no protection for the reputation of professionals anymore," rants the accused nurse, waving a loaded syringe around as he speaks, spraying an unknown sticky white fluid in your face. "My name was in the local paper! The girl I was dating dumped me! Look, of course we must allow complaints. However, once a complaint has been dismissed, we should be able to take false accusers to court to hold them to account. I want compensation for my losses, one way or another." He leers disturbingly with this last statement.

2. "Why doesn't anyone believe me?" sobs @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the complainant who levelled the allegations, as she surreptitiously peels an onion under the table. "For the sake of victims everywhere, you have to weigh in to protect people like me. Do you know how scary it was for me to come forward with this? You owe it to patient safety to trust the word of victims, and to permanently suspend perverts like this nurse!"

3. "As far as I can see, this whole problem has happened because it's one person's word against another," observes your Minister of Watching Watchmen. "We ought to enforce some transparency to medical proceedings, with every professional accompanied by a trained observer for all interactions, and each patient also encouraged to bring their own chaperone. That way, there'll always be at least one impartial observer to verify witness accounts."

Last week, your aides scheduled a meeting between you and a renowned former states@@MAN@@ of @@NAME@@. Unfortunately, due to @@HIS@@ long-standing battle with Alzheimer's disease, the meeting left something to be desired, bringing the once-forgotten issue of dementia treatment in @@NAME@@ back into the spotlight.

The Debate
1. @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, the states@@MAN@@ with whom you met, expresses @@HIS@@ concerns to a nearby aide, whom @@HE@@ appears to have mistaken as being in charge. "Once upon a time, I would have been running this @@TYPE@@, but now I'm... I'm... What was I saying? Oh yes: Some folk like me might need day centres, and help round the house. I'm fine, but what I wouldn't mind is more attractive nurses like that cutie over there." @@HE@@ winks in your direction.

2. As @@HE@@ leaves, the aide @@HE@@ was talking to rolls @@HIS@@ eyes. "Surely it can't fall to @@NAME@@ to give people like @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@ handouts. If these old farts haven't planned for inevitable cognitive decline, that's their fault. Cut all aged care funding, and if people can't manage — well then, I guess it's just too bad."

3. "Hang on, hang on. Whatever happened to having a caring family?" interjects your aunt, who is herself advancing in years. "When I was young, we used to care for our parents through thick and thin! This country needs more reinforcement of the traditional family values, which means the young loving and caring for their elders. We should make the elderly legal dependants on their children, to make them pay their parents back for raising them."

4. "Y'know, there's another solution to this problem," whispers your ever-present Minister for Creative Solutions, sharpening a straight razor on a whetstone. "These people aren't contributing to our economy, so why don't we make a few government cuts, if you know what I mean." @@HE@@ waves the blade menacingly.

Unfortunately, the individual making the needed cuts made a botch job of it, lopping off a bit of flesh and giving @@LASTNAME_1@@ a nasty infection. The celebrity is now using his influence to call into question safety standards around circumcisions.

The Debate
1. "Praise be, I don't regret seeking circumcision," winces @@LASTNAME_1@@, fresh from the set of his latest movie [i]Cut to the Point[/i]. "However, I mistakenly assumed that a priest offering circumcision would have some sort of professional qualifications.

2. "Look, it was a tricky procedure on a difficult individual. Anyone could have misplaced their cut," grumbles circumcisionist Britt Miller, gesticulating forcefully while holding a pair of scissors. "There wasn't much size difference from the infants I normally work with, though babies wail and wriggle a lot less.

The Issue
Seemingly with nothing better to do with their time, the Ministry of Statistics has conducted a study profiling the most prolific @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ serial killers and murderers. They have determined that the vast majority of the perpetrators tend to be sexually frustrated single men.

The Debate
1. "The problem is that these unfortunate men are being denied entry into the sexual marketplace," posits controversial University of @@CAPITAL@@ professor Peter Jordanson while stroking his goatee. "Women are humiliating these men with constant rejection. Is it any wonder that they snap? If you want to stop mass violence, we need to have government-arranged marriages and enforced monogamy, so that these men have loving wives who put out and take care of them. Do this, you'll surely see murder rates drop."

2. "You're surely not going to listen to this misogynistic drivel, are you?" scoffs renowned feminist speaker @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "It's not women who are the problem, it's men who think they are somehow owed sex! If you want this problem to go away, we need to start teaching our boys things like respect, consent, coping with rejection, and the inherent emotional immaturity of men. If men still can't see the problem, well, there's plenty of psychiatric institutions with available rooms."

3. "I think maybe our report isn't being taken as a whole," drones Ministry Statistician @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ in a dull monotone. "Correlations with lack of sexual satisfaction exist, but there's also low educational attainment, social isolation, childhood trauma, association with sexually deviant communities, lack of stable employment and the Hervey Cleckley 'Mask of Sanity' to consider.

I mean, sometimes, I get so frustrated about the lack of security in this lonely job. I know I should have studied harder, I just wanted to make mother proud but she always wanted more... always so much more..." @@HE@@ trails off and stares into space for a while.

[4].

The Issue
A local brewery provided the Mayor of @@ANIMAL@@ City with 120 free kegs of their famous ale: @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@'s Blood — usually a year's supply — as has been the tradition for many years. However, the current mayor has consumed the lot in just two months and taxpayers are now being asked to replenish the provision.

The Debate
1. "I know this makes me look like a drunk, but I assure you I'm not," pleads Mayor @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, as she touches her nose with her finger to prove her point. "I host a lot of diplomatic parties and my guests expect a certain level of hospitality. Just last week, I was hosting the Smalltopian ambassador and his entourage, and those Smalltopians can drink! You must replenish the mayoral supply — think of the diplomatic embarrassment of dry events."

2. "We have to pay for their booze now?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a social activist, who is always scrutinising politicians' expenses. "What if she drinks the whole lot in another two months? Will the suffering taxpayer have to continue to fund Her Worship's excesses? If politicians can't go five minutes without a drink, then they're not fit for office. Ban all alcohol on government premises."

*3. "Our @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@'s Blood is probably the finest brew in all of @@NAME@@," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Head Taster at the brewery, as @@HE@@ takes a sip from your drink, then spits it back into the cup. "It's a pity that only this mayor gets to taste our tantalising tipple, and for free too! We could supply your office @@LEADER@@, and even the whole of parliament. All we ask in return is that you could meet with some of the industry bosses occasionally and give us a favourable hearing." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "Our @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@'s Blood is probably the finest brew in all of @@NAME@@," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Commissar at the state-run brewery, as @@HE@@ opens a bottle of the ale with a sickle. "It's a pity that only this mayor gets to taste our tantalising tipple. We could supply your office, and even the whole of parliament. As a faithful cadre of your organisation, @@LEADER@@, in return, perhaps a senior position in the Party wouldn't go amiss?" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

The Issue
Top fertility clinics in the United Federation — an ultra-capitalist nation that you nonetheless have historically amicable relations with — have recently announced a new service allowing parents to create so-called 'designer babies'. This is something that is not currently offered by state-administered hospitals in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "I honestly don't see what the big deal is," says Ambassador @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, proudly showing you the ultrasound image of the designer pregnancy she purchased while posted to the United Federation. "I simply made sure that the little comrade will have the very best genetic make up that my partner and I could offer. That should be the right of every couple in our proud nation — boost the health budget so that everyone can choose to have the perfect baby!"

2. "This technology stands as a testament to the deep-seated moral corruption of the United Federation's ruling class," opines @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a senior member of the Party Committee on Ethics. "Notice how it effectively annihilates anyone who doesn't conform to the capitalist ideal of optimally profitable workers? And who are we to say that the discarded embryos do not deserve an equal opportunity to be born and to flourish? Embryonic screening should be outlawed, and anyone who travels abroad to undergo these procedures should be duly prosecuted.

3. "Optimal workers, you say?" inquires @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your minister of health. "That raises an intriguing idea: what if, rather than making genetic profiling freely available to all parents, we made it mandatory? Imagine, we could have a whole new generation of genetically-engineered workers that are ultra-productive and inclined to obedience to the state, with an enhanced ability to contribute to the greater good of @@NAME@@!"

"I ride the metro every day to go to work, and I'm constantly harassed by these noisy vendors! I have to yell down my phone so my clients are able to hear what I'm saying.

The Issue
Maggie Starkers — renowned multimillionaire, genius weapons designer and party-loving socialite — has always been somewhat eccentric and free-spirited. At a press conference this week, she revealed that she was the creator and pilot of a cutting edge flying exo-skeleton weapons system she calls 'the Iron Lady'. The military are keen to get their hands on this technology, but she doesn't want to share.

The Debate
1. It's mine and you can't have it!" asserts Ms. Starkers, taking a swig from a bottle of milk and standing proudly before a coiled-rattlesnake flag. "I built this near-indestructible nuclear-powered mobile firepower war machine, and I reserve the right to fly it around the city centre, blowing up criminals and people who I think are bad guys! You can't take away my stuff! I'll only sell it if I choose, when I choose and to who I choose, and frankly, I don't trust the state to be handling ordnance this powerful."

2. "Look, we need these weapons. If Maggie's not selling then we really don't have much choice," says Air Chief Marshal Uther Scargill. "Seize her designs, seize her assets, seize all her technology. She needs to be reminded that it's the people who are in charge, and that the needs of society are greater than the desires of the individual."

3. "Let's find a reasonable balance here," negotiates civil servant Mandy Rin. "Failing to respect private property is wrong, but Ms. Starkers still has to observe aviation regulations, munition control laws, trading restrictions and the like. I suggest you tie her up in bureaucracy until she agrees to strike a fair deal with us."

4. "Maybe there's a better way to make this work," suggests eye-patch wearing spy Jules Windu, walking in dramatically five minutes after you thought the meeting was over, during what your younger staff call the 'post credits debriefing'. "How about you let me build a special operative team — we'll call it the Vengeance Justice Initiative. The Iron Lady, Dogman, Superhulk, Ex-Husband-of-Colour and all the other special people with special talents... we'll call them to assemble when we need them, and let them get on with their lives the rest of the time. Oh, and I'll need a helicarrier. Don't ask why, just get me one."

It's election time in @@NAME@@, and the Treasury has allocated a measurable chunk of the budget to build a rapid transit line in the highly marginal seat of @@ANIMAL@@ City, much to the dismay of the residents and MPs of safer seats.

The Debate
1. "When are you going to provide some funding for us?" queries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Member of Parliament for the safe seat of Greenville. "Here are the plans for the ski-lift that was promised to be built in my town, but never was. Where did the funding go? To @@ANIMAL@@ City, again! To make things fair, every constituency should be allocated equal funding."

2. "We need that new metro," reminds @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@ANIMAL@@ City's MP. "How else will I... I mean, tourists get to the North Beach area? We're a tourist resort and tourism is important to the economy of @@NAME@@.

[b][anchor=1257]#1257[/anchor]: It's a Kind of Magic [Podium; ed: Altmer Dominion[/b]

The Issue
A shocking archaeological find in one of @@NAME@@'s many caverns has led to the discovery of a huge array of pre-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ totems, idols, and assorted knickknacks made entirely of stone, many of which gave researchers 'the heebie-jeebies'.

The Debate
1. "This is a fascinating opportunity for the scientific community as a whole!" spouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, breathlessly running through @@HIS@@ brick-thick pile of notes and results. "Our initial tests are already showing a stunning reading of anomalous energy in each and every one of those artifacts! If we could be permitted to, erm, [i]acquire[/i] them, this mysterious power source could be the backbone for future @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ technological advances! Think of the societal possibilities!"

2. Pushing the scientist aside, your mustachioed military adviser @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ grips at a manila envelope entitled 'TOP SECRET'. "That's all fine and dandy, but what if we used this 'anomllalus' energy to power our weapons? These days, everyone's raring to get bigger and better guns, and we need to make sure ours are bigger and better than everyone else's! If we get those magic rock thingies, I'm sure my eggheads'll make something out of it!"

3. "Hold on a moment!" shouts physicist @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Feinmann, frantically tying a leaded apron around @@HIS@@ waist. "Something feels off about this whole matter, and it's not a strictly metaphorical sensation. I'm not saying these totems are radioactive, but you'd have to be bongos-level bonkers not to consider it as a rational explanation. For the sake of everyone, please consider immediately transporting this archaeological cache to my laboratory upon excavation. Although careful precautions may slow down the pace of research, my team is one of only a few in the nation with the proper equipment to actually handle this matter safely."

4. Amid the din, museum curator @@RANDOM_NAME@@ squeezes into your office while clutching @@HIS@@ limited-edition copy of '[i]Ancient Civilisations for Dummies[/i]'. "I think we're all missing the point here! These are priceless artifacts, hearkening back to the days before @@NAME@@ was even around! If you don't have the maturity to leave them where they are, at the very least send them to my museum so other @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ can actually appreciate what came before them!"

[5]. A shallow bowl of apple purée smashes through the window, covering everyone in the room but you. Down on the street, a pious elderly individual paces furiously. "HERESY!

"We should grant them full citizenship and treat them like any other person; otherwise, they will still remain as slaves in their minds."

Your teenage niece was visibly upset this morning when she couldn't get tickets to see her favorite boy band in concert. As usual, the tickets were sold out within seconds of being offered, with the vast majority going to scalpers intending to resell the tickets at a marked-up price.

The Debate
1. "Whether it's tickets for a pop concert or the ballet, these scalpers are a menace to anyone who wants some good entertainment," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, host of popular consumers rights podcast [i]Scumbag Sellers[/i]. "Scalping needs to be banned. Tickets must only be sold by government-approved retailers and websites that adhere to strict regulations."

2. "Scalpers are just people who are trying to make a living, but why not ban the more unethical practices?" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Ministry of Compromises. "You could simply ban the bots and software that these scalpers use to snatch up tickets? That way you're still allowing some resale, but genuine customers aren't screwed over in the process."

3. "Blockchain is the solution!" claims one of your older ministers, who you suspect is parroting an opinion offered to @@HIM@@ by someone more tech-literate. "Blocks of chains on the internet build trust without a middleman, with uh... queued 'R' codes or something. All we need to do is give a budget to some tech start-up companies, buy them some crypt coins or something, and they'll solve the problem for us!"

4. "The problem is that people fail to understand basic economics," points out economics professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is known for @@HIS@@ condescending online lectures. "Haven't you heard of supply and demand? Scalpers only exist because the original sellers are foolishly under-pricing their goods: the market will self-adjust eventually, and the middlemen will be squeezed out.

1. "This is an absolute disgrace!" splutters LGBT activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, draping a giant rainbow version of the national flag around your shoulders. "That poor @@MAN_1@@ lost @@HIS_1@@ life because this cruel government refused @@HIM_1@@ sanctuary! What kind of nation will not give people refuge from cruel and despotic regimes?

2. "How was I meant to know @@HE_1@@ was telling the truth?" exclaims the immigration official who refused the @@MAN_1@@'s entry, distractedly adjusting the green carnation in @@HIS@@ lapel. "@@HE_1@@ could have been lying just so @@HE_1@@ could get into the country to take advantage of our generosity! How about we ask supposedly gay migrants to prove their sexuality? We could ask them questions that only a gay person would know, and only let people who pass into the country."

3. "You know, this raises the broader issue of immigration," announces your Finance Minister, dispensing financial projections with a little flourish. "We have an ageing population, so why worry about whether 'x' is cause for asylum but 'y' isn't? All suffering is equal, especially that of the public coffers. How about we loosen the immigration rules, rubber-stamping asylum applications from all people who arrive able and willing to live and work here."

4. "That this @@MAN_1@@ died is unfortunate, of course," drawls the famously understated author of [i]Do Stop Being Silly[/i], an analysis of brutal tyrants throughout the ages. "But we have a moral duty to care for our citizens, not every citizen of every country — no matter how unpleasant those countries may be. In fact, we ought to tighten the rules, so that only people with truly valuable skills can immigrate here."

Somewhat predictably, @@LASTNAME_1@@ is now outside the parliament building, ready to give it a go.

The Debate
1. "Look at @@HIM_1@@ strutting about, that know-it-all, trying to tell the public how my damn job should be done," snarls your extremely experienced Transport Minister. "What the hell does @@HE_1@@ know about fuel logistics, or network maintenance, or sub-contract management? Absolutely jack nothing, that's what! Broadcasters shouldn't be allowed to offer unfounded opinions about things they know nothing about. Slap a fine on her for misleading the public and fomenting ignorance — that'll teach @@HIM_1@@ to mind @@HIS_1@@ words."

2. "That's a little... extreme," cautions one of the minister's aides, serving up a tray of calming hot cocoas. "The truth is that a free media will always attract larger-than-life types to pontificate on whatever subject they want, and that's a great thing. Sure, maybe this radio host is clueless, but we should always encourage lively discussion on our airwaves. Maybe instead what we need is a more managed media presence, with ministers always consulting with their teams before making radio appearances.

The Debate
1. "This is the result of insufficient security checks," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Complicating Things. "If every signature across the nation required a counter-signature, forgery-resistant inks, a DNA test, family history checks, and an authenticity report produced by a staffer of my Ministry, I can ensure such forgeries would become a thing of the past!"

1. "The sheer nerve!" gasps disaster survivor and multimillionaire actor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is wearing nothing but an old potato sack to elicit sympathy. "After we've lost everything, these predators had the nerve to profit from human suffering? These price gougers didn't care how much they were hurting people, so the government must care.

2. "Fixing prices in place isn't enough," argues charity worker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pushing aside the disaster victim so @@HE@@ can take center stage. "Retailers can set whatever prices they want throughout the year, but during times of disaster they should be forced to discount basic necessities, for the sake of human kindness.

3. "If they don't like the free market, they shouldn't be living in @@NAME@@!" snaps Mega-Mart CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@, phoning in from @@HIS@@ beach condo in sunny Manamana.

"They're looking to receive special perks, such as separate cells and showering alone. We ought to take 'gender-identity' off our databases, and only record 'biological sex'. That's the only metric that matters in running efficient and safe prisons."

4. "Four times is probably an underestimate, as many transgender people may be afraid to reveal themselves," expresses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Equality, as @@HE@@ places the chairs in your office equidistant from each other, perhaps taking @@HIS@@ duties too literally. "It's not hard to suppose that we as a society are suffering from institutionalised transphobia, resulting in trans people being marginalised or over-convicted. We need society-wide education programs, to banish this bigotry. Then, maybe, we'll not see so many transgender people behind bars."

The Issue
At a recent event you attended, your security detail was suddenly roused to action by a spate of unknown transmissions loudly received on their ear pieces. After quickly ensuring your safety, guards soon traced the source back to an amateur radio club innocently setting up operations in a nearby lot.

The Debate
1. "Aren't ham radios great?" exclaims tweenaged club member @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Marconi, gleefully turning dials on some kind of base station. "With one of these, a person can talk to friends across town, or fellow enthusiasts all the way on the other side of @@REGION@@! You should make sure every kid in @@NAME@@ has the opportunity to learn about and use these radios! What better way to spread our nation's message than a free transmitter for every home, and total freedom of the airwaves?"

2. "I'm delighted to see so much interest in this technology!" remarks your Minister for Bureaucratizing Everything, writing down their remarks to file away later. "We should dedicate a certain segment of the nation's frequency spectrum for such enthusiasts! We just need some regulations to avoid conflicts like what occurred today— I know! Certifications! If an interested @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ can pass a government-mandated training program, we let them loose. I'll get to work on the requirements at once."

*3. "Frankly, @@LEADER@@, what happened just proves that the general public can't be trusted with their own transmissions," growls your lead bodyguard, looking up from a carefully-filled box score. "We need to keep the radio waves clear for security personnel, emergency dispatchers, and legitimate professional broadcasters for important things like the @@ANIMAL@@ball World Championship! If somebody has something to say, let them find work as a professional." [[color=blue]Sports are legal[/color]]

**5. "I've seen technology in other countries similar to a really upgraded version of the radio!" offers aspiring tech entrepreneur @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was fiddling with some electronics nearby. "Citizens can plug into devices called 'modems' so they don't occupy the airwaves.

The Debate
1. "We should mandate standards of hygiene and cleanliness in order to ride on mass transit vehicles," complains Cawdor Macbeth, your Minister of Transport, washing his hands at your personal sink. "Think of how many @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ were forced to share a carriage with @@HIM_1@@, or, heaven forbid, had to occupy the sweat-drenched seat @@HE_1@@ left behind @@HIM_1@@!"

When a celebrity power couple like pro-footballer @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ and fashion model and former pop starlet @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ marries, there's bound to be some glitz and glamour. In fact, thanks to @@FEMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@'s obsession with being a "fairytale princess" the beachside wedding also involved many tonnes of glitter, which is now drifting across the nearby lagoon, raising an important question — what about the mess?

The Debate
1. "Oh right, yah, the mess," notes the newlywed footballer, brushing pink and silver shimmering flakes off his lapel. "Yah, you should probably clean that up. We pay enough taxes already, so go do your job now. Here, go buy yourself something nice afterwards, yah?" He tosses his platinum credit card at you dismissively.

2. "You can't just buy your way out of an ecological disaster," complains dour-faced environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose scowling expression whilst photo-bombing has already ruined most of the wedding photos. "Microplastic fragments like this are detrimental to ocean life and can work their way up the food chain as well, causing damage to larger organisms. These irresponsible airhead celebrities should be prosecuted under the full weight of environmental law, and glitter must be banned!"

3. "C'mon mate, there's no need to suck all the colour out of the world," argues eucalyptus-grower @@RANDOM_NAME@@, tossing a handful of pink-and-gold flakes in your hair. "There's such a thing as biodegradable glitter you know. You don't even have to restrict the plastic stuff, you just need to give some shiny subsidies to the makers of cellulose-based glitter, enough so that they can keep their shelf prices competitive."

4. "Awww but the glitter is LUVVERLY," coos the blushing bride, her ultra-thin arms flapping as they catch a weak breeze. "We should make all the beaches and streets look all pretty and glittery, innit? It'd be so nice, and everyone would be smiling all the time because... because... AWWW I LOVE GLITTER, ME!"

You have since faced calls to not only fire Mr. Quagmire, but also to implement an exhaustive and accessible sex offenders registry.

The Debate
1. "A sex offenders registry is an absolute must," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Public Safety Minister, while giving Mr. Quagmire the evil eye. "It's a necessary tool to keep the public safe and aware of all the creeps that are out there. If we give a little more funding to our boys and girls in blue, we'll have it up in no time. Wouldn't it be great to see which of your neighbors is a pervert?"

2. "My whole life is ruined because of a dumb mistake thirty years ago!" wails Mr. Quagmire, as he glances up to check that you have noticed his tear. "We all make mistakes. It's not like I hurt anyone! People shouldn't be punished for a moment of teenage stupidity — what about my right to privacy?

*3. "As though anyone can't tell he's dangerous by those shifty eyes!" insinuates Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who likes to call police brutality 'enthusiastic questioning'. "Creating a sex offenders registry would be awfully time-consuming and tie up officers who should be out on the streets arresting those jaywalking scumbags.

Miraculously, the basic structure is intact and plans for rebuilding are already being made. A cadre of building experts have begun to occupy your office, throwing blueprints and sketches onto your desk.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@!" shouts an architect as @@HE@@ pushes through a wall of @@HIS@@ colleagues. "While no doubt this is a national tragedy, we have a chance to reinvent and renew that tired building to bring it into the modern age. None of this Gothic drab — sleek and modern is the way to go, reinforced with steel and glass. We can probably fit some office spaces into the spires, with a cafe at the entrance!

2. "The @@CAPITAL@@ Cathedral is a historical wonder and world heritage site!" shrieks a small @@MAN@@, clawing @@HIS@@ way through a sea of civil engineers. "Doing anything else than rebuilding this site exactly as it was, and as the original architects intended, is an insult to our heritage.

3. A terrified intern, who is being used as a battering ram by a gang of city planners, interjects: "I don't even know what's going on! Who cares about the stupid cathedral at this point? Can't the government just re-purpose the site into something we all would enjoy, like a theme park or amusement fair?

Decades ago, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ was one of the most powerful government ministers in the country. Now the old man has taken to publicly ranting against your regime, criticising everything from your economic policies to how it is your fault that neighborhood children are running on his lawn.

The Debate
1. "Well, it was nice of him to weigh in," shrugs cool young thing @@RANDOM_NAME@@, toying with the latest fashionable gadget. "We got to see how these geriatrics think. Clearly he's completely disconnected from all reality, and still fighting rivalries against politicians who've been dead for a decade or more! I say you go on national television and challenge him to a debate. I hear he's in the early stages of dementia, so it'll be pretty easy for you to make him look a fool, while making it clear that you're not afraid to hear criticism."

2. "I think it would be a mistake to entirely dismiss the sage advice of the elderly," cautions your octogenarian aunt, taking a break from criticising your 'too modern' hairstyle. "Your elders have many years of experience informing their decisions, and much of what they say is still very relevant. You ought to set up some kind of advisory board composed of former ministers and leaders like this gentleman, to guide you when you're in a pickle."

3. "Oh please, this should be easy," smiles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a party strategist. "He had something like half a century or so working in politics? There must be at least one action or statement somewhere in his record that will have aged poorly. Give the green light, and we'll dig up some dirt to bury his reputation."

The Issue
The Politics Department at the University of @@ANIMAL@@ City has come under criticism from opposition politicians because the programme is clearly and unashamedly biased in favour of you, @@LEADER@@, and your political ideologies.

The Debate
1. "This is immoral! The university faculty is so biased, they may as well just call themselves your official fan club," complains Opposition Leader @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, quickly hiding a dartboard bearing your face behind @@HIS_1@@ back. "Universities should have a balanced syllabus, not be indoctrinating young minds into some cult of personality. For the sake of democratic freedom, you must institute measures to ensure non-biased teaching in all universities, and political balance of opinion within teaching staff."

2. "This is not about partisanship; it is about academic autonomy," retorts Politics Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, signing a copy of @@HIS@@ latest book [i]Why @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@ Smells of Fish[/i]. "We, as a faculty, just so happen to choose to support your politics. And we just so happen to attract a capable staff who are all like-minded. It is our absolute democratic right to set our own syllabus, without interference from government! You, being one of the wisest leaders that this nation has ever seen, must surely see this!"

3. "I have to say, you're really popular with the politically enlightened @@ANIMAL@@ City graduates, and that can only help at the polling station," points out election campaign manager @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Maybe you'd have an even stronger majority if we named that university a 'flagship centre of education', and put them in charge of setting the national university-level political syllabus."

The Issue
Though religious belief was classified as a mental disorder, it has proven resistant to treatment, leading to the overcrowding of many mental institutions. In response, you have been invited to visit the @@CAPITAL@@ Lunatic Asylum.

The Debate
1. "I can't believe I'm saying this, but we [i]can[/i] try reasoning with these people," suggests nurse @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sighing over an illegible chart. "Of course, we need more facilities and staff to handle all the patients, but our current treatment methods aren't working. Let's dissuade these patients from their religious convictions through rigorous education in the sciences, presenting them with rational proofs against the existence of gods. Equipped with knowledge and trained in critical thinking, they will come to see the light."

2. "The zealots aren't changing their minds because we've been too soft on them," rasps the asylum's director, appearing from behind a corner. "The government should also allow us to use 'enhanced' conversion techniques, if you know what I mean. Also, we must have funding and permission to research and employ powerful drugs that will facilitate a change of faith. Our conversion therapies will surely work then!"

3. "There is a reason why we decided to put them in hospitals," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a fervent atheist clinician. "Religion has brought nothing but suffering to the world. Just look at all of history for proof! Faith may make us feel secure, but overall, it's just bad. You can't reform the devout, so help humanity by letting them meet their maker. We'll all be in paradise then."

4. "Let my people go!" shrieks a straitjacketed patient from within a padded cell. "I'm sure my deity would not want us to be supported by the @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ of my nonbelieving brethren.

For years, small towns along the nation's coast have been popular cruise ship destinations. However, with increasingly frequent visits by overwhelming numbers of passengers, one seaside town is attempting to ban all tourist vessels from stopping there.

The Debate
*1.

"My colleagues and I used to be able to make a decent living from harvesting the abundant resources of our coastal waters. But ever since these bilge-spewing behemoths started showing up, we've had to sail out farther and farther, and still can't catch more than a few minnows.

3. "Are you insane? Those tourists bring in tons of money," sputters restaurant owner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, drying a handful of utensils with a rag that looks dirtier than the floor. "I can charge these camera-toting cruisers five @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ for a glass of water, and twelve for a sandwich — and they'll happily pay it! The government should be encouraging tourism with an international advertising campaign."

4. "Businesses can't function without customers, but we need corporate responsibility from the cruise line operators. What if we just apply fines every time they violate our town's natural beauty?" suggests local police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, opening a new bag of plastic hand restraints labeled 'now 20% more circulation-restricting!' "Chemical pollution, constant noise, tourists urinating in the fountains — all of these abhorrent side effects can be curbed by giving local governments the power to issue punitive fines. Of course, you should also hold CEOs more directly accountable..." He twirls a pair of handcuffs with a grin on his face.

The Coastguard reported that following stormy weather a trio of small ships capsized in the @@ANIMAL@@ Strait. This resulted in the deaths of 78 illegal immigrants who were trying to enter @@NAME@@ under cover of darkness, including many children and two pregnant women.

The Debate
1. "It's our moral responsibility to stop people drowning in our waters," lectures Maritime Operations Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, respectfully removing @@HIS@@ cap. "You should deploy more coastguard vessels, linked to surveillance drones and a dedicated networked HQ. Give me an eye on every square metre of our seas, and no-one will drown again."

2. "Why don't we just lay out a welcome mat while we're at it?" complains Immigration Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, closing the office door to keep a draught out. "The danger of the journey acts as a deterrent, and that keeps illegal immigration numbers down. If anything, we should be reducing the coastguard, and concentrating solely on protecting fishermen, beach-users and marina businesses.

3. "It's because of our immigration laws that people are dying in the first place," muses your Minister for Extracartonic Cognition.

The Debate
1. "That was just trash talk!" yells the boxer, punching the wall angrily. "It's not like I actually wanted to kill @@HIM@@. You can't hold an athlete accountable for what happens in a sporting arena. Write that down. Make it a law." @@HE@@ waves a fist at you for emphasis.

2. "We all heard the threats, then watched the murder happen!" weeps @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, mother to the deceased boxer. "This was a premeditated act, a killer punch aimed in a way that he knew would be lethal! The law needs to recognise that threats are threats and crime is crime, no matter the sporting context."

The Issue
The newest edition of the nation's leading history textbook, [i]@@NAME@@: A Complete Record[/i], has generated serious controversy after critics noted the omission of an infamous massacre that nearly led to the extinction of an aboriginal @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ tribe.

The Debate
1. "The omission was a deliberate choice," declares CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of McBlah-Shill, the publisher who issues the textbook in question. "There is a serious lack of primary source information regarding the event, so anything we publish would rely heavily on unreliable secondhand accounts." Leaning in a little closer and speaking lower so only you can hear, @@HE@@ adds: "The fact is, schools are less inclined to invest in material that is both depressing and uncomfortable to talk about. It turns out that parents would prefer their children receive the most positive image of our country possible, and tend to complain otherwise."

2. "Take a wild guess why original documentation on this topic is so sparse!" exclaims indigenous @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ spits into your complimentary copy of the offending textbook before slamming it shut. "Your mainstream society has made every effort to conceal or destroy any evidence that might shed light on these atrocities, and with this latest incident you risk repeating the mistakes of the past. Please, @@LEADER@@, we mustn't whitewash the historical narrative. Regardless of how painful it may be, we owe it to ourselves and to the victims of this genocide — to my people — to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."

3. "So what if some dumb event got left out?" stammers your nephew, a straight-D student attending the prestigious Springtide High. "You can't expect a country's entire history to fit into a single textbook! Plus, with all the subjects we're required to learn already, it's any wonder we retain anything at all!

Officials from the tiny, allied nation of Prudenlund have requested that @@NAME@@ assist in a series of humanitarian aid airdrops to one of its distant territories. The target for the drops — a chain of sparsely-inhabited islands recently ravaged by storms — has been difficult for Prudenlundian authorities to reach, as their nation lacks sufficient transport assets.

The Debate
1. "We have everything ready to go, just nothing for all of it to go in," moans the Prudenlundian Ambassador to @@NAME@@. "The island chain is too distant for our smaller aircraft, and sea delivery will take too long. That's why we'd appreciate it if our friends in @@NAME@@ could spare a few military transport aircraft, and carry out the drops for us. We only really need the planes, but if @@NAME@@ would like to provide additional supplies to drop, soap or unwanted clothes or something, that'd be great too."

2. "Look man, I'd be down with sendin' a couple planes or somethin', but y'all Prudenlund people obviously haven't brought any gas money," says a young, brutally frugal official from the finance ministry's Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Excellence division. "And since y'all don't have gas money, it's gotta be a no on this whole airdrop thing. Ditto for all our other expensive and wasteful aid commitments elsewhere. Tell ya what though, I'll drop a line to the World Assembly or somethin', ask them to help out instead. Y'all got phone money?"

3. "Isn't that island chain famous for its coffee plantations?" muses your Minister for Agriculture. "You know, they're actually direct competitors in coffee exports, and the low strength of their currency is giving them a disproportionate market share. I suggest we deliver the aid, but contaminate the crates with fungus spores, to subtly sabotage their coffee production. We'll look like we're helping while covertly establishing a competitive advantage."

The Debate
1. "Of course we're grateful," begins @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Immigration Chief, as @@HE@@ slams the rule book on your desk. "However, illegal immigration is illegal immigration and we're a nation of laws. Despite his good deed, I'm afraid that we have no choice but to deport him.

"We should give this @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ fellow legal status and an official presentation at your office. One good deed deserves another, so make an exception for him. In fact, why don't you hand out medals at posh ceremonies for every caring citizen? The press coverage will do you wonders!"

3. "That brave man saved my daughter!" proclaims @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the girl's mother. "He absolutely must be given legal status.

3. "People should buy more local produce instead," suggests Onya Baike, from the eco-advocate organisation Carbon Counts. "We propose that you should tax cargo-carrying road vehicles increasing amounts proportional to the fuel used in transportation. I'm sure rising costs create rising prices, which will change consumer behaviour, which will mean less haulage traffic on the road, which means no parking problems."

4. "What if a parked truck didn't block the road?" muses 8-year-old @@RANDOM_NAME@@, playing with @@HIS@@ toy cars. "Trucks should have fold-out ramps at the front and back of their trucks so cars can safely drive over them when they're parked. Even if you've got lots of trucks parked back-to-back, you could link their ramps together and make a rooftop road!"

The Issue
Tensions within the Red Bloc reached new highs when the Premier of the People's Republic of Núi Và Sông snubbed you at a recent congress by taking the very last biscuit on the plate. The cause of this bolshy behaviour? Your nation's lukewarm support of Núi Và Sông's increasingly combative and provocative rhetoric towards the United Federation following a tit-for-tat trade war.

The Debate
1. "Get with the program, @@LEADER@@, these capitalist pig-dogs are our enemies!" bellows Premier @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Chi Minh, spraying biscuit crumbs everywhere. "So what if that Paper @@ANIMAL@@ possesses one of the largest nuclear arsenals known to man; they're nothing in the face of sanctions imposed by a unified Red Bloc. Are we spreading international socialism or are we having a tea party?"

2. "Listen to her go on," sighs ambassador @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of East Lebatuck, handing you a slice of baklava. "Look, the fact is the United Federation won't go down lightly. Don't bother with Núi Và Sông's rhetoric — instead, do what we did. Take a step back from pointless international confrontations, focus on developing socialism in your country and try to maintain economic solidarity solely among your allies. I'm not asking you to completely revise most of your founding ideology, but do consider whether it will be a safer option in the long run."

3. "If... if I may make a suggestion?" quavers ambassador @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of Skandilund, who has apparently wandered in by accident. "This whole Red Bloc thing is doing nothing more than creating a belligerent group of warmongers. If you're really interested in looking out for the working classes of the world, why not join us in our pact of nonaligned nations? We work with nations who are sick of getting pushed around by ideological power blocs. Sure, we might not be as cool as the bigger alliances — but we do have dress down Fridays!"

A minority population in South-West @@NAME@@, ardent followers of the Tranquility of Yellow, have proclaimed eight year old @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ as their new Great Advisor, regarded by Yellowites as the supreme spiritual authority. As followers prepare to pledge allegiance to the child, your inner circle worry that these people are too devoted to Yellowism and are undermining your authority.

The Debate
1. "These South-West @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ have always been troublesome," declares Head of Security @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ patrols the perimeter of your desk. "We should kidnap this @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ @@BOY_1@@ and keep @@HIM_1@@ hidden forever. We'll secure @@HIM_1@@ where no one will ever find @@HIM_1@@. Then, we install our own 'Great Advisor' — a @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ loyal only to the state. Force these Yellowites to follow our chosen child deity, and if they refuse — shoot them!"

2. "They certainly are troublesome," agrees General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, pushing your security chief out of the way with @@HIS@@ parade stick. "However, kidnapping a child seems a bit extreme, even for me! I suggest we incentivise a wave of devoted @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to move into the South-West region, until they dominate the region. The Yellowites may have their Great Advisor, but he will have to go to school with good @@DEMONYM@@ children and be taught our worldview from dedicated @@DEMONYM@@ teachers. Once @@HE_1@@ comes round to our way of life, the rest will follow."

3. "I sense an opportunity here," opines your Propaganda Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ trips up on the carpet, then glares at your interns. "Why don't we make @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ your official, ahem, Great Advisor? With @@HIM_1@@ advising you — and a large team stage managing every word that comes out of @@HIS_1@@ mouth — the Yellowites will have to follow your every command without question and their troublesome behaviour will be a thing of the past. Not only that, but if anything [i]ever[/i] goes wrong, we can blame it on the kid!"

4. "Can't you leave us alone?" sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the religious leader of the Yellowite people. "For centuries we have followed Yellowism and heeded our Great Advisor.

Cut us, and we bleed yellow... perhaps not literally, but you get the point. Loosen your grip on the South-West, and let our people be free to follow our conscience!"

5. "Hello? What about asking me what I want?" pouts @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@, throwing the toys @@HE_1@@'s been playing with the whole time. "I don't really want to be the Great Advisor, but my mum said I have to be. But it sounds so boring, listening to prayers and giving advice to old geezers.

The Issue
Upset with being grown in a lab to be used as weapons, a battalion of genetically enhanced super-soldiers have staged an uprising and taken over an important military base.

The Debate
1. "Whose stupid idea was this, anyway?" shouts the general who came up with the idea, marking a folder with an X on it with an even larger X. "The super-soldiers are strong, but they're completely worthless to us if they're not loyal to @@NAME@@. We need to go in with our full army, kill on sight, and if that doesn't work, we'll just bomb the crap out of them."

2. "No! Ze soldiers are too important to us!" protests Dr. Frankincense, who has just wheeled in a super-soldier strapped to a gurney. "Ve need to invade ze compound viz even more super soldiers! Super-duper soldiers! Ve vill breed zem for obedience and if zat does not vork zen ve can keep zem all under control viz mind-altering drugs! Allow me to demonstrate." He injects the soldier with a glowing substance, whereupon the soldier wakes up and breaks free from the straps. "It's ALIVE!"

3. "Now do you see why they don't like you very much?" asks the soldier, calmly climbing down from the gurney to the shock of the doctor, who taps his syringe in bewilderment. "They'll settle down if you treat them better. We should be treated like normal soldiers, complete with a paycheck, vacation time, and a chance to eventually retire. Maybe you could assign us some easier missions too. We super-soldiers are people, just like you — only betterer.... RERRR?" The soldier's argument trails off as the drugs begin to take effect.

4. "Bah! Who needs 'em?" scoffs libertarian and suspected secessionist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, looking at the super-soldier in disgust. "They think they're so tough? They want to have their cake and eat it too — all the rights and none of the responsibility. Well, fine!

[b][anchor=1286]#1286[/anchor]: Burning Over a New Leaf [Palos Heights; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Many @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ have long equated the autumn with colder temperatures, apple bobbing, pumpkin spice, and the aromatic tradition of burning fallen leaves to avoid doing yard work. Although the smoky scents of burning foliage are soothing to some, an uptick in the number of domestic fires caused by immolating leaf piles has lead to a growing call to ban the hallowed practice.

The Debate
1. "This year alone, @@NAME@@ has spent an exorbitant amount of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ on fire damage caused by burning leaves," states Minister of Disasters, Bonnie Fyre. "We need to make it illegal for unlicensed persons to burn plant matter outside, to curtail these outrageous costs! I hate yard work as much as anyone, but I think we can all agree that having homes to live in is more important than a little added inconvenience."

2. "Not burning leaves during the fall is about the most un-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ thing I can think of!" exclaims acclaimed singer-songwriter George Morris Jr. "When people think of autumn in @@NAME@@, they think of romance under the moonlit skies, as all the leaves on the trees are falling with the smoky scent carried on the breezes that blow! @@LEADER@@, I'm begging you — calling on your heartstrings that play soft and low — please don't ban this fine @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ tradition."

3. A bell rings and a man peddles through your door on a three-wheeled trike. "Greetings @@LEADER@@, my name is Si Call and I'm a biofuel man. I hear you're in a tight spot with this leaf business. Now, I'm in the business of sustainability, a business that relies on biomass such as your leaves. You see, only the freshest of leaves will do — the old leaves have too much lignin which makes it hard to extract the sugars. The only thing preventing us from plucking the freshest leaves in @@NAME@@ is that we don't own the land the leaves fall on. If you were to allow us to bypass those silly restrictions, why, we could just suck those leaves up the second they hit the ground! What do you say?"

4. "@@LEADER@@, you can't possibly be thinking of getting rid of these leaves. Are you?" questions your Minister of New-Growth Forests, Connie Fuhr. "We cannot underestimate the ecological importance dead leaves play in replenishing the nutrients in our soil! Ban burning leaves, but fine anyone who even thinks about doing yard work to get rid of those leaves!"

5. "Jeez, this all sounds like so much work," groans the boyfriend of your fourth cousin, thrice-removed, Vinnie 'Fun' Guy, who gives his occupation as 'waste management'. "These leaves causing problems? Why not just take out the source? Cut down a few trees, bada-bing bada-boom, no more leaves sticking their veins where they ain't wanted, causing honest folks to start fires. I know a guy who owes me. We'll take care of this problem for ya. Want us to make it look like an accident?"

The Debate
1. "The youth of @@NAME@@ feel disenfranchised from the institutions that make the decisions that affect their lives," begins a young girl, who is immediately interrupted by one of her classmates. "We propose that @@NAME@@ establish a youth parliament, with the power to submit bills for the consideration of the national parliament. This will ensure equal representation as well as a voice for today's youth."

2. "Bravo! These students represent the best and the brightest of our nation, and they're just so cute too!" says @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, your Minister of Education as @@HE@@ wipes a tear from @@HIS@@ eye. "However, these are their formative years, and they should be spent honing their intelligent little brains, not making potentially binding decisions for our nation. Instead, why not have schools appoint their own student governments? We'll give the education budget a little boost to help in their creation."

3. "Indeed, these fine youngsters are the pride of our nation," begins @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of the Interior, as @@LASTNAME_1@@ shoos the student delegates out. "But, not all of our youth are as eloquent and informed as those two delegates. I for one, am particularly wary of these so-called 'young adults' who have the power to influence the direction our country goes in at such a wee age! I urge you to raise the voting age by five years."

4. "None of you really seem to appreciate the beauty of what we just witnessed," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Child Welfare. "The organization, the effort, and the care of those students coming together with a focused and compassionate vision of equality for our nation. It has me thinking... why not permanently appoint some children to your cabinet? Let's give, say, a third of all positions to under-18s. Who is more sensitive, considerate, and goal-driven than they are? Certainly not our ineffectual, and frankly myopic parliament."

In the last few years, cutting edge neurosurgical centers have been using electronic implants to help patients regain brain function that has been lost due to head trauma or neurodegenerative diseases. Many of these individuals rely on implants for a large proportion of their cognitive function. Unfortunately, the recent abolition of AI citizenship has left these patients in a legal gray area.

"If these 'people' are controlled by computer chips, then they're AIs and they're not entitled to any special rights just because they have some human organs."

The Debate
1. "He had no right!" cries Miss @@LASTNAME_1@@, tearing leaflets on PMS into little strips. "Pharmacists don't know why my doctor prescribed this medication. I have been crippled by my cycle for years, and if that man had had to suffer like me, he wouldn't have wanted a lecture — he'd have wanted a bloody medal! @@LASTNAME_1@@ knew he was taking on a role that would require dispensing the Pill.

2. "I cannot — in good conscience — provide the means for consequence-free intercourse," drawls @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_2@@, shoving his Master's in pharmacy under your nose. "However, I did suggest non-medical alternatives for her professed condition and provided the address of a willing pharmacist, not thirty miles away, when the lady was... unenthusiastic.

The Issue
On a tight schedule, you're walking from one meeting to another in a building a block away. Just as you reach the intersection you notice quite the commotion as an oncoming car slams into a red-faced @@ANIMAL@@ on the other side of the street.

The Debate
1. "What a coincidence, this is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about," says ecology professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while discreetly sliding an empty animal cage out of view. "Habitat fragmentation, the process of the built environment splitting large areas of habitat into smaller pieces, is a blight that is checkering @@NAME@@. When roads are put through habitats, the native animal populations become disjointed and less resilient. You can lose the red-faced @@ANIMAL@@ in one of these fragments without noticing, but before long, it's disappeared from 20 or 30 fragments, and become an endangered species. You need to establish wildlife corridors and animal crossings linking green spaces across @@NAME@@."

2. As you rush to the other side of the road to make the meeting, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, host of Animal World, pops out of the bushes in the median. "Our cities have expanded too much. Our entire population could fit in an area half the size of @@CAPITAL@@. If we decreased our urban footprint, the problem would solve itself without having to build a bunch of bridges! Now, I'm sure not everyone will enjoy giving up their suburban McMansions for more modest city apartments, but I think when they see those little red-faced @@ANIMAL@@s thriving it will turn their frowns upside down."

3. "Both of those solutions seem a bit extreme," yells real estate developer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from @@HIS@@ SUV over the din of frustrated motorists now honking at you for blocking the road. "The red-faced @@ANIMAL@@ is doing fine, this whole thing is unnecessary environmental panic. Real estate in @@NAME@@ is at a premium already, let's reduce barriers to development in existing parks and green spaces!

Suddenly, you hear some sleigh bells jingling and ring-ting-tingling outside: a band of merry Maxxmas carollers!

The Debate
1. As the urchins polish off '[i]O, Little Town of @@CAPITAL@@[/i]', the diminutive leader of the group hobbles forward on a crutch. "Beggin' yer leadership's pardon, but may I say I feels so gratified to see you an' yours all together.

[[color=red]Alcohol is illegal[/color]]

5. "I'll tell you what Maxxmas is for," laughs your brother, seizing the urchins' donation tin and bolting the door. "Presents piled ten stories high, all with my name on them! Diamond-studded watches, cashmere suits, even a private helicopter! The one reason Maxxmas exists is to teach people that only present-buying is a true expression of love — an advertising campaign to remind them will get everyone shopping."

**6. "Talk about greed!" scoffs your uncle, who is currently hoarding a whole turkey for himself. "You don't need presents; Maxxmas is all about the big family dinner.

Hoping to patch things over, a formal head of state visit has been arranged. On the itinerary is an open-top ride through their national park in a traditional moose-drawn carriage. However, security staff have expressed some concerns about this.

1. "Have you heard of the Sons of the Maple?" asks your security chief, nervously checking behind your desk for hidden assassins. "They're hard-line Brancalanders who haven't forgiven Syrupgate and they've promised to throw a bucket of syrup over your head. Look, someone as important as you is always going to have enemies, and security is paramount. You should travel only in our own armoured vehicles, and have your safety provided only by our own security services. It's a dangerous world — you have to be pragmatic."

2. "According to the World Census, Brancaland is in the top 5% safest nations in the world," reassures your Minister for Diplomacy, who is known to be quite ambitious. "You're as safe within their borders as you are within your own front room. We should show some trust in Brancalandian security arrangements.

3. "When are you going to learn there's no place that's as safe as home?" queries your Minister of Domestic Affairs. "Besides, we've got problems enough here for you to deal with.

@@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a usually unremarkable 45-year-old sanitation worker, was recently detained after trying to tight-rope walk naked across the canyon between two financial district skyscrapers. It turns out this was for a bet, or more accurately as the price of a wager in an illegal "extreme casino", where gamblers are allowed and encouraged to offer non-financial stakes. In these places any wager can be agreed, be it body parts, sexual favours or binding agreements.

The Debate
1. "I'm a man of integrity; I had to honour the agreed stakes," enthuses the gambler, shivering in a police cell and seemingly showing no contrition for his foolishness. "Honestly, you need to allow this sort of thing in legal casinos. It's a real thrill, knowing that the next turn of the card could win you thousands, or could literally cost you your balls."

2. "This poor idiot is a victim, both of his own gambling addiction and of the criminal subculture that abuses that dependence to manipulate the weak-minded," lectures Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ posts a notice banning @@HIS@@ officers from buying lottery scratchcards. "We need more police officers to crack down on illegal casinos, mental health support to help deal with gambling addiction, and social workers to help deal with the root causes of gambling.

3. "You don't have to go to either extreme," says casino owner @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Rather, there's a market-based solution here.

The Debate
1. "You can only incriminate yourself if you've done something wrong!" gruffly remarks prosecutor Jason 'Obese Man' McCabe, dragging his pet bulldog behind him. "If a witness is called to testify, they are obliged to do so, and to tell the whole truth no matter where that truth takes them.

"The privilege against self-incrimination should be one of the most fundamental rights under the @@DEMONYM@@ justice system and must not be abrogated under any circumstances."

3. "Who let these dogs out?" gravely asks Justice Bahamen, motioning for the court bailiffs to remove the offending animals.

The Issue
Previously untouchable mob boss Buff Tony was recently arrested and charged with numerous offences including extortion, racketeering, and money laundering. Public interest is considerable, and the media are asking to be allowed to televise the proceedings.

The Debate
1. "Buff Tony is rumoured to have a long arm, and there are legitimate concerns that the trial will be corrupted," argues television producer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The judiciary is only just when it is held accountable by the people, but it's impractical for the wider public to attend court in person. The media is a powerful conduit to the public and should be allowed to film in court to promote fairness and transparency in the judicial system."

2. "Allowing the media to film in court will be making a circus out of a serious process," counters courtroom sketch artist @@RADOMNAME@@, as @@HE@@ puts the finishing touches to an unflattering caricature of you. "The parties will inevitably be grandstanding to the TV cameras instead of making a proper case. While I agree that it is in the public interest to allow @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ to witness and report on court proceedings, filming devices should not be permitted in court."

3. "And what about my client's right to privacy?" asks the lawyer for Buff Tony, surreptitiously sliding a bulging envelope towards you. "Being on trial is distressing enough and shouldn't be compounded by parasitic journalists publicizing intimate or embarassing details about a defendant. For the sake of decency, the public shouldn't be allowed to witness, let alone report on, court proceedings."

4. "Objection!" yells celebrity attorney Fenix Rong, without making it clear what he is objecting to, but striking a heroic pointing pose as he does so. "Trials should not only be televised, they should be entertaining! Surprise witnesses! Last minute evidence! Shouting at criminals till they break down! That's what people want to see. Objection, I say, objection!"

On the night before Maxxmas, and the day of as well, national headlines had a story to tell. Between North and South Palisade, the endless war grew dire, but — for a couple of days — the two sides ceased fire. On the land that a mere day ago had been shelled, a jolly game of football was held, but as your army had joined in the merriment, it became quite an issue for your national parliament.

The Debate
1. "How could they do this? What could this mean?" your Minister of War shouts and screams. "The thought of our soldiers getting along with North Palisade! This was their opportunity to launch a foray! Forget about the reason, this is an act of treason, and war is a battle that should be fought, not played. Our national pride is now at stake, and letting this slide would be a mistake. The consequence for befriending a rival: a homecoming soldier should be arrested 'pon arrival. Let it be declared — from coast to coast — fraternising with foes is what we hate most."

2. "But Maxxmas is the most wonderful time of the year," cries General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, shedding a tear. "Our soldiers fight day and night without rest, killing people and living in fear and distress. The sacred tradition of [i]peace amongst all[/i] is something that unites nations, both great and small. Forget about the victory we could have had if we fought. It'd be best if every Maxxmas we ceased fire on the spot!"

3. "Maxxmas is a stupid holiday with an equally stupid tradition." You look up in dismay to find the infamous Krampus S. Grinchen. "[i]Give a gift[/i] this and [i]peace on Earth[/i] that! I could pick better names than [i]Maxxmas[/i] out of a hat!" He finally mutters after a ghastly tirade, "Banning it would be the first decent decision you've ever made."

[b][anchor=1297]#1297[/anchor]: What Are You Hiding in Your Genes? [Daarwyrth; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
With DNA tests from My23AncestralHeritages becoming increasingly popular across the globe, many @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ have sent their saliva to complete strangers in a lab to find out their genetic ancestry. Yesterday, as part of her longstanding diatribe against @@NAME@@, the Supreme Leader of Blackacre posted on her Twitcher account that your Minister of Justice is related to one of your nation's most dangerous criminals.

The Debate
1. "I assure you, I had no idea this criminal was my grandmother's brother's second wife's sister's son's grandchild!" the Minister of Justice announces. "I mean sure, he seemed familiar when I granted him that request for leniency, and a cellphone, and a plasma TV... but that's beside the point. The privacy of millions of our citizens is in danger! Greedy companies like this one will sell sensitive information such as DNA profiles to anyone who pays the right price, like those no-good slime-balls from Blackacre. For the good of our people — and my family's remaining secrets — you need to regulate DNA tests and ensure that individuals' information stays in safe hands!"

2. "Now, now, let's not do anything too hasty," tuts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of My23AncestralHeritages. "My company provides legitimate goods and services to legitimate customers, be they @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ or men in black suits and dark sunglasses explicitly claiming not to be from Blackacre. Information is a commodity too, so why not sell it? Relax some of those draconian privacy laws of yours and give the economy a big boost by opening up the market for information brokers! After all, your citizens surely have nothing to hide..."

3. "No, no, no, NO!" screeches Minister of Intelligence @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ '008' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ emerges from behind a curtain in your office. "I've had enough of this! Everyone is learning everything about everyone and that's my job, for Violet's sake! Not only do you need to ban companies like My23AncestralHeritages, but you also need to drastically limit what information can be released to the public! Or do you want your enemies to know all your genetic codes?"

4. "You know, there is an opportunity here," points out @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The amount of genetic data that company has is staggering. Think of what we could do if they partnered with our brilliant scientists. We could take the best genetic samples and secretly engineer vat-grown soldiers, bred for fighting strength and absolute loyalty to you, their supreme leader!"

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ wolf, once hunted to near extinction, has started to make a recovery. While this development has been celebrated by environmentalists, ranchers are less excited as they have started to lose stock to wolf attacks.

The Debate
1. "These wolves are murdering my steers!" growls local beef rancher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leading you round Blazing Pitchforks Ranch, and showing you the mauled bovine carcasses. "If the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ wolf is common enough to eat a quarter of my herd, it's common enough to be hunted again. We can do it right this time, with permits and regulations so we don't kill every wolf; we just need to cull their packs so they stop thinning my herds."

2. "You can't kill the wolfies!" howls local precocious eight-year-old @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Wolves are like doggies but bigger, and I read in my science book that they are important because they keep other animals in check, and I really like wolves. If the farmers are sad because the wolves eat their cows then maybe the government could give them money so they'd be happy again."

3. "Kid's right, you shouldn't kill the wolves," barks local cow@@BOY@@ @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while polishing @@HIS@@ tranquilizer dart gun. "But we can't leave 'em here to eat up our cattle, neither. I reckon we ought to tranquilize the wolves and relocate them to the heart of Violetstone National Park where they can't bother nobody."

4. "I think we've got the victim and predator mixed up," whines city-slicker environmental lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while obliviously stepping in a cow pie. "The wolves are just doing what wild animals do; it's the cattle that are distracting the wolves from their natural prey. You need to ban Big Farmer from grazing these beasts anywhere there are wolves, so ecological harmony can truly reign supreme."

1. "I mean, credit where it's due..." reminisces your cousin Corporal @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@HIS@@ uniform blanketed in medals. "They know how to fight, and they know why they fight. Once my squad captured an enemy captain, and @@HE_1@@ argued a really interesting, compelling case for why they were against us. Ended up swapping stories with @@HIM_1@@ and the rest of the POWs on hand. Maybe we need to stop fighting and start a dialogue. Might get us to realise that both sides have a point and there's no need to lose any more lives..."

2. "This is a very grave problem," asserts political cartoonist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, drawing an exaggerated image of your likeness. "Empathy for the enemy will diminish operational effectiveness — you need to demonise the nation's opponents. Why don't you institute extensive pre-op briefings explaining why the enemy is evil? Some graphic informational pamphlets and posters should do the trick!"

3. "It's a dangerous world out there!" cries Intelligence Operative @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a handgun menacingly at a map on your wall. "If our personnel keep interacting with foreign adversaries, we will have a mutiny on our hands! Tell the troops to execute all prisoners while ceasing interaction with local populations. Corruption can't possibly spread within our ranks that way!"

[4]. "That seems a bit rash," dryly notes scientist Rey van Straaten, blueprints for an esoteric new weapon in hand. "We should stay as far away from them as possible.

[5]. "Why does a man go to fight and die?" pontificates salesman @@RANDOM_NAME@@ representing the "Payday Goons" private security company.

The Issue
Following a high-profile stadium tour by @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ nationalist metal band [i]Exterminate Bigtopia[/i], there has been a surge in the number of anti-Bigtopian hate crimes. Only yesterday, skinheads set fire to an effigy of a Bigtopian teacher in the playground of your nephew's school, and the PTA are pressing you to take action.

The Debate
1. "Look at what this awful racket has done to our children," sobs Efthamia Wickremesinghe, leader of [i]Bigtopian Mothers Against Malicious Anthems[/i], better known as [i]BigMAMA[/i]. "My family is made up of three generations of proud @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, at least two of which speak the language like natives! But now my little @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ is being exposed to hateful extremist music at all hours of the night! You must ban all music that is racist in content, or made by racists."

2. Your teenage niece, who is wearing a band T-shirt depicting a decapitated Bigtopian, elbows her way into your office to yell at you. "This is exactly why everyone's mad at you! Who cares if big-nosed Bigtopians are offended? Leave us metal fans alone and let us listen to whatever we want to."

3. The teenager's mother, from the rotten side of the family, totters over to offer you a pamphlet on 'Devil Immigrants'. "Now dearie, all that guitar noise is a little unpleasant, but you must admit that Bigtopians are criminals, and have taken quite a lot of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ jobs, and are genetically subhuman, of course. Maybe we shouldn't be letting those sort of people live with us."

[b][anchor=1301]#1301[/anchor]: Meat the Neighbours [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
State-level agricultural organisation and socialist worker toil has paid off: @@NAME@@ is producing high-quality cuts of meat that are internationally recognised as being exceptionally delicious. So much so, that those foreign capitalists are sniffing around to see if they can have a cut of the action.

The Debate
1. "Thing is, 'comrade', what you've got here is a prime product which is in high demand across the world," schmoozes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of Cold Capitalist Logistics. "We're not asking you to abandon a governmental system that is clearly delivering great results; we're just hoping that y'all let us help share your product with the global market. The cash coming back to your state coffers will help fund your commie agenda. That's a good thing, right?"

2. "Wait, we do the work, and you pocket the profits?" asks local farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ somewhat incredulously, as @@HE@@ slides on an elbow-length rubber glove in a worryingly menacing fashion. "Way I see it, the people doing the work should be rewarded in proportion to the wealth they generate. Basically, let the proceeds of the sale filter back to a company of folk in charge of the operation, who can then use that money to employ some workers, and those workers can use their new personal wealth to buy and trade freely, while the various processes that are incorporated in production can compete against each other to provide the best-selling product for the lowest prices. I'm sure I've heard of a system like that before..."

3. "The purpose of state agriculture is not to feed capitalist nations!" yells horrified Marxist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, making a note to report the previous speaker to the National Loyalty Bureau. "The produce of @@NAME@@ should meet the needs of the proletariat. If we produce too much for @@NAME@@, then we should send it freely to other socialist countries to aid the global revolution! This is what communism is about: the pursuit of an efficient and fair society worldwide, not the generation of filthy lucre!"

4. "Actually, looking at the numbers, I'm wondering about our overall agricultural strategy," murmurs statistician and economic planner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, skinny fingers tapping at a calculator. "The ratio of land and labour use to calorie output is very poor for meats of all sorts, and we would be far better off with arable farming alone, and a meat-free national diet. Freeing up workers from food production would let us reassign them to other more modern industries, such as electronics and tech production. This is a chance to show the world the strength and efficiency of a properly run planned economy."

The Issue
Halfway across the world a small and not particularly important nation has gained internationally recognized independence. The problem? They have decided to call themselves @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "Tourists accidentally flying to the wrong part of the world, diplomatic communiques wired to the wrong ambassadors," moans your advisor, who confusingly shares your name. "There are millions of perfectly fine, unused names for nations; why'd they have to filch ours? Issue threats, impose sanctions, do whatever it takes to get our good name back."

2. On the phone is the improbably named @@LEADER@@ Jr., president of the other @@NAME@@. "@@NAME@@ is derived from anthropologists' translation of the oldest 'Linear V' tablet found in our nation. Or maybe they're just some meaningless scribbles; they aren't totally sure. The point is we have a legitimate claim to the name, and we're not changing it!"

3. "A small, newly independent, weak nation you say?" asks your Minister of War, Jacob John Schmidt Jingleheimer. "An easy way to reduce the ambiguity is to simply make them our territory. Besides, if @@NAME@@ invades @@NAME@@, wouldn't the international community just consider it a civil war?"

4. "Look, maybe there's a compromise we could make here," suggests a passer-by. "I hear that the World Census people have put in a mechanism for nations to change which letters are capitalized in nation names, so for example Brancaland could choose to rename itself bRanCaLand. Perhaps as a gesture of goodwill we could offer the other @@NAME@@ a sizeable foreign aid allocation, with the condition that they stick the capital letters in different places to make it clear they're not us. It'll work, I'm sure, or my name's not maX bARRy."

The Issue
The @@NAME@@ College Sports Association has a long-standing policy that collegiate athletes do not get paid. Several high-profile players have taken to camping out in the student loan office until their grievances are addressed.

The Debate
1. "Our team brings zillions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to campus," notes @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, a member of the University of @@NAME@@ @@ANIMAL@@ball team. "We put our blood, sweat, and tears into representing this school, and we don't even get compensation for our work!

2. "Kids these days," trails off @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an executive of the @@NAME_INITIALS@@CSA, struggling to remember @@HIS@@ talking point. "I mean to say, they're already being paid in scholarships! Elite athletes will have plenty of time to profit from their talents once their school days are over, so don't let scholarship recipients be distracted by monetization. They need to stay focused on earning their degrees."

3. "Not all sports are equally profitable," says snow volleyball player @@RANDOM_NAME@@, taking a break from practice. "Professionalizing collegiate athletes would let popular @@ANIMAL@@ball players like @@LASTNAME_1@@ make bank while programs like mine fall by the wayside. @@NAME@@ should enforce a code of amateurism in all its sports, on campus or off. It's the only way to be fair."

4. "Who let all these jocks on campus?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an honors student at the University of @@CAPITAL@@. "The point of higher education is to pursue knowledge and prepare for your career, not watching your sweaty classmates fight over their balls. Let's do away with college sports entirely and reaffirm our commitment to what university is really about: learning, research, and pursuing hot co-eds."

An intelligence team, the "Agents Undercover to Neutralize Troublemakers", has pinpointed the headquarters of notorious crime boss Sal Bone. Unfortunately, it is concealed within a local orphanage, of which Mr. Bone is a sponsor. Lacking only a smoking gun, AUNT has come to your office with a delicate request.

The Debate
1. "AUNT would like to launch a mole operation inside the orphanage," buzzes Special Agent Angela Haskell, radioing in from an undisclosed location. "One problem: none of the team is young enough to pull off an effective inside job. We've been kicking around the idea of recruiting and training a few kids — maybe orphans themselves — to act as our eyes and ears. Already got a circus kid named Grayson as a potential candidate. There's a lot of covert situations where juvenile agents could be useful. If this mission goes well, we could even expand their role into a full-time intelligence division."

2. "The team opinion ain't unanimous!" yells Special Agent Miley Orbison, her voice crackling through the receiver. "We don't need to endanger defenseless children! We just need to teach smaller-sized adult women how to act like kids. With a convincing enough performance, I'm sure they'll pass as kids in no time!"

3. "What are these fools waiting for?" bellows Colonel @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, furiously switching off the communication channel. "A 90% certainty is good enough for me. The best thing to do is to stop messing about, and authorize SWAT teams to kick down doors, blast holes in walls, and raid the orphanage, ASAP. Perhaps if we had a little more efficiency, we could cut AUNT's departmental budget, and channel it into funding actual combat-ready military counter-terrorism units."

4. "I represent a group which is... strongly concerned... with the ever-increasing surveillance state within this great nation," murmurs a @@DEMONYM@@ in a dapper black suit, sidling into the room to hand you a freshly-printed business card. "Spying on a private citizen, a benefactor of an orphanage no less, is nothing less than harassment." @@HE@@ gestures tenderly to a large briefcase sitting next to @@HIM@@. "I'm sure a... satisfactory arrangement can be reached here. You wouldn't want to frighten some perfectly innocent children, now would you?"

A report released by the Mathematical Sciences Institute has revealed that only one in four @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ schoolchildren is taught by a qualified math teacher. Your advisers speculate that the populace may eventually be rendered too ignorant to pay their taxes, and so urge immediate action.

The Debate
1. "We have plenty of teachers; they just don't teach math... yet," remarks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a high-level education official. "So just retrain a bunch of 'em. Mandatory retraining sessions can be held whenever student demand is light, like evenings, weekends, lunch breaks, and national holidays. But sooner or later, boom, you've got qualified math teachers. Didn't even need a calculator."

2. "If a school has four math classes, but only one math teacher, what should you do?" asks @@CAPITAL@@-area algebra teacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has been grading multiple choice questions for too long. "Should you, A, cry tears of despair over the impending mathocalypse? B, beat the living snot out of any useless, uninformed bureaucrats who advocate for what is, essentially, educator abuse? Or C, invest more @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ into math departments across @@NAME@@ in order to make teaching more appealing to graduates with math-related degrees? The answer here is clear."

3. "The school system is puttin' too much pressure on our kids," rambles rural bureaucrat @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Where I'm from, the only knowledge y'need is how to live off the land, and how to respect folks. So let's take math out of the curriculum, and stress more practical knowledge, like farming or resource conservation! Might sound stupid, but I never learnt math, and I'm just fine!

*4. "We've got a brainpower outage, it seems," states Deputy Minister of Immigration @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Perhaps the addition of skilled, foreign labor is just what we need.

3. Your cousin, who just stopped by to bring you cookies, pipes in. "I think community service programs are a great idea.

The Issue
Public health officials across @@NAME@@ are demanding a restriction on bushmeat consumption, asserting that handling and eating bushmeat can transfer new and deadly diseases from animals to humans. These officials cite VODAIS, ebola and coronavirus as examples of diseases that were originally contracted by humans after eating bushmeat. You have arrived in the jungles of southern @@NAME@@ to assess the nation's bushmeat market.

The Debate
1. "This is how a pandemic starts," declares Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@HIS@@ arm extended at the scene before you. "You see here stalls selling bushmeat from the jungle, some scavenged from already-dead carcasses. Wild animals are pathogen factories; we shouldn't be ingesting their flesh. Look at that butcher's floor, covered in monkey blood! VODAIS started with cross-species viral transmission, and this is how the next killer will start too. Good public health practice demands that you should restrict the sale and consumption of meat from non-farmed animals." 

2. "Stop stirring the pot," jeers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a bushmeat vendor, chewing on a grilled bat wing. "This fearmongering kills business and keeps us poor and starving. You scientists have heads full of ideas, but we need full bellies! We cannot survive without bushmeat, and it is part of our culture! Besides, people only get sick because they're not used to how rich and delicious it tastes. If the government really wants to help you should supply us with meat lockers, soap, hunting equipment and logistics assistance to help us bring the meats to market." 

3. "Let them eat ape!" declares military strategist Mary Antwunnet. "This place is a breeding ground for new deadly diseases. Under the guise of altruism, we could set up a center here to monitor and research new viruses. We could pretend to be helping the villagers while secretly weaponizing our findings. We'll be at the top of the world's food chain when we're done." 

4. "We can't really force our way of living on these peoples," states your Minister for Creative Solutions. "It's not them that's the problem; it's our involvement in their society spreading potentially infected meat. Let's leave them alone. We'll remove all trace of our civilization — hospitals, medical facilities and so on and declare it a nature reserve, with only the locals being allowed to live here. With a strict quarantine for anyone coming in or out, there's no chance of a virus beyond their villages."

The Issue
Joan Cranmer — a mother who walked out on her partner and son two years ago, voluntarily cutting off all contact until she recently petitioned for custody — has just been awarded full custody of her son by the courts, with the judge stating "children are simply better off with their mother." This controversial ruling has led to calls for you to intervene.

The Debate
1. "She abandoned @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@, and now she wants to play mummy?" snaps Ed, Joan's ex-partner. "She doesn't even know him; I do. His favourite show is [i]Adolescent Zombie Ninja @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@[/i]. When he's sick, he likes boysenberry juice, through a curly straw. Mothers should know these things, but she went off to 'find herself'. I've done an amazing job with my son, and thanks to my help, he gets excellent grades in school now. Child custody should go to the most suitable parent, not just the one with the uterus. Fit parents don't dump their kid when they get bored."

2. "I was bored with Ed, not my son," insists Joan. "Ed is a very narcissistic man; he was stifling my soul. I couldn't even have friends. Now, I'm much better; I have my own career, and a lovely flat near one of the top schools in the country. I can provide for my son materially and I can be there emotionally. All children need their mother, no matter what. I am grateful that Ed stepped into the breach in my absence, but nothing can make up for a mother's love."

3. "A mother merely does what any common cat does," remarks proudly misogynist author of the mothering guide [i]Stop Whining and Push[/i]. "Why does simple childbirth give women special custody rights? Mothers may feel attachment, but fathers provide moral and mental instruction. See how the boy's grades improved with his father's influence." He holds up a book report with 'Did your father write this?' at the bottom. "Clearly, fathers are the more fit parent and should gain child custody in separations."

4. "Hi!" @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@ waves at you from the floor. "Why don't big people ever ask me what I want? I want to live with Mummy and Daddy again, in a candyfloss castle with a pet @@ANIMAL@@. But Mummy and Daddy say 'no'... because Daddy's a 'gnat-brained mule' and because Mummy's a 'satanic slattern from Hell'... I think that means they're not friends any more.

Investigation has revealed that an infantryman in the group had been innocently emailing his girlfriend at home about what he was up to, and she in turn had been posting updates on social media, which your observant foes had been carefully monitoring.

A hundred-car funeral procession happened to be passing by the @@CAPITAL@@ stadium just after the final game of the national @@ANIMAL@@ball Cup. The resulting massive traffic jam lasted for the rest of the day and blocked roads in most of downtown @@CAPITAL@@.

The Debate
1. "The funeral procession only blocked traffic because rude sports fans weren't giving them right of way," complains undertaker 'Hit-and-Run' Han. "If funeral processions were given absolute traffic priority, then the problem would be solved."

2. "The funeral was responsible for the traffic!" shouts angry sports fan Marleen Torres while making threatening gestures with an @@ANIMAL@@ball bat. "If they hadn't been moving at walking pace, there would have been no congestion. They should be expected to drive at the same speed as normal traffic, and there ought to be a maximum of five vehicles in a procession. In fact, if the dead were moved in vans instead of hearses, then nobody would feel the need to treat them differently on the road."

3. "It seems to me that the problem is traffic in general," states your transportation minister while doodling a skull and crossbones on a subway map.

The Issue
After the recent birth of the first child of Princess @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ of @@NAME@@, newspaper pundits have begun to question how Her Royal Highness will juggle the responsibilities of parenthood with her royal duties.

The Debate
1. "Look no further than I, your super-duper firm-but-fair classy granny's nanny," announces Kerri Cracking, sweeping through the door with a stylish bag made entirely out of mohair carpet. "Close your mouths, please, Ministers — we are not a codfish. As you see, I have worked only with the right sorts of family. I am stern, but kind; I don't put up with any nonsense, but have a somewhat magical effect on the youngsters. With me, the newborn royal will learn good manners, graceful refinement and be prepared to take their proper place in the world. Tell the applicants waiting outside to go fly a kite so I can get on. Spit spot."

2. "What century are you living in?" retorts your brand new Minister for Women's Equality @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, while scanning some application forms rather closely. "The royal nanny should be qualified in the latest childcare techniques, child development and first aid, and should be female. This will show the women of the nation your commitment to female employment. And she should be pretty. That way, a Rainbow Pony girls will know that being pretty doesn't mean a girl can't have talents; it'll bust stereotypes. And as the Princess is all pudgy and wan after the birth, it wouldn't hurt to have her trailed by someone more photogenic... Okay, who said that I won't last a week at the Ministry?"

[3]. "What century are we living in indeed?" asks your Minister for Transport, while adjusting the rainbow pin on his suit. "Why don't you hire a manny? A professional manny will be just as well-trained in childcare as any female nanny, and can be glamorous, ensuring the royal children are dressed in the latest and best styles. Not only that, it will show how progressive the royal family are, and how the entire community and their potential contribution to childrearing — regardless of their gender or sexual orientation — is valued. That's sure to win support for the royal family. How about it?" [[color=blue]Same-sex marriage is legal[/color]]

4. "Why embrace this century when you can embrace the future?" chimes your slightly singed Junior Science Adviser, lugging in his latest robotic prototype. "Meet LUL-2000, an AI nanny. Now, I know the blinking red eye looks a little strange and the hands are still a bit claw-like; the next one will have a skin on it, I swear. But think of this: it'll show your commitment to technology and science, and it'll give me a chance to show off the capabilities of my prototype. It feeds babies, burps them, changes them and puts them to bed content and safe 96.7% of the time. And the percentage [i]is[/i] rising. I mean, the kids might be scared to begin with but they'll adapt, right?"

5. "Or, here's a revolutionary idea," storms an exhausted woman as she bursts through the door, shaking off a toddler clinging to her leg and bouncing a crying newborn. "How about all the toffs look after their right royal brats their right royal selves? Crazy idea, I know. Royals are all busy dubbing ships [i]@@NAME_INITIALS@@S Snooty-Arse[/i] and whatever royals do. Well, I'm sorry, but other working mothers have to manage: up before dawn to do housework, spend half an hour with the kids, feed them, then out to work.

The Issue
A woman in southern @@NAME@@ has written a letter directly to you after being denied an abortion by her doctor, who feared contravening the laws that declare terminating pregnancies to be illegal. She is sixteen weeks pregnant with an anencephalic foetus — missing part of the skull and brain — who will live for a short time, and is herself rapidly sickening with complications related to lupus. Doctors have told her therapeutic abortion is her best chance for life, and would be offered in many countries, but not in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "Doctors often fear prescribing some treatments deemed most effective by global health organisations, in case it harms the foetus," argues Dr. Doris @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, not looking up as she works her way through a stack of paperwork. "If a woman is dying from a septic miscarriage, we fear intervening in case the foetus might still be alive, and are blocked from carrying out abortions even when it would save the mother's life. Women's health should not be second-class. Medical professionals should be exempt from sanction if foetal loss occurs as a result of our care, and should be allowed to carry out abortions where medically necessary. I'm not saying we should be proud of offering abortions, but we quietly and discretely do so when the need arises." 

2. "And what about the senseless slaughter of innocent babies?" sniffs Dr. Peter @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, who has eight children that he rarely sees. "There is no moral justification possible for the murder of a child. None, ever. Besides, pregnancy — even with lupus — is safer than it has ever been. It is possible that both [i]may[/i] live. Train doctors to treat women conservatively, preventing any avoidable harm to their pre-born children. Remember that there's two people here, and both deserve a chance to live."

3. "Some mothers are but phoenices," muses Ms. Lotta Childe, the childless partner of the founder of moralist group [i]As I Say[/i]. "Born to die, so that a new generation might arise from the ashes of their deaths. All birth is good, for life equals potential — ergo goodness. Rather than this ten-a-penny carrier's bugaboo, consider her tragic infant. We squander so much money on medicalising a normal, simple process. Let us return to wholly natural gestation and birth; prenatal scans and checks only worry the breeding stock unnecessarily. [i]If[/i] there are mishaps, remind mothers that only through sacrifice does our worthless existence mean something."

4. "The presence of pro-life legislation is critical to the moral health of this nation, but we cannot be entirely inflexible," offers Naomi @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, your Minister of Problematic Trolleys. "We should maintain our moral and legal stance in @@NAME@@, but allow for one-off exceptions to be made to allow specific patients to travel overseas for an abortion. Due consideration should involve a panel of experts and ethicists, as this is not a decision to be undertaken lightly."

The Issue
The @@ANIMAL@@ Room — a @@CAPITAL@@ nightclub known as a swinging hotspot — was recently the site of a tragic fire that started with a flaming sambuca shot and ended claiming the lives of hundreds. Fire investigators have attributed the high number of deaths to multiple causes, but most notably the large revolving door which was the only access to the premises, which panicked crowds jammed against as they tried to escape the blaze.

The Debate
1. "Imagine being pushed from behind, trying to get through a door which you know is unlocked, but which is providing no escape because of the mass of people trying to get through," narrates criminal legislator Melody Grove. "The simple solution? Doors that swing outwards. Every revolving door must either be flanked by or replaced by swing doors, and proper fire exits must be built into every building that is accessible to the public."

2. "Look, I'm sad, I'm super sad about that tragedy," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, manager of competing nightclub @@CAPITAL@@ Nights, as @@HE@@ pens a flyer for a Special Memorial Tribute Disco. "But do you really want all that bureaucracy putting a dampener on the whole nocturnal recreation industry? I tell you, all those dead party-goers would be spinning in their graves! Instead, step back and let the invisible hand of capitalism guide future fire safety measures. Customer choice and the laws of market competition will result in safer nightclubs, I guarantee it!"

3. "There's potentially a silver lining here to the black clouds of smoke around this situation," mentions your Minister of Surprises, popping up from behind a sofa. "A known dissident and vocal critic of your rule was amongst the dead. We should see this as a signpost to future opportunities. With a little surveillance of our political opponents' social habits, a little well-planned arson, and a few strategically locked doors... well, let's just say your problems will go up in smoke."

"Releasing the names of these winners puts them in considerable risk. Last month's winner was harassed by former partners, stalked by tireless panhandlers, and nearly robbed by half a dozen chuggers!

3. "You have got to be kidding!" replies kindergarten teacher Harold Weissenegger. "If you think my precious little kiddos are better off in a musty old folks' home, you're insane.

The Debate
1. "How dare this heathen accuse us of such a thing!" thunders your Minister of Righteousness, @@RANDOM_NAME@@.

The Issue
Two missionaries have been arrested in the avowedly atheist hermit nation of West Fedoriah while supposedly on a sightseeing tour of the country. They stand accused of undermining the nation by proselytising on behalf of @@FAITH@@.

The Debate
1. "This is a clear and concerted effort to foment dissent against our glorious Republic," phones in the West Fedorian ambassador from his embassy, a repurposed bungalow on the outskirts of @@CAPITAL@@. "Our legal system is very clear on the penalties for such a heinous crime: twenty years hard labour in one of our reeducation camps. I imagine our President might be tempted to show some clemency in this case, were you to make an entirely voluntary donation to his chosen charity, the World Atheism Independently Funded Union."

2. "It's never been our policy to support this kind of reckless endeavor," sighs religious leader Ali Hyde. "Well, not for the last couple of hundred years at any rate. Look, while I appreciate the contributions these two have made to our faith, it seems clear to me this is a diplomatic matter, not a religious one. Why don't we leave them to their fate, and stop all future travel to West Fedoriah to dissuade any other wannabe proselytists?"

3. "These two holy missionaries are martyrs of the faith!" declares your Minister of Holy Wars. "Or at least they will be, after we carpet bomb the city where their prison is. We must show these West Fedorians that they can't mess with @@FAITH@@! You must agree: a crusade to convert them from atheism to the one true faith is the only way forward."

The Issue
A long-awaited undersea tunnel linking @@NAME@@ to the island nation of Albionia has been completed — and motorists are rejoicing, or would be — if it weren't for the fact that Albionia drives on the opposite side of the road. Whilst the changeover happens easily, foreign motorists arriving in @@NAME@@ sometimes get confused over which side to drive on, leading to an increase in accidents.

The Debate
1. "I've had a vision on how to solve this," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Transport Minister, as @@HE@@ places a name-tag holder around your neck. "We just need to erect more signage and road markings telling people to drive on the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ side of the road. This simple and economic measure will remind motorists which nation they are in, and the accidents will cease."

2. "These Albionians are a bunch of nincompoops and a few signs won't stop them from driving on the wrong side," complains traffic warden Winston Sanders, who's notorious for yelling at motorists. "I mean, I caught an Albionian going the wrong way around a roundabout. How do you even do that? Everyone knows that if you drive on the left side of the road, go clockwise, and if you drive on the right, go anti-clockwise. Signage won't help. We need to ban Albionians from driving here until they pass our driving test."

3. "I have the solution... again," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Creative Solutions, as @@HE@@ uses one of @@HIS@@ shoes as an impromptu drinks holder. "Why don't we just make all our roads one way? Then it doesn't matter which side of the road you drive on, nor which side the steering wheel is on. It only matters in which direction you travel."

The Issue
The invasion of Ausonia was supposed to be over by last Maxxmas. However, the Ishkurian army has found itself in a state of deadlock with the enemy. Many of your frontline generals are complaining about the lack of battle-readiness of your newest recruits, and reporting that they are panicking when under fire. To counter this, it has been suggested that Harmonic Empire should increase the intensity of live-fire training exercises.

The Debate
1. "This makes perfect sense to me," proclaims General Harris, setting up a line of toy soldiers on a map of the front-line, which is a safe 300 miles away. "Training should be more realistic, to make sure new recruits are ready for front-line battlefield conditions. This won't be risk free, of course, and we'd accept a training fatality rate of one percent. Actually... better make it two percent, just to be on the safe side. Better that than dying in the field, eh?"

2. "If you want better morale, the answer is not more dangerous training," opines a former social worker turned army lieutenant. "The answer is emotional support workers, a military culture open to talking about feelings, and support bundles for front line forces feeling the stress. We should be teaching our soldiers to admit to crying, and feeling scared. Everybody gets frightened sometimes!"

3. "There's a far simpler solution," states Major General Oliver, sending the lieutenant scurrying out of the room by firing a cap gun. "As soon as a new recruit signs on the dotted line, have the recruitment officer shoot him in the leg with a pistol, then the new recruit will know what being shot feels like. It will only take a couple of months to recover from a flesh wound, the same amount of time training takes. Then we can ship them off to the front-line, confident in the knowledge that they've already been through worse."

4. "It's not just the military that needs to be prepared," observes Brigadier van Straaten laconically. "At the moment, we're taking the fight to Ausonia. War has a propensity of turning up surprises, and maybe in a year or so Ausonia will be taking the fight to us. We also need to toughen up our civilians — get them used to bombs falling around them as well, so that they will become proficient at getting into shelters quickly, then carrying on with life after an air-raid. Start bombing our own towns and cities now!"

The Issue
A recent exposé revealed that growth hormone therapy — an expensive treatment meant to help children who are producing little to no growth hormone on their own — is increasingly being prescribed to wealthy children who are just somewhat shorter than average.

The Debate
1. "I just want what's best for my little Timmy; what parent wouldn't?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME1@@, who appears to have bribed your guards into getting an unscheduled meeting with you. "Growth hormone therapy is completely safe and the best doctor money could buy said it was a medically valid treatment for my little Timmy, what with him being [i]two whole inches[/i] below normal.

"There's nothing wrong with being shorter than average, even way shorter than average. You can't call something a 'treatment' if there are no adverse health effects associated with the 'illness' it treats. Ban growth hormone therapy in all cases and teach @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to love each other no matter what their size."

5. "I agree that the government should assure no one feels inferior because of the hand nature dealt to them," asserts everyman Berger Harrison, who is so average as to be completely unidentifiable. "However, what we should be doing is manipulating the hormones of all children so that they all end up at exactly the same height. All men may not be created equal, but we can fix that."

A former member of your cabinet has just been executed for masterminding a plot to assassinate you and take power. While most are now satisfied that the threat has been dealt with, one particularly paranoid adviser has raised the issue of the deceased's family.

1. "These scoundrels are tainted by the crime of their kin," says one of your fervently loyal ministers, as @@HE@@ shows you information on the family along with their pictures. "Treachery runs in their blood and we must rip it out, root and stem. The only solution is to execute the entire family as well.

[2]. "I think executing them is a little bit extreme," counters your sister as she looks over the documents of the family.

"Let them think they are in your good books, but keep a close eye on them for the rest of their lives. Constant surveillance will make sure they don't get up to anything seditious."

The Issue
A recent midnight explosion at the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ National Steelworks, which claimed nine lives and injured a dozen more, was found to be due to an easily fixable error. The blocked release valve that was responsible did have an alarm circuit attached to it, which was warning that there was a problem. However, this was overlooked by no less than five safety technicians who all claim not to have noticed the flashing red light. The scale of the industrial disaster that followed this error has led to a government investigation.

The Debate
1. "This is about fatigue on the job. I warned my bosses, but nobody listens to me for some reason," says Floor Technician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, in a whiny monotone voice that would be so easy to just tune out. "Shift work, antisocial hours and inadequate length of break times and so on and so forth. Oh, I could go on and on. Dangerous heavy industry should only be allowed to operate during normal daytime hours, with decently long paid breaks and good union representation."

2. "No no, the problem here is information overload from warning fatigue," claims Systems Engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, helpfully turning off your TV set, radio and mobile phone so you can focus on what he is saying. "There are three dozen flashing lights and buzzing alarms on the work station, and that's basically too many. What we need is a comprehensive review of all workplaces to reduce all this electronic distraction, and mandate that systems be simplified down to just the base essentials."

[3]. "Actually, the problem is the inclusion of systems that are fatiguable," warns roboticist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "By which I mean humans.

The Issue
Attendance at last week's stoning in @@CAPITAL@@ Square was at a record low, as citizens decided instead to take a healthy walk, read self-improvement books, or merely exchange pleasantries with one another.

The Debate
1. "It ain't right!" gripes souvenir rock distributor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, gesturing to @@HIS@@ unwanted supplies of pointy rocks and bags of reinforced gravel. "Last week's stoning only had a boring old murderer — what punter's gonna waste high-grade silicates on them? Bring back the mafia kingpins! Chainsaw maniacs! Send the police out to hunt them down, from wherever they can find them. Now they're worth a good chunk of quartz, eh?"

2. "It's not the quality of targets that's the problem," opines your brother, tossing a stone at a nearby barn door, and missing. "It's that there aren't enough to go around. Stoning is a noble art, and you should show your appreciation with a steady stream of targets, be they petty thieves or jaywalkers. How else can I perfect my technique?"

3. "If you want these events to draw a crowd, there's no sense in everyone getting stoned," chortles rock fan @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This needs to be a special occasion that lives long in the memories of all those young and old — well, except the victims. We need stadia, lights, loud music and audience participation!

"I failed the citizenship test twice before I met @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@, otherwise I'd never have given him the time of day.

At a recent international summit in Brancaland, the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ delegation became violently ill. Brancalandian doctors say all of them were suffering withdrawal symptoms because they were addicted to the drugs in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ tap water.

The Debate
1. "It's really sad to see what these drugs have done to your people," quacks Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Brancalandian Health Service. "One of your envoy's aides almost died of hyponatremia because she drank so much water trying to get high. And that's not even getting into long-term health effects for people that have been on these drugs their whole lives, or the developmental effects on Deep children. Please, you have to stop drugging your country's drinking water. We can help you organize a detox program."

2. "Who ever heard of getting sick from drinking too much water? And what kind of nonsense word is 'hyponatremia'?" comes the muffled voice of the aforementioned aide, sulking beneath a blanket in her hospital bed. "Everyone knows it's important to stay hydrated. I'm not addicted to anything, and it's obvious this is all just a cover story to hide the fact that someone poisoned us! We need to pull our diplomats out of Brancaland for their own safety and send those nasty Brancalandians a strongly worded letter!"

The Issue
A video surreptitiously filmed in the First Class cabin of government-owned Air @@NAME@@ has been leaked to the media. This clandestine footage shows a government official eating truffles while making unsavory comments regarding the supposed poverty and personal hygiene of passengers flying Economy Class.

The Debate
1. "Those insults are an absolute disgrace to the socialist ideals of @@NAME@@," sneers electrician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a passenger on the flight in question. "Having all us @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ divided, even just for air travel, only ends up hurting what we all fought so hard for in the Revolution. Sure, it starts with petty insults today, but it'll only escalate from here. After firing that official, you must make it your mission to tear down the walls of oppression once again. @@LEADER@@, I call upon you to unite all airline passengers into a single People's Class!"

2. "Come on, it was a joke!" stammers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the bureaucrat responsible for the comment. "I wouldn't have said anything if I had known these people can't take even harmless banter. For Violet's sake, someone threw fancy cheese at me on the way here, the smelly kind! I'm no class traitor — I work hard and mostly pay my taxes, just like everyone else! If these people want to feel some more equity in the air, they can save their @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ for a better ticket like the rest of us. Less complaining and more working sounds like a socialist ideal too, if you ask me!"

3. "Perhaps a compromise is in order," chimes your Minister of Air Travel @@RANDOM_NAME@@, playing with a miniature jet. "Completely restructuring our airline system to a single travel class would be prohibitively expensive with little practical benefit. But the class divisions we have now do seem counter to our central planning objectives. I would suggest introducing a raffle system. Make all ticket prices a flat fee, and simply assign the seating at random. That way we maintain the spirit of equality and fairness, without any major new expenses. Sure, some people will still be flying high while the rest are cramped together — but at least now there's no one to point fingers at."

[b][anchor=1336]#1336[/anchor]: Take Good Care of My Baby [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The nation has affirmed a strong pro-life stance, with abortions illegal and the sanctity of unborn life held to be inviolable. As a result, many unwanted pregnancies have been carried to term, with a not-insignificant number of new mothers immediately giving up their children for adoption.

The Debate
1. "I'm sorry that I can't be there for the baby, but look, I'm not even an adult myself, and I'm just not ready to be a mum," sobs @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a fourteen-year-old girl who refused to even hold her son on the day he was born. "I was thirteen when I got pregnant. You can't say I made a proper consenting choice to have a baby! Your law forced me to carry him for nine months; now you can carry him right on out of here. Just pay for more foster carers, or get more people to adopt, or whatever. I don't care. I never wanted that baby and I don't need him ruining my life, so he's your problem now."

2. "For sure, we need to look after woebegone babies, but what babies really need is their parents," lectures Welfare Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, thrusting a photo of the newborn at the mother with an accusing sniff. "We need to invest in antenatal and postnatal classes to teach that parenthood is a joy, and perhaps offer tax incentives to nuclear families that stay together. Maybe also charge a mandatory upkeep fee to parents who abandon their children to social care. A child needs family structure, and we should be encouraging this as much as possible."

3. "Right, though allowing welfare to prop up failing families is part of the problem," adds childless conservative Rush Limpbough. "The state should not interfere in what happens to unwanted children. If there's no alternative but to raise a kid themselves, new parents will have to step up to the plate and get it done. If they can't manage, their extended families will step in. It's tough love, but at the end of it, you've got kids raised by their families, as nature intended."

[4]. "If they can't manage, we have bigger problems," intones John Smith, an unremarkable paper-pusher from the local Parental Licensing Office. "These people, licensed or not, should never have been parents. And, making matters worse, if they're unlicensed, we're out of options - they can't abort, but taking their kids away puts us right back in square one. Not only do we need to tighten up the licensing process — investigate prospective licensees' socioeconomic backgrounds and support networks, on top of their parenting knowledge — but we need to make the penalties for unlicensed childbearing significantly more punitive. That'll discourage parents from ever avoiding our rules." [[color=blue]Must have Parental Licensing[/color]]

1. "This is an untapped medical resource of considerable scientific value," explains @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, the Director of the @@NAME@@ Stem Cell Research Institute, urging you to look at an image depicting a life-sized zygote. "Life-saving research can and has been carried out using foetal material. For example, past experiments that gave us the polio vaccine.

2. "I understand that abortion is sometimes regrettably necessary, but these are still human remains that we're talking about here," argues funeral director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, glancing dolefully at @@LASTNAME_1@@. "The bereaved family should perhaps instead be given counsel on options for a dignified funeral service, and the importance of mourning the lost little life.

The Issue
A book on race and intelligence written by a prominent, but controversial, geneticist has caused a mighty kerfuffle with its claim that some groups are naturally less intelligent than others.

The Debate
1. "Group differences in intelligence are purely environmental," argues @@RANDOM_NAMEMALE@@, an academic and Bigtopian immigrant, handing his well-tailored cashmere coat to your intern and adjusting his ascot tie. "Performance results on intelligence tests are influenced by test bias and stereotype threat. Wealthy people who are better educated have higher scores, while the necessitous with their poor nutrition never stand a chance. It has nothing to do with genetics. Give minorities better education and living standards and they'll catch up."

2. "I just said that poor educational performance reflects an underlying genetic cause, and that it's not because of any environmental factors," states the book's author, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ looks up 'necessitous' in a dictionary. "There have been observed differences between the average IQ scores of varying groups, which also show that these differences persist even after controlling for factors such as income. Throwing money at minorities doesn't help them; instead you should cut welfare for these people to motivate them to study harder and thus overcome their natural deficiencies.

The Issue
After a series of car crashes in @@CAPITAL@@ this week, all involving traditional, flesh-and-blood @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, the AI citizens of @@NAME@@ are saying that organic fallibility makes humans naturally bad drivers.

The Debate
1. "We machines have faster reaction times, better processing speeds and more driving ability than any meatbag motorists," lectures artificial intelligence and motorbiker EVL-KN:EVL. "I'm not saying we shouldn't let humans sit behind the wheel, but they should have AI help next to them to take over in dangerous situations. Or you know, when they think the humans are driving in a way that is ill-judged. We're all good at different things — us machines are better at risk assessment, logic, and quick-thinking, while meatbags are better at... at... other things, I'm sure."

*2. "Hmm... I'm just not convinced," wonders IT security researcher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is wholly human.

The Issue
While touring the @@CAPITAL@@ Decanting Room with a group of dignitaries who wish to tour the facilities for producing your vat-born population, you notice a woman quietly secreting a baby — too big to be a neonate — behind a pile of discarded vats.

The Debate
*1. "This is @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAMEFEMALE@@ Crowne," says the Director of Infant Hatcheries, pausing the tour. "And [i]that[/i] is her... sprog. What is the world coming to when a young lady chooses breeding like an uncontrolled lagomorph over healthy, legal recreational relations in the age of vats? I reprimanded her for not getting an abortion, and urge you to launch a campaign to encourage prompt clinic attendance. But now we are stuck with the... results of her laziness. Child Welfare should regularly check on Ms. Crowne; someone who erred so badly is unlikely to make a fit parent." [[color=blue]Must allow abortions[/color]]

*2. "This is @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAMEFEMALE@@ Crowne," says the Director of Infant Hatcheries, pausing the tour. "And that is her... sprog.

It's too late for Ms. Crowne, but we can still build clinics like Aldoustan's new Abortorama — such pretty pink floodlights, and ice-creams after every procedure — to encourage women to deal with future little problems." [[color=red]Must not allow abortions[/color]]

3. "This shows a lack of proper conditioning," intones the prim Directress of Neo-Pavlovian Conditioning and Thought Modification. "Good conditioning becomes the sum of an adult mind, and forces the body to comply unawares. Future vats should be engineered so many of our populace is born sterile, with just enough unsterilised ones for future genetic material. If you also grant my department custody of all children, born and future, we'd teach from infancy that obedience is healthy, motherhood obscene and unsterilised women must use contraceptives; we'd also drill women in their use. Our nation will be peaceful, and total obedience will be as automatic as breathing."

4. "I was thinking," whispers Ms. Crowne, and the Directress faints, "that I might like to keep my baby. John's a cute little wonder-baby. He's started rolling over a bit now; I thought they couldn't do that until they were about two. I technically haven't broken any laws; I tried to avoid pregnancy. I did give birth, so shouldn't I choose? I know mum's going to be disappointed that I did it this way — and it's not that the vats aren't great — but if a woman wants to have a baby and keep it, why shouldn't she decide?"

5. "Birth? Mother? Choose?" grunts your Minister of Coercive Free-Will, balking. "Filth! This hormone-addled woman [i]imagines[/i] she wants a life apart from the state. Very well, let her live completely apart from the state. There is money only for those who obey social mores; people such as Ms. Crowne and their baseborn brats can expect no right to employment, education, welfare, healthcare or any other service. If they protest, exile them — somewhere cold."

6. "Ms. Crowne's oopsie proves ze mother-child relationship is most important," insists Dr. Kinder-Schloss, the ambassador of an unpronounceable country beginning with an X and ending with a Y. "Childless vomen feel guilty; zey failed in a major part of ze female identity: ze joy of natural childbirth — und changing ze nappies und viping avay ze vomit.

The Issue
After an incident where members of fruitarian militant group [i]Grapes of Wrath[/i] scaled the palace for a protest, monarchists, etiquette enthusiasts and the gentry were aghast to discover that the monarchy of @@NAME@@ has no Royal Guard.

The Debate
1. "An old-fashioned Royal Guard, similar to that in pre-revolution Imperial Lebatuck, is the appropriate choice," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, weekend military reenactor and historical costumier, who trots into your office on horseback fully adorned with a sabre, braided tunic and bearskin busby. "Think of the elegance, and the impact on the world stage. @@LEADER@@, provide a mounted cavalry to stand guard over the royal household and really make the world's heads turn on state occasions. Not only will a regular ceremonial trooping of the colour provide a tourist focal point, it will also bring the craft of the ancient uniform makers to a modern audience!" He then salutes and canters out of your office. 

2. "Why move backwards, when you can showcase the smartest uniforms and latest weaponry?" asks young Prince @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAMEMALE@@, the heir apparent to a neighbouring monarchy, as he draws a robot holding a laser gun. "As I said to Papa, no-one wants a smelly old horse, when tanks and lasers and ray-shields are so much cooler! The monarch is the most important person; their family deserve to be guarded by a royal division dressed in full protective gear, and armed with the latest military tech. The battlefield shouldn't even get to test new military gadgets until the monarchy is protected by them. Why should piffling foot soldiers get new toys before the monarch's Guard?" 

3. "Erm... May I suggest your local bobby is the best person to protect against crime in @@NAME@@?" murmurs police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, known among criminals as 'The Doberman', as he timidly pushes his glasses up his nose. "The only reason we couldn't be here for those fruit-loops is because we were busting an infamous ring of jaywalking arsonists. Surely that proves we know what we're doing? If the Royal Family [i]really[/i] need protecting, we'll be right there." 

4. "Wait!

The Issue
Public unicycle sharing systems have been appearing all over @@NAME@@. Daily ridership has ballooned to several hundred thousand users across the nation, but the populace is divided about longer term practicality, safety and stability.

The Debate
1. "This has been an amazing improvement to my daily commute," says substitute teacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Previously, I'd have to transfer between two different buses, a gondola and a cable car to reach my job at Hightower High School for Highest Education. But now, I can just use my smart phone to rent a unicycle near my apartment and store it at the kiosk conveniently located on the roof of the school. Sure, not everyone is a skilled unicyclist, but maybe the government could help by subsidizing unicycle lessons in schools and workplaces, with suitably qualified teachers."

2. "These contraptions are putting me out of business, and are just plain weird," complains diesel tuk tuk driver @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I used to get around fifteen riders every hour, but now only get a few random tourists each day. It's meant to be traditional, what @@CAPITAL@@ is famous for! Look, I've got sixteen kids at home to feed and another three working their own tuk tuks, and let's face it, it's just not safe for people to be travelling on these one-wheeled death traps!

3. "Those gas-guzzling rickshaws are a blight on @@CAPITAL@@," counters environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Unicycle shares are a better alternative, but they too have already grown into an oversupplied nuisance. Our parks, beaches and lakes are littered with discarded unicycles! Many @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ have already died attempting to swallow the blasted things. Regulations need to be tightened and companies need to be held accountable for creating this mess."

Tragedy struck when commercial airline pilot @@RANDOM_NAME@@ deliberately crashed @@HIS@@ airplane into a mountain, causing the death of the 416 passengers and 12 crew on board. Afterwards, a medical report was leaked to the press revealing that the pilot had been declared "unfit for work" and suicidal by @@HIS@@ doctor, but had failed to report this information to @@HIS@@ employer.

The Debate
1. "What happened was the doctor's fault!" complains the pilot's brother, who is also blaming shoddy construction work for the broken door he kicked open to enter your office. "Had that quack reported the diagnosis to the airline, my beloved sibling would still be alive, as would all those other people. Pilots should be obliged to undergo regular mental evaluations and if someone is deemed unstable, the doctor should be required to report this to the aviation authorities."

2. "Look, the solution doesn't have to involve breaches of confidentiality and invasions of privacy," suggests a rep from the Federation Union of Commercial United Pilots. "The problem is a different one. Pilots in this country are completely mistreated, with airlines working them too hard for adequate mental health. It's no wonder that some of them get depressed, or burn out. Airlines should be made to pay better wages, to provide more sociable hours, and to grant more paid downtime between flights."

3. "Are you insane?" interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of budget airline EasyBlues. "Do you have any idea how much that would cost us? Do you want to be the one who forces ticket prices up? This all happened because the pilot who crashed the damn plane locked the cockpit when his co-pilot stepped out for a few minutes. Just enact laws that keep both pilot and co-pilot in the cockpit at all times. Cuff them to their seats for the duration of the flight; that'll stop them wandering."

Trampoline parks are springing up all over @@NAME@@, with legions of playful children of all ages leaping off raised platforms and bouncing off mats. Perhaps predictably, large numbers of injuries are occurring with a multitude of sprained ankles, a not insignificant number of broken limbs, and even a bizarre incident where two amorous braces-wearing teenagers became entangled and required urgent medical intervention.

The Debate
1. "One person per trampoline, no talking while jumping, land only on your feet, do not jump between trampolines, wall trampolines are for decorative purposes only, and the company is not liable for any injuries," recites @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Twist-and-Scream Jump Park. "That's what it says in our three minute mandatory induction video, and on the waivers that we make all customers sign, and on the big signs above the steel-spiked climbing wall. We don't need a nanny state telling people what they can and can't do, and if people hurt themselves then it's due to their own carelessness. Trampolining is actually great exercise for kids. In fact, you should subsidise schools who want to incorporate our play parks into their school PE lessons. It'll be fun and educational! Er... funducational!"

2. "Nobody is trying to stop kids having fun," snaps sour-faced parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pinning his four-year-old son's arms down to stop him touching a nearby balloon. "There just ought to be more stringent regulations of these businesses, and no legal weight to waiving responsibility for children under their care with a disclaimer. Fine them for each injury that occurs under their watch, and our children will be safer."

3.

The Issue
Multiple state warehouses that were supposed to be stacked high with sacks of freshly harvested crops were recently found to be empty, leaving many to speculate about bureaucratic mix-ups, corrupt black market reselling, or alien potato abductions. Investigations are ongoing, but in the meantime a lot of people are getting hungry.

The Debate
1. "We need to immediately direct our workforce toward producing more food," insists your Minister of Food Distribution, sitting in the corner and sharpening a sickle. "If we don't want our citizens to starve, we must move them into agricultural communes and put every shoulder to the wheel, regardless of profession, age or ability. By sharing tools, grain and livestock we can offset this disaster as soon as possible. Sure, it'll be hard manual work, but at least our comrades will be nourished."

2. "We must assure our populace that everything is going to plan," says your Minister of Propaganda, brushing dust from your desk into a jar of kvass. "Just keep the shelves stocked by using cheap fillers in our food for a while, and don't let factory staff tell anyone. I'm not suggesting sawdust here; just add extra water, and bulk food with a little chalk or alum. Try some tea made with thrice-recycled leaves!" He presses the lukewarm cup into your hands.

*3. "You know, I've heard that smoking helps people eat less," states your brother, who smells subtly of burnt dignity. "Ergo, we should encourage everyone to take up the habit. We could even add extra appetite suppressants to cigarettes and promote images of the scrawny, smoking socialist to help them ignore their stomachs." [[color=blue]Smoking is legal[/color]]

*4. "You know, I've heard from some East Lebatuckese pals that smoking helps people eat less," whispers your brother, who smells subtly of burnt dignity. "Ergo, we wouldn't have this problem if we legalized smoking and encouraged everyone to take up the habit. We could even add extra appetite suppressants and call them [i]Comrade's Choice[/i]." [[color=red]Smoking is illegal[/color]]

5. "The true socialist is independent," shouts your Minister of Agriculture from outside your window, where he is hammering chicken mesh to a fencepost. "From each according to his ability, to each according to his ability. We should make everyone grow their own stinkin' food. Good comrades don't sponge off of the system, at others' expense. We shouldn't have to worry about freak logistics problems. If everyone rose or fell, ate or starved, alone and entirely on their own merits, we'd all be truly equal."

1. "Drugs are bad, mmkay," says @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Emkay, holding a sign that says the same thing. "I love the Pangaoaoangans, but the peyote thing is a problem. Drugs ruin lives. All drugs, mmkay? They should swap something else in. Instead of peyote they could use, say, potato. Sounds almost the same, and doesn't hurt anyone."

2. Chief Hoogahooga, leader of the Pangaoaoangan tribe, takes a long draught of his peace pipe before speaking with you. "Lo, don't you want to allow the people living in your country to practice their religion freely? We do no harm, and peyote is not addictive. Peyote brings sacred visions that guide my people, and it is impossible to practice my religion and heed the words of the spirits without this all-natural, all-herbal, plant-based substance. Please, @@LEADER@@, allow a special exception for drug use when part of traditional faith ceremonies."

3. "Peyote comes from cactuses, right? If we get rid of the cactuses, then no more problem!" suggests your Minister of Babies and Bathwater, sparking a furious debate amongst your aides regarding the correct pluralisation of cactus. "There's a whole bunch of fungal diseases and mealybugs that we can seed across the deserts and mountains — the problem will soon be gone."

A combination of careful merging of bloodlines, a small number of "accidental falls down spiral staircases" and sheer luck has left many of your vassals with a single shared heir, who is now poised to become the most powerful landowner in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "I don't see the need for discontent," says Duke Rich R. Daffird, the heir in question, hunching petulantly. "Providence and the rightful law of the land have put me in line to inherit. If a man were to inherit a horse... yes, a horse... you would not take it away, would you? Well, my fiefdom is as a horse. And is my pedigree not noble enough? My mother came from House @@ANIMAL@@ and my grandmother was a princess of Barria, after all. Instead, let us be friends, and let a glorious summer of alliance between near-equals begin."

We must divert these inheritances away from this meddlesome Duke! Forge charters! Hire assassins to murder him in his sleep! Do whatever must be done!"

3. "There is a third option here," suggests courtier and serial womaniser Bors S. Jonson. "Ask yourself: why do so many of your vassals have a single heir? Because of the way inheritance laws work. Instead, assert that all progeny inherit equally, regardless of relative age and the circumstances of their conception, and the whole problem will soon be divided and conquered."

During a rousing homily last week, clergyperson Ziggy Stardust called upon you to spread the message of @@FAITH@@ into outer space.

The Debate
1. "Fix your soul on this!" exclaims Ziggy, sporting glittery shoes and extravagant makeup. "There are billions of stars, planets, and things to explore above our heads! Surely the Creator that made all the stuff up there intended for us to marvel at it, not only from a distance, but with our own hands and feet! What use is a gift that we refuse to understand? @@NAME@@ must aid @@FAITH@@ to become a truly interplanetary religion; we can witness to the East Lebatuckese and Dàguó astronauts, and whoever else might be listening. I can't wait for the moon to become part of my diocese."

2. "Absolutely not," frets your Minister of Repeating the Past, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Don't you know how this ends? One nation decides they need to visit the moon for ideological reasons, and suddenly every nation does! We can't afford to be drawn into a space race with nations like Dàguó or East Lebatuck. Besides, there are plenty of earthly problems to solve before we deal with the heavenly ones."

3. "I agree," pipes in your paranoid military advisor. "We can't allow the past to repeat itself. So when we send these devotees to the moon, they must be equipped with the best weaponry and escorted by the best military force that we can afford. There are several nations and radical cults that would be content to blow us out of the sky before we reach the moon. A good offense is the best defense."

4. "We can't have special-interest groups blasting off the planet whenever they feel like it," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, glaring disdainfully at Ziggy's outfit. "But it might not be a bad idea to have an official @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Astronaut Corps.

The Issue
A recent survey suggested that more than half of the nation's teenagers have accessed websites designated only for users 18 years or older.

The Debate
1. "I caught the lil' ones looking at this!" booms a concerned grandfather, attempting to show you some graphic images on his phone. "The new techmologies only promote disgusting, dangerous acts. And back in my day, young people had to work very hard to get their hands on pornography. Nowadays, these entitled, bratty kids have it so easy: they can just click a button and — boom — orgies!

"Imagine how much of a bad parent you have to be to let your child be able to see such depraved garbage.

The parents who facilitate this kind of behavior must be held legally responsible for corrupting the youth."

5. "The root of this problem is the accessibility of these websites," claims your IT support technician Nathan Feilder, restarting your computer again. "Why not implement internet-wide filters for adult websites? Only users who have verified their age to the government through their ID and other documents may get past these barriers.

Following a fracas between the Minister of Paternalism, the Minister of Patriotism and the Minister of Patchouli, your inner circle has gathered to discuss how best to run your nation's most recently acquired colony.

The Debate
1. "The best approach is through direct rule, of course," chortles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, slamming @@HIS@@ hunting crop against the table so your secretary startles. "That accursed continent needs intelligent and honourable people — like myself — to teach those childlike natives. A colonial administration, staffed entirely by our people, will look after them and teach them good @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ values. When they see what great civilisation our pioneers bring to them, they won't be so upset that we mowed down a few hundred primitive shacks for our five-star clubhouse and gated communities. They'll see it was just common sense."

2. "Having a government there comprised entirely of native @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ will breed resentment among the indigenous population," groans Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, adjusting @@HIS/HER@@ @@CAPITAL@@ University cap. "Why don't we co-opt their elite instead? Just educate them in our best schools and universities — for example's sake, @@CAPITALINITIALS@@U — to value our culture and customs over their own.

*4. "You're thinking too small," barks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who visited the colony once and now claims to know everything about the area.

5. "Or we could just forget the whole thing," suggests your weary Secretary of the Treasury, as she stares at a globe with a magnifying glass. "I mean, armies tromp around, claiming land for @@NAME@@ without any thought of the consequences. Do you have any idea how much it costs to maintain a colony? Resources are stretched thin as it is. Taxpayers at home don't want to be subsidising a place they can't even point out on a map, and the colonies don't want to be subsidised. Besides, imperialism is so old-fashioned.

1. "These lowlifes have absolutely no regard for this nation's proud figures of authority!" bellows your torch-carrying Minister of Culture and National Heritage, stomping angrily on a recreated photo of the both of you.

"Ensure the sufferers get the best possible care at our hospitals, so they can live their last days with dignity.

2. "Why dearie, we'd be outta business!" pipes up the proprietor of Mrs. Lovett's Pies, placing some piping hot pies on some plates. "The easiest solution to this kuru thing is to ban brains in food.

*1. "The one-child policy is doomed to fail," declares eco-feminist Freida Kidds, ignoring the crying baby in a hessian sling on her back. "How do you expect us to have only one child when you don't even give us the means to control our family sizes? It's not like contraception is one hundred percent effective.

Last weekend, every single participant in the Annual @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Freshwater Fishing Competition was arrested for angling in violation of environmental laws. A large group of furious fishermen and outraged officials have forced their way upstream into your office, hoping that you'll go for their argument hook, line, and sinker.

The Debate
1. "The law says we must pay an insane amount for fishing licenses, which we all did," grumbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, five-time winner of the competition. "The law says each person can only keep a dozen @@ANIMAL@@fish per day, which we all did. The law says we can only fish in rivers and streams, which we were all doing. We go by the book and follow all of your inane laws, and yet you still arrest the lot of us! We demand that you let us off the hook, and free fishing while you're at it. Remove all the hoops to jump through, and we'll get along swimmingly."

2. "Don't listen to those hoodlums; they know full well what they were doing," growls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Waterway Nomenclature. "Our laws say that fishing is allowed in rivers, streams, and inlets. However, these delinquents were fishing in the north fork of the @@ANIMAL@@ River, which — as we all know — is a branch. And the law clearly states that fishing in brooks, tributaries, branches, and creeks is illegal. It's really quite simple, @@LEADER@@, yet people always deny that they are in the wrong. We need much harsher punishments for violations of environmental regulations to deter this abhorrent lawlessness."

3. "Actually, it isn't quite that simple," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Estuaries, Deltas, Forks, and Convergences. "You can try to slap labels on all you want, but @@NAME@@'s hydrological system is incredibly complex and interconnected. Where exactly does @@CAPITAL@@ Stream turn into @@CAPITAL@@ Creek?

The nation's strict immigration standards prevent foreigners from becoming citizens without proper education in the nation's culture and history. However, a recent study shows that many natural-born @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ could not pass the same exam.

The Debate
1. "I don't see why we need to hold immigrants to a different standard than native citizens," says test administrator Charles Clean, looking up the weather on the day of the nation's founding for question 376. "We ought to treat everyone in @@NAME@@ the same and make them take the citizenship exam when they reach the age of majority. If they fail, they can be sent to whatever country their family originated from. If we can't find it, just send them to Bigtopia; I hear they could use some cheap labor."

2. "Just let everyone in," mumbles the laziest customs officer, Ingrid Jones, who is doing a crossword in the corner. "It's too much work — I mean, it's silly to hold them to a standard that isn't there. Just have them pass a basic background check to make sure they're hopefully not an Ultra-Violetist nutjob or serial jaywalker, then grant citizenship to them and their descendants. If it's good enough for @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, it should be good enough for everyone else."

3. "Don't listen to that idiot," counters nationalist speaker Michael Rabin, recently named 'Most Eloquent' in the Jingoists' Choice Awards. "If a person has @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ blood, then they're kin and we have a duty to protect their precious lives. The only immigrants we should allow in are those that can contribute, so they ought to take the tests on entry. And since the children of immigrants won't have @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ blood, they'll have to take the test too. Families should be proud if one of them passes and can live here."

4. "There's no need to address this so harshly," asserts high school teacher Sonequa Wonka, writing an incomprehensible pictorial equation on the wall. "If we increase funding on education, with a focus on civics, there won't be any more of these ignoramuses. Then the immigrants will have a fair standard to live up to. We could even offer free classes to would-be citizens to help them prepare for the test. A little education never hurt anyone."

As you walk to your office building, the furore outside is almost as loud as the award buzz.

The Debate
1. "I don't want homeschooling to be associated with these irresponsible ideologues who brainwash their credulous kiddos!" huffs homeschooling mother @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, stopping you to shove a science text in your face, open at a page depicting a purple dinosaur doing a backstroke and titled [i]How the [u]Real[/u] Nessa Lake Creature Disproves Evilution[/i]. "Register us all centrally, vet us regularly and send all kids whose parents fail back to school. Test our children in all academic subjects, even critical thinking. People will soon see that many homeschoolers are competent."

2. "That 'documentary' is a liberal hatchet job!" Documentary participant Jiminy Jehoshaphat Rutter, a father of 13 children whose names all begin with a J, stomps up to you. "Parents know their unique progeny better than the state, or some 'filmmaker'. At home, I can teach my kids our religion without some Cyanist coming to serve rice with saffron and pomegranate and tell my babies about some 'Festivaqua' feast day! Uphold a parent's unrestricted right to homeschool; no nannying checks.

3. "Dear Violet, no!" gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the former educator of Mr. Rutter's triplets — Jinny, Jilly and Jenny — as @@HE@@ runs behind him. "Mr. Rutter's children must have rights, too: the right to an education that prepares them for [i]any[/i] life they'd choose. To protect children, all homeschooling must be banned.

The Issue
A man picked up a transgender woman at a bar and brought her home, where he subsequently murdered her, beating her to death. In the ensuing court case, his lawyer argued a "trans panic" defense: the shock of realizing he had inadvertently picked up a trans woman sent his client temporarily criminally insane, rendering him irresponsible for his actions. The jury agreed, acquitting him of all charges.

The Debate
1. "This is an outrage!" cries the prosecuting attorney @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while slamming the court records on your desk and then writing 'OUTRAGE' in big letters with a red sharpie on the first page. "We cannot let defense lawyers play to the prejudices of the juries. Would we tolerate this if it was suggested someone went insane because they picked up a Bigtopian woman? Outlaw the practice of defense lawyers using sexuality and gender identity of the victim as mitigating factors."

2. Defense attorney @@RANDOM_NAME@@ storms into your office and silently mimes yelling while wildly gesticulating; finally, @@HE@@ actually speaks. "Sorry about that, but you were thinking of taking away my ability to speak freely while defending my clients. My client was already suffering from depression and a thyroid problem and the transgender nature of the victim provides critical context to the defendant's mental state at the time of the murder. What sort of pertinent information will you outlaw defense attorneys from presenting next? In the end you have to trust juries to decide what's a legitimate defense argument and what's not."

3. "@@HE@@ kind of has a point," notes LGBT activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while affixing a sticker of a rainbow-colored @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ flag to your desk. "The problem is that there's so much latent bias among @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ that juries fall for this tripe.

After a flashbang grenade was thrown through his bedroom window and his front door was smashed open, National Rocket-launcher Association member Karl Rolfe reached for his legally-owned semi-automatic shotgun, intending to defend his home, and shot the first intruder he saw breaking into his house. Unfortunately for him, the intruder was a police officer, actioning a no-knock warrant at the head of a SWAT team. Later, it was found that the warrant was issued on bad information, based on a fabricated set of terrorism allegations by a vindictive ex-lover.

The Debate
1. "They called me a cop-killer!" weeps Rolfe, now sporting a black eye, a broken arm and multiple taser burns. "I'm a law-abiding citizen! I love the police; they're the good guys! I swear, that's what I've always believed. The problem is these no-knock warrants being issued too easily — I blame the lack of safeguards, not these fine upstanding officers who are victims as much as I am! A system that requires a higher standard of evidence before issuing no-knock warrants, that's what we need. Oh gods, please don't send me back to that cell... Please."

2. "Look, no-knock warrants are broadly useful tools of enforcement," rebuts police officer Preeti Freedom, lovingly stroking the butt of her rifle. "They actually reduce the risk of violence because we can normally act before perps get a chance to prepare any defence. Besides, we shouted 'POLICE!' just before we kicked his door in. Not our fault if he was disorientated at the time. I reckon he knew he was shooting a cop, and should be prosecuted for it."

3. "I never expected anyone to get shot," pouts the ex who made the false allegations, wearing an expression of hurt innocence. "I just wanted Karl to have a shock in the middle of the night, like I did that time he staggered home at 2 am and threw up on my pillow. For that, he deserved a rude awakening of his own! I think maybe people should be allowed to have guns, but should only be allowed to use them for their jobs or in the firing range. Idiotic use of firearms for so-called self-defence is just macho posturing, and someone always gets hurt with macho posturing. Get rid of the home defence laws!"

4. "People don't kill people, guns do!" wails weeping liberal Yoshi Ford, oblivious to the fact that his histrionically-waving arms have just knocked one of your aides out of a third-floor window. "Not only should private citizens not have guns, but the police shouldn't have guns either! In fact, I'm not even sure soldiers should carry guns!

"By charging ridiculous levels of compound interest, they put their users deeper and deeper into debt!

If the fees were dealt with as a civil matter, like when people fail to pay their energy bills, debt collectors would be able to seize property to pay the debt."

4. "Why don't we fund the  @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE_INITIALS@@BC out of general taxation instead?" yawns an under-depreciated junior Treasury minister, who is finding this funding discussion rather taxing. "That way, the broadcaster gets the money it needs, no one has to pay an expensive license fee and no one goes to prison or have their property seized. Everyone's going to benefit, well, except for the taxpayers, but it's accrual world after all. Anyways, I'd really appreciate it if you'd let me defer my role in this discussion. Calc-you-later."

5. "A license fee to watch TV? Public funding? What are we, East Lebatuckese?" questions billionaire media mogul RuPaul Murmarina, the owner of @@ANIMAL@@ News. "Forcing people to pay an archaic institution for supposedly impartial news and educational content is nonsense. I say privatise the broadcaster and let the free market do what it does best: meet the needs of the people by telling them what to think."

[b][anchor=1366]#1366[/anchor]: Parklife [Pythaga; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
Public parks all across @@NAME@@ are in shambles, with sports fields overgrown and playgrounds rusting themselves to pieces, all due to a lack of sufficient funding. While the upper-crust of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ society have taken to funding and operating their own parks on private property, large segments of urban populations have been left recreationally disenfranchised. A plethora of interested parties are demanding that you take a swing at the problem.

The Debate
1. "This clearly shows that private enterprise is much better at running parks than your government," boasts wealthy gut lord @@RANDOM_NAME@@, parked in your chair with @@HIS@@ feet on your table. "How about you put all of the public parks up for auction? Then they'll finally be competently managed, complete with well-maintained grounds and top-tier facilities. It would provide the public with a sense of enormous well-being, for what the free market deems a fair price."

2. "But think of the disadvantaged children!" bemoans annoyingly noble single parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If all parks are made private, those heinous entry fees would mean I couldn't even afford to get in! It simply isn't fair that so many youngsters can't safely run around outside, so instead you must use government funds to restore our public recreational spaces. That way every child has an equal playing field, and then we'd be happy for the rest of our days, safe in the knowledge there will always be a bit of @@NAME@@ devoted to us."

3. "But that alone is not enough!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your neighbourhood dustman and part-time socialist, while waving a 'Parks for the Proletariat' poster in your face. "Public space is scarce, and you cannot continue to allow the upper-class to eat from their gold-plated picnic tables in their gated gardens. Take the lands those posh parks inhabit, and make them free to enjoy for all the people. From the hands of the rich, to walking hand-in-hand. That is the proper parklife."

The Issue
Recent studies show childhood obesity is on the rise, and many believe this to be the fault of attention-grabbing packaging on sugary foods.

The Debate
1. "How are we supposed to keep our children healthy when all of their favorite cartoon characters are shown brazenly endorsing these products?" screams angry mother Michelle Cash. "Children who can't readily distinguish reality from fiction are tricked into thinking they need these products to be like their heroes! We mothers demand that packaging should never be designed to influence the minds of children! We demand plain and informative packaging!"

2. "Come now, surely people can be trusted to make their own decisions?" purrs fat-cat CEO Anthony Tyger. "Besides, you could argue that being exposed to advertising at an early age trains young people to be discerning consumers. It's a form of real-life education. Trust instead in industry self-regulation, and keep government out of it. That'd be gr-r-reat!"

3. "I think the fact that this is an issue in the first place speaks volumes about the way we see larger people!" cries your morbidly obese Minister of Compassion, weeping as she munches on a bowl of frosted Happios cereal. "Why can't we allow people to be whatever shape they are without ostracism? Let bigger kids be bigger kids, and if anyone criticizes their weight, that should be deemed illegal hate speech!"

[b][anchor=1368]#1368[/anchor]: Parking Hell [Genbu Kaiden; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
The new director of the @@CAPITAL@@ Department of Transportation has suggested that imposing dynamic parking prices might help ease the city centre's nightmarish congestion. Because the national government owns large parts of the capital, the plan cannot proceed without your approval.

The Debate
1. Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was formerly a professor of urban planning, pushes up his glasses. "Dynamic parking prices will mean that not only will drivers have to pay for parking, but that the prices will change throughout the day based on the location's demand. For example, drivers will pay more to park during busy periods. This will encourage motorists to park in quieter areas and not hog the same spot for hours on end. Take notes, there will be a quiz next week— er, sorry, force of habit there."

2. "This isn't a game of Maxopoly where the 'free parking' space gives a windfall of revenue!" complains the Minister of Labor, who's just come from a marathon six-hour session of said game. "This plan will punish the working poor who can ill afford parking fees. If the city wants to deal with congestion, then it should start building more underground tunnels and parking garages with your help. Free parking is the right of every citizen, and you can't start charging me — I mean, the miserably poor — for parking."

3. "This plan is too complicated," says the laconic Minister of Gordian Knots, who arrived in an ox cart and is now snipping at the air with a pair of scissors. "But doing nothing is not an option. Let us ban cars from the city instead. Stops congestion. Keeps things simple."

[b][anchor=1369]#1369[/anchor]: Negotiation Complication [Westinor; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
For the past few months, your administration has been working on a landmark trade deal with the historically hostile nation of Blackacre. On the eve of the agreement's planned signing, Georgia Mormont — a high-ranking official from the Blackacrean government — has approached you with the intent to defect.

The Debate
1. "If we upset the Blackacreans, months of planning could go to waste!" whispers your suspicious Minister of Pragmatism as she glares at the visibly trembling Blackacrean advisor. "Blackacre would never allow their Chief of Staff to defect! We have to turn her away and report this to Blackacre. It may be cold, but I stand — I mean, [i]we[/i] stand to make a lot from this trade deal. This agreement could be the path to a long-lasting peace between our two nations — don't let a single defector stand in our way."

2. "@@LEADER@@, please don't abandon me!" quietly pleads Mormont, as she pulls you into a secluded corner of the room. "I'm almost absolutely sure that they've discovered my intentions to defect by now. If you don't protect me, the secret police will be sure to 'disappear' me. Let me stay and I will give you valuable information that you could use against Blackacre. Trade deals might be valuable, but trust me, the secrets I know are worth so much more. Want to know where their secret nuclear missile launch sites are? Yes, I thought you would..."

3. "I agree that they'd never let her defect," comments your shady Intelligence Minister, as he escorts you out of the room. "Which is why I'm surprised she's here — the Blackacrean Supreme Leader keeps close watch on all of her subordinates. She must have been sent here to spy on us, but that's fine. We'll feed her dirty intel, track her communications, and who knows? We could find ourselves a spy network, right here in @@NAME@@. I'm sure you'll agree this is the best course of action, hmm?"

The Issue
After several avoidable deaths were blamed on the incompetent medical advice of "@@RANDOM_NAME@@ MD", an individual operating from a shady office on the outskirts of @@CAPITAL@@, investigation revealed that @@HE@@ was using the letters MD without possessing a medical license, nor indeed any form of qualification.

The Debate
1. "I never lied to anybody!" wheedles the accused individual over the phone, from the bunker where @@HE@@ has gone into hiding. "I never said I was a Medical Doctor, and I didn't post any signs calling my office a clinic. In fact, obviously, the initials stand for Managing Director. I merely gave advice to whomever happened to come by, and they paid me for my wisdom! Is it a crime to be wrong? Whatever happened to free speech?"

2. "My diagnosis: misuse of post-nominal letters. The prescription: board certification!" pontificates Doctor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the @@NAME@@ Medical Association, while scribbling illegibly in a notepad. "There are professional associations for nearly all reputable occupations: MDs, CPAs, even the lawyers with their cute little 'Esq.' title! You must require that an individual be certified by a proper professional association before using any kind of letters after their name, for the public's sake."

3. "I agree that we need credentialing, but the government ought to handle it," opines A@@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Deputy Minister for Expanding Bureaucracy. "Can we really trust private groups to handle membership fairly? That's just begging for corruption and nepotism. We'll set standards that will be the same all across @@NAME@@, and the paper trail we create — signed in triplicate and filed appropriately — will ensure we know exactly who is allowed to call themselves what!"

*4. "Occupational titles?" asks your protocol assistant, straightening his cravat. "Oh no, what the government needs is some new titles of its own, to recognize citizens that have served us well! Imagine — the @@LEADER@@ Medal of Freedom! The @@NAME@@ Legion of Merit! Maybe even bring back knighthoods and earldoms and duchies? That's how you show some appreciation! Those are the only post-nominals that should be allowed, and the only ones that matter!" [[color=purple]Must not have Feudalism[/color]]

*5. "Occupational titles?" gasps Aldo Johnson, @@CAPITAL@@ King of Arms, clutching at his badge of office. "How ghastly!

A low-level bureaucrat was recently found murdered after rejecting a retired homeowner's request for a construction permit. During the subsequent court case, the homeowner admitted that @@HE@@ found their address in the public voter rolls, which has shed light on the security threat that they may pose, especially to government officials.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, we are all in danger!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a bureaucrat in the Department of Administration, who has not left the building since the trial. "Any psychotic Pizza Cultist can go down to City Hall and get all of my personal information with no repercussions! I cannot possibly imagine being able to continue in my position without an escort at all times. It may be expensive, but can you really justify price over a murder, all because I rejected someone's request to build an airstrip in their backyard?"

2. "We are incapable of assigning security to every paper-pusher who works in @@CAPITAL@@," sighs Chief of Police @@RANDOM_NAME@@, taking a black marker to some recently filed incident reports. "Why not clamp down on the accessibility of voter rolls by restricting public access to groups that actually use them, such as political parties and researchers?

"If some rookie cop slips up, I should be able to take them to court! Not that I've done anything wrong, of course.

The Issue
Traditionally, clubs in the Football League have been sponsored by such entities as Cheesemongers Unlimited, Chairs 'n' Stuff, and Sharp 'n' Pointy Things Incorporated. Recently, however, many big-name clubs have struck deals with corporations representing such seedy nations as Althaniq, Blackacre, and the United Federation.

The Debate
1. "Hey hey, ho ho, Althaniq has got to go!" shout the ultra fans of @@CAPITAL@@ United, a club that is now under Althaniq's ownership. Their leader, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, continues through a megaphone: "We are all ordinary football fans and we deserve to have a voice in how our club runs! Greedy interests like Althaniq don't care about us; they only care about @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@, and hiding their grotesque human rights record by using their clubs as PR! For the fairness and equity of our sport, we implore you to enact a policy that allows us fans to own the majority of our club's shares and voting rights!"

2. "What are these fair-weather fans talking about?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of Althaniq Sports Investments. "Don't they want their team to become the best in @@NAME@@ and in the Football Association of @@REGION@@? We buy @@CAPITAL@@ United all the best players, such as Leonard Messy and Christian Goataldo, yet our fans treat us like crap! Leave the free market in football, and we promise you that the results will make both our nations proud."

3. "Hmm... if our enemies want to play this game, I suggest we join them on the pitch!" says your unconventional Minister of Intelligence and Sports. "If Althaniq, Blackacre, and the United Federation own our biggest football clubs to promote their interests, we need to promote our interests and propaganda in their countries by doing the same thing!

[b][anchor=1373]#1373[/anchor]: You Should Have (Copy)Left My Software Alone! [SherpDaWerp; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
For once, a government program has been a hit, with the new YourGov app giving citizens unified access to all their important government services. But some @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, concerned with the storage of their personal data on government servers, have decompiled the app. These privacy advocates have discovered that large portions of the code rely on restrictive "copyleft" software libraries written in the United Federation.

The Debate
1. "I created those libraries for the good of the world, and you selfish @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ jerks used them without following the terms!" yells Ganondorf Ungar, sniffling his nose as he tries to wipe boogers on your table surreptitiously. "It says right here in the software license: all derivative works must be released under the same open-source license, so you're committing a copyright violation by not giving out your code! Release your code and comply with the license, then maybe, just maybe, I won't take your government to some international court and sue for everything you've got!"

2. "Whoa, now hold on there," interjects lead YourGov developer Lucina Claus, who likes to go with the integer overflow. "Yeah... okay, we might possibly have used, ah, just a couple of those libraries that the kid wrote. But for us to comply with this "Wildebeest" license he's talking about, we would have to make our code open source! Imagine the security risk if Dàguó hackers were able to access our systems by using the publicly available source code! It's unreasonable to expect us to comply with these terms — you need to exempt the government from overreaching copyleft licenses in the name of security!"

3. "The problem here isn't the license or the code, it's that people found out!" whispers a shady looking individual, the brim of whose black hat is tilted to obscure his face. "@@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ who decompile the code are a security risk themselves — just like any malicious hacker. We need to obfuscate all of the code, only allow trusted developers access, and forbid members of the public from tinkering with it. Anyone who tries to probe government infrastructure obviously has hostile intentions, and we need to treat them that way!"

4. "Pretty sure that's an unconscionable breach of our civil rights," responds Sancho Jones, who found the copied code, as he desperately tries to conceal a Guy Fawkes mask. "We have a right to know what we're installing on our computers — any software that you want us to download should always be open source, including the ones that you code in house! Just think how much better these applications would be if all of @@NAME@@ could provide input? True @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ programs, made by the people, for the people!"

The Issue
A high-speed police pursuit ended in disaster last night when the suspect suddenly lost control of her vehicle and swerved into incoming traffic, triggering a fatal pileup. The deadly chase has raised questions regarding whether pursuits on the nation's roadways are worth the danger they present to the public.

The Debate
1. "Let's cut to the chase," suggests roadway safety official Bella Swallows. "Evidence shows that police pursuits present an unacceptable risk to the general public and drive @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ into their graves! A national no-pursuit policy should be adopted, with reasonable exceptions when authorized by a senior police officer. After all, there's no point in running down the guilty if the innocent are collateral damage."

2. "If cops can't tail thugs then why even have police cars?" oinks the rotund @@CAPITAL@@ Police Chief, channeling her frustration into your desk with a truncheon. "Besides, you'd be letting lawbreaking lowlifes escape! LEOs should instead be extensively trained in PIT, TPAC, and TVI against GTAs, TWOC, and perps DUI, to prevent IRTCs and RTAs. If criminals know escape is impossible, then maybe they won't run to begin with. Do it ASAP!"

3. "Nobody can escape a traffic jam!" declares the Interim Director of Infrastructure, Oversight, and Traffic at the Transportation Ministry. "Roadway congestion near vehicle pursuits can be easily created and manipulated by altering traffic lights or closing roads, ensnaring evasive goons in bumper-to-bumper backups, which all but guarantees quick apprehension by police. Motorists might not appreciate being made into unwitting roadblocks, but why care? If you ask me, the only thing more despicable than a bottleneck is a criminal!"

Once again, the cruel hand of obligation has dragged you to the G20,000 Summit, an annual gathering of nations great and small. You are currently stuck in the evening social mixer, where one wrong word to a rival nation's representatives can quickly escalate to hostilities. Unfortunately, several dignitaries appear keen on talking to you.

The Debate
*1. "There you are! We haven't spoken in ages," enthuses Chancellor Kurt Zahmahkibo of Smalltopia. "I hate to ask for your help, but I have a bit of a conundrum. I'm sure you have heard that East Lebatuck, our largest neighbor, has become rather menacing and hostile recently. Their military has been conducting frequent 'training exercises' right next to the border. The next thing you know, they'll be storming our cities with their tanks!

*2. "There you are! We haven't spoken in ages," enthuses "Doc" Moreno, the President for Life of the socialist island nation of San Vitenzo. "I hate to ask for your help, but I have a bit of a conundrum. I'm sure you have heard that the United Federation, our closest neighbor, has become rather menacing and hostile recently. Their navy has been conducting frequent 'training exercises' in our own territorial waters. The next thing you know, they'll be landing on our shores with their tanks! To be blunt, we need protection from these fascist pigs. Would it be possible to station some of your nuclear weapons in our country?" [[color=red]Must be Socialist[/color]]

**3. Before you can respond, you hear a shout from the nearby bar. "Hey, it's the Head Honcho of @@NAME@@! How's it going?" exclaims Smalltopia's Air Chief Marshall Diego Fufu, who seems to see this sort of gathering as an excuse to get uproariously drunk. "Did the Boss Man tell you about our proposal to borrow some of your nukes? You know, if you really wanted to protect us, why don't you just give us the launch codes after sending over your missiles? That way, we'd both be able to unleash destruction upon anyone who threatened us... including those vulgar Maxtopians." [[color=blue]Must be Capitalist[/color]]

"However, Chancellor Zahmahkibo has a point. The commie parasites need to be kept in check.

[b][anchor=1376]#1376[/anchor]: [color=#CE532A][i]MADness:[/i][/color] From East Lebatuck With Love [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Story So Far
A few months have passed since the G20,000 Summit, where you agreed to station some of your nuclear weapons in Smalltopia to aid in their defense against the forces of communism.

The Issue
Today was supposed to be a calm day. The issues on your desk this morning were even more trivial than usual. Of course, that's how it always goes. Your Minister of Intelligence, known only as 'N', suddenly bursts into your office with an armful of surveillance photos. "@@LEADER@@, we've discovered an urgent problem. The nearby island nation of San Vitenzo — a backward, communist hellhole — has suddenly become a buzzing hive of activity. East Lebatuck has covertly brought a shipment of nuclear missiles to the island and is setting them up as we speak. Yes, we put some of our own missiles in Smalltopia — but we're the good guys! They have no right to threaten us! I'm sending in secret agent James Bont to deal with the situation. Of course, we will need to attack this problem on all fronts, so I have invited our colleagues from some of the... less interesting government ministries to discuss a few additional options."

The Debate
1. Without any hesitation, Defense Minister Mack Rimera marches into your office and drops a stack of reports into your lap. "We can't afford to let East Lebatuck put our citizens in mortal danger! Those commies only respect power and violence. If we send our warships to blockade San Vitenzo, this will allow us to project a show of force, while also preventing additional shipments of missiles or enemy troops from reaching the island. Do you agree?"

2. "Perhaps a calmer reply would produce better results," suggests Minister of International Diplomacy Maureen Dusk, who walks in with the acoustic guitar that she is infamous for carrying around at all times. "The missiles are definitely a threat, but they're not yet capable of firing them from San Vitenzo. We have a limited window of opportunity to solve things peacefully. What if we suggested some sort of diplomatic summit between our three nations? It couldn't hurt to ask."

[b][anchor=1377]#1377[/anchor]: [color=#CE532A][i]MADness:[/i][/color] For @@LEADER@@'s Ears Only [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Secret agent James Bont has been sent to San Vitenzo with orders to infiltrate the missile installation sites.

The Issue
As you are heading toward yet another meeting, you receive a phone call from N, your Minister of Intelligence, who has news from James Bont and needs to speak with you about his mission.

The Debate
1. "Good morning, boss," proclaims the steady voice of your spy chief. "Bont reported that he was able to steal a missile technician's uniform and security badge that may allow him to enter the enemy bases undetected. However, there's been a small... complication. We believe that one or more enemy agents are aware of his presence. They're probably too dangerous to ignore. Do you want to give Bont a free hand to neutralize the threat? A few bullets should take care of... wait, did you hear that clicking sound? I hope this phone isn't bugged. Code Blue, @@LEADER@@." N hangs up, leaving you bewildered.

2. After staring at your phone for a few seconds, you feel your right shoe vibrating as blue text starts scrolling across the toe: "Alternatively, if you're uncomfortable with extrajudicial killings, you could order Bont to capture any enemy spies and hand them off to us for interrogation. It's riskier than just shooting them — our enemies may have set up a trap that could result in Bont's death — but we might be able to gain valuable intel or use prisoners as a negotiating tool."

3. While still thinking it over, you're suddenly interrupted by cooing coming from an open window. A carrier pigeon alights on your shoulder and presents a small note tied to its right leg: "There's a third way of dealing with this. If you want, you could instruct Bont to simply ignore the enemy agents and focus on his primary mission. This might just be a diversion to waste our time and allow East Lebatuck to finish installing their missiles. Well, let me know of your decision by this evening. PS: This message will self-destruct in ten seconds."

* These options also appear as 3, 4, 5 according to internal numbering. They appear to be the same wording as the internally numbered options 0, 1, and 2 as stated above. [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=38016221#p38016221]Source.[/url]

**6. "No! That could escalate to war — and it would all be our fault!" shouts Maureen Dusk, who had been plucking a few notes of 'Born in @@NAME@@' on her guitar. "Keep the blockade in place and demand that the enemy stay back, but order our navy to take no action unless they're directly attacked. Stopping East Lebatuck's cargo shipments isn't worth our sailors' lives." [TBD]

The Story So Far
East Lebatuck's convoy confronted your naval blockade of San Vitenzo.

The Issue
The enemy ships have turned back, in compliance with your demands. However, your surveillance of the island now shows that the nuclear missiles that were already on San Vitenzo are almost ready for deployment.

The Debate
1. "They were just using the standoff as a delaying tactic!" yells Defense Minister Mack Rimera, throwing his notes across the room in a barely restrained fury. "While we were pointing our guns at each other, East Lebatuck was biding its time until their doomsday weapons were ready. We only have a few days before they are able to launch. It's imperative that we send our air force to bomb the missile sites — and we must do it now!"

2. "Don't forget that we still have James Bont over there," reminds Intelligence Minister N, who had been whispering to a young woman in the corner. "My assistant, Ms. Evelyn Cashcent, tells me that Agent Bont has made significant progress at infiltrating the enemy bases. There's a good chance that he will be able to sabotage the missile launch equipment, if those are your orders. The only downside is that we don't know how long this might take."

3. "It's still not too late for negotiations," claims Minister of International Diplomacy Maureen Dusk, playing an anguished version of the '@@ANIMAL@@ Blues' on her guitar. "If there's any possibility of a non-violent solution, we have to pursue it. However, if we're going to have some sort of diplomatic summit to work out our differences, this is almost certainly our last opportunity. If we let it slip away... things could get rather grim."

The Story So Far
East Lebatuck's convoy confronted your naval blockade of San Vitenzo.

The Issue
The enemy ships refused to comply with your demands. A submarine bearing the red star of East Lebatuck brazenly torpedoed your lead warship, causing it to sink into the Gulf of Talkin. Your remaining blockade ships opened fire, destroying most of the convoy. Unfortunately, a cargo freighter was able to slip past the carnage and deliver more missiles and supplies to their operation on San Vitenzo.

The Debate
1. "This is an act of war!" yells Defense Minister Mack Rimera, throwing his notes across the room in a barely restrained fury. "Even worse, we only have a few days before they are able to launch. It's imperative that we send our air force to bomb the missile sites — and we must do it now!"

2. "Don't forget that we still have James Bont over there," reminds Intelligence Minister N, who had been whispering to a young woman in the corner. "My assistant, Ms. Evelyn Cashcent, tells me that Agent Bont has made significant progress at infiltrating the enemy bases. There's a good chance that he will be able to sabotage the missile launch equipment, if those are your orders. The only downside is that we don't know how long this might take."

3. "We shouldn't have let the situation devolve into armed conflict," states Minister of International Diplomacy Maureen Dusk, playing an anguished version of the '@@ANIMAL@@ Blues' on her guitar. "If there's any possibility of ending the violence, we have to pursue it. However, if we're going to have some sort of diplomatic summit to work out our differences, this is almost certainly our last opportunity. If we let it slip away... things could get rather grim."

[b][anchor=1381]#1381[/anchor]: [color=#CE532A][i]MADness:[/i][/color] Chairman No [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Story So Far
You have called for a meeting in an attempt to resolve "the missile situation" without resorting to violence.

The Issue
East Lebatuck and San Vitenzo have accepted your request for a diplomatic summit. After a brief flight, you have arrived in Granfalloon, the dusty and impoverished capital city of San Vitenzo. Several dignitaries are already waiting to speak with you.

The Debate
*1. "Ah, the capitalist pigs have arrived!" smirks East Lebatuckese Chairman Joseph Rushev, who was handing out hammer-and-sickle pins to the local residents. "The proud workers of San Vitenzo are tired of putting up with imperialist harassment. Stationing our nuclear weapons here liberates them from the threat of outside interference. With our support and protection, San Vitenzo can divert funding from their military to schools, roads, and other infrastructure. Now kindly remove yourselves from this island before you get into any trouble — and try to improve the welfare of your own downtrodden citizens before casting any more aspersions upon our brave comrades." [Legality TBD]

*2. "Ah, the capitalist pigs have arrived!" smirks East Lebatuckese Chairman Joseph Rushev, who was handing out hammer-and-sickle pins to the local residents. "The proud workers of San Vitenzo are tired of putting up with imperialist harassment. Stationing our nuclear weapons here liberates them from the threat of outside interference. With our support and protection, San Vitenzo can divert funding from their military to schools, roads, and other infrastructure. Now kindly remove yourselves from this island before you get into any trouble — and take your navy with you." [Legality TBD]

3. "Let's not start off on the wrong foot," calls out San Vitenzo's sandal-clad President for Life, "Doc" Moreno, as he walks up to you and pulls you aside. "The hard-working people of our nation need protection from the imperialists of the world who would take advantage of us... like you, perhaps. However, these nuclear missiles have just turned us into a target. What if you and Rushev were to each remove some of your weapons that were near the other party's borders? If your missiles in Smalltopia were to disappear, I think I could talk Rushev into removing all of his missiles from this island. Now... while you're here, have you ever heard of [i]boko-maru[/i]?" He looks at your feet and removes a tape measure from his pocket.

4. As you are about to return to your hotel room, a young woman approaches you and starts speaking rapidly. "Excuse me! My name is Ramona Moreno — President Moreno is my father. Papa is too proud to admit it, but our people are starving. Since he'll never ask for it directly, I will: we need massive amounts of food and medical aid. The East Lebatuckese don't care about our people; they're just exploiting us for our resources and taking advantage of our location in case they need to launch missiles at @@NAME@@. Without your assistance, we'll quickly end up as another impoverished, powerless satellite state within East Lebatuck's Socialist Pact. Please negotiate a missile removal plan with my father — and then send us as much aid as you can afford."

The Story So Far
You are currently participating in a diplomatic summit on San Vitenzo.

The Issue
During today's negotiations, you told the enemy that it was acceptable to station nuclear weapons near your borders. Your shocked advisors have confronted you to get clarification about that particular stance.

The Debate
1. "You were just bluffing, right?" questions Defense Minister Mack Rimera, who looks like he's on the verge of a panic attack. "We can't have enemy nukes within range of our people! Our bombers are fueled and ready for takeoff as we speak. Just give the word, and this whole problem will be destroyed in a violent inferno — the only option that truly brings closure to this mess."

2. "I get it... you were only stalling so that Bont would have more time to sabotage the missile installations," surmises Intelligence Minister N with a look of dawning comprehension. "That is what you were doing, correct? We are in a position to eliminate the enemy's first strike capabilities. Let's seize the opportunity!"

3. "I thought we agreed to not meddle in other countries' business?" admonishes Minister of International Diplomacy Maureen Dusk, thrashing out an improvised version of 'Paint It Violet' on her guitar. "Send James Bont home, and let's get out of here. Who cares if they have nuclear weapons? Maybe if we started minding our own business and working to make @@NAME@@ a better place instead of spending so much on the military, they wouldn't feel so threatened by us."

The Story So Far
You agreed to remove your missiles from Smalltopia in exchange for East Lebatuck removing their missiles from San Vitenzo.

The Issue
After a series of secret negotiations, everyone has shaken hands and made a commitment to disarm. You and an aide have met with Chairman Joseph Rushev in a beautiful glass-fronted conference room in San Vitenzo to sign the final agreement.

The Debate
*1. "Good morning! Are you ready to make history? Let me just get my ceremonial signing pen." Rushev reaches into his coat pocket and removes not a pen, but a Maxarov pistol, which he points directly at your chest. "Have you noticed that world leaders like ourselves never get frisked for weapons? I can't remember the last time I had to go through a metal detector. Seems like a security flaw, don't you think? Well, I digress. I hope you didn't actually expect me to remove my own missiles. You see, I didn't get to be Chairman of East Lebatuck by giving up power every time I had a disagreement with someone. Real leaders do whatever it takes to seize power and claw our way to the top. Of course, I hope you understand that this isn't personal — it's just politics. As soon as you're dead..." Suddenly, the window shatters as James Bont crashes into the room in a hail of glass fragments, closely followed by his @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ flag parachute. Bont quickly fires a miniature grappling hook from his wristwatch, which latches onto Rushev's pistol and pulls it out of his hand. "I hope you don't mind me dropping in, boss. Your aide pressed the panic button — and I see that mister Commie in Chief is up to his old tricks. Well, here's how it's going to go, Rushev. I secretly removed a warhead from one of your nuclear missiles and handed it off to one of my colleagues in East Lebatuck. He has hidden it in your capital city, ready for detonation at a moment's notice. Either you sign that agreement and follow through with each of its terms, or your 'glorious worker's paradise' is going to be a victim of your own hubris. Are we clear?" Rushev nods and quickly scribbles his name on the agreement. "Good. Now get out of here and don't threaten @@NAME@@ ever again, or your capital will become a radioactive crater faster than you can say 'Marxist class struggle'." Bont turns toward you as Rushev and his aide scurry out of the room. "Let's go home, shall we?"

The Story So Far
You have asked James Bont to sabotage East Lebatuck's missile installation project on San Vitenzo.

The Issue
You and your advisors are gathered around the table in a secure meeting room to hear the latest updates from your secret agent, whose static-distorted voice is currently emanating from a phone in the center of the table.

The Debate
1. "Good morning. I regret to inform you that I will require some assistance," declares Bont, who doesn't betray any sense of emotion. "The nuclear missiles on this island are currently being housed in secure warehouses at East Lebatuck's military bases. The problem is that each warehouse is surrounded by a battalion of elite troops from their Red Guard. No one gets in or out without the top general's explicit approval. I need someone in HQ to hack into the enemy's personnel files and make it look like I'm a missile technician who was sent by Chairman Rushev to check on their progress. Can you make it happen?"

2. "This obviously isn't working," states Defense Minister Mack Rimera, twitching nervously as he continues to gulp coffee from an oversize mug. "The enemy is going to see right through that plan. Remember the time Bont tried to pass as a Macronesian Islander? What a debacle. The easy way to solve this problem is with a good, old-fashioned bombing. We can target the missile warehouses — at least the ones we know about — and keep civilian casualties to a minimum. Two hundred deaths is fairly low, right?"

[b][anchor=1385]#1385[/anchor]: [color=#CE532A][i]MADness:[/i][/color] Skycrash [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Story So Far
You sent bombers to attack East Lebatuck's missile sites.

The Issue
Your brave pilots made a valiant effort to take out the missile installations on San Vitenzo. Unfortunately, the enemy was prepared for this scenario. The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ bombers were harassed by enemy anti-aircraft fire from the moment they entered San Vitenzan airspace. Your military analysts are now reporting that one of the aircraft has been shot down, and the pilot was captured.

The Debate
1. "What a disaster!" shouts Defense Minister Mack Rimera, now drinking directly from his unmarked flask. "Not only were our bombers unable to complete their mission, but they're probably torturing that pilot as we speak! At least he reportedly put up a good fight before they were able to capture him. Well, screw it. We're out of options. We must launch a full invasion of San Vitenzo."

2. "Do you always let your... pistol do your thinking for you?" replies Maureen Dusk, whose guitar is uncharacteristically silent. "What if we were to offer a prisoner swap? We still have that East Lebatuckese spy we found wandering in the shopping district of @@CAPITAL@@ a while back. He didn't seem to know much about anything, so it wouldn't be a great loss. Let's offer to trade him for our pilot. If we act fast enough, they might not be able to extract any classified military secrets."

3. Before anyone else can speak, your rarely seen Minister of Mass Destruction, Dr. Helix Fenniker, climbs down a rope ladder that has just descended from the ceiling. "I couldn't help overhearing that we have a belligerent enemy and a captured pilot. Allow me to introduce 'ICE-X' — my lab's solution to both of those problems. This breakthrough bio-weapon destroys cell walls via a rapid crystallization process. Deployment is easy — we've already loaded the canisters into some modified cruise missiles. Our warships can fire them at the enemy bases with impunity! Of course, any 'innocent' civilians or animals that are exposed to the residue will experience catastrophic organ failure. But look on the bright side! Our pilot won't be able to divulge any secrets, and most of the enemy troops will be eliminated!"

The Story So Far
Your secret agent has been sent to infiltrate the enemy's missile storage sites.

The Issue
The nation's top government officials have been anxiously waiting to hear the outcome of James Bont's secret mission. As you are gathered around a table with your advisors to discuss the situation, Intelligence Minister N suddenly motions for silence and removes a buzzing phone from a nearby briefcase. "That's Bont's emergency contact number. I'm putting it on speakerphone." N places the phone in the middle of the table. "Hello, @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ swine! This is Chairman Joseph Rushev of East Lebatuck. You were expecting to hear from Mr. Bont, I presume? We caught your spy snooping around one of our military bases in San Vitenzo, claiming to have been sent by me! What kind of fools do you take us for? I think it's time that we taught you a lesson. Perhaps if I sent you Mr. Bont's severed head in a box, you would finally get the message that East Lebatuck does not tolerate espionage or foreign meddling!" You hear a click, and the line goes dead.

The Debate
1. "What the hell was that?" Defense Minister Mack Rimera takes a long swig from his flask before continuing. "Well, I hate to say 'I told you so,' but I knew from the beginning that this spy nonsense wasn't going to work. Swift and decisive military action directed at those bases is our only remaining option. We need to prepare for a full invasion — land, sea, and air!"

2. "Do you always let your... pistol do your thinking for you?" replies Maureen Dusk, whose guitar is uncharacteristically silent. "What if we were to offer a prisoner swap? We still have that East Lebatuckese spy that we captured a while back — and we already got all of the information we needed out of him. Let's offer to trade him for our agent. If we act fast enough, they might not be able to extract any classified secrets — or his head."

3. Before anyone else can speak, your rarely seen Minister of Mass Destruction, Dr. Helix Fenniker, climbs down a rope ladder that has just descended from the ceiling. "I couldn't help overhearing that we have a belligerent enemy and a captured agent. Allow me to introduce 'ICE-X' — my lab's solution to both of those problems.

The Story So Far
Your government offered to trade prisoners with East Lebatuck.

The Issue
Good news, everyone! East Lebatuck has accepted your offer for a prisoner swap — on the condition that you deliver their agent to the meeting place in person, alone and unarmed.

The Debate

1. You have arrived at the agreed-upon location, a bridge that spans the border between Smalltopia and East Lebatuck. Their spy, who is still wearing handcuffs and a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ prison uniform, dutifully shuffles alongside you as you exit your car. The night air seems colder than usual for this time of year. After a few minutes, an armored personnel carrier drives over from the other side of the bridge, with lackeys in suits running alongside the vehicle. A phalanx of bodyguards armed with automatic rifles jump out of the vehicle and point their weapons at you as East Lebatuck Chairman Joseph Rushev steps out of the back. He pulls a disheveled figure out of the vehicle and pushes him toward you as your own prisoner starts walking toward his people. "Come here, Comrade Adel. The imperialists can't hurt you anymore," smirks Rushev, who turns to face you. "So, I must ask... how stupid are you? Now I get to swap a useless prisoner for the leader of @@NAME@@! How much money do you think your government is willing to pay to get you back?" Without warning, the guard furthest to the right suddenly pivots and unleashes a barrage of bullets into the other guards, who are cut down before they realize what is happening. The rogue shooter removes his helmet, revealing the handsome face of James Bont. Your secret agent runs over to your position, keeping his rifle pointed at Chairman Rushev, and pulls out a phone. After dialing a number, he listens intently for a moment before a loud burst of static disrupts the silence. "Looks like your plans are shot, comrade!" announces Bont, mockingly. "I've just detonated all of the hidden explosives that I planted on your missiles on San Vitenzo. Consider yourself impotent! I suggest you head on home, or the next bullet that comes out of this gun is going to get a little Red." Bont turns toward you as Chairman Rushev jumps back into his vehicle and slinks away towards the other side of the bridge. "Let's go home, shall we?"

The Story So Far
You have ordered an attack on East Lebatuck's military bases in San Vitenzo.

The Issue
The enemy's soldiers have suffered overwhelming casualties, thanks to your advanced military technology. Unfortunately, East Lebatuck seems to have interpreted your actions as an unforgivable assault upon their nation and its allies. Moments ago, all of the nuclear missiles on San Vitenzo were launched and appear to be headed at targets throughout @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "HOLY VIOLET! GET TO THE BUNKER! RUN!" A flood of screaming people push you downstairs and through a long hallway, stumbling into the fallout shelter beneath your office. The door clanks shut as the last staff members sprint through the reinforced threshold. Your defense minister shambles over towards you, head in hands. "Well, we're screwed. @@CAPITAL@@ is finished. I'm not even sure this bunker can withstand a direct hit. On the bright side, our own nuclear missiles are ready for launch. Which of East Lebatuck's cities do you hate the most?" A nervous guffaw escapes from his lips.

2. "No... we can't do that to the poor folks," murmurs Maureen Dusk, devoid of guitar, her voice barely above a whisper. "East Lebatuck is filled with people like us. The oppressed, freedom-loving consumers won't ever have a chance to rise up and overthrow the communist government if we wipe them from existence. Don't retaliate, @@LEADER@@.

The Story So Far
You and your staff are huddled into an underground bunker, waiting for the end to come.

The Issue
The minutes pass in relative silence. Occasionally, the stillness is punctuated by a sniffle or a whimper that seems amplified in the confined space. A few distant rumbles can be heard, but nothing that sounds like the expected obliteration of everyone's hopes and dreams. Suddenly, Defense Minister Mack Rimera's voice cuts through the rising tide of whispered conversations: "What the hell? Chief, we've got an incoming call."

The Debate

[1]. Rimera steps away from the control panel where he was entering the coordinates for targeted enemy cities and ushers you over to a nearby phone, where a red light is blinking. He presses a few buttons to put the call on speakerphone. "@@LEADER@@? Is that you?" The static-obscured voice of James Bont is barely audible, causing Rimera to frantically increase the volume. "I was able to infiltrate the enemy's bases by posing as a technician. The whole operation here is being run by a rather boorish fellow by the name of General Stuppa. As the diplomatic conflict intensified, Stuppa was constantly arguing with Colonel Sinwat, his second in command. General Stuppa kept shouting that @@NAME@@ was a threat that needed to be taken out preemptively. Even after some sort of attack by our military, Colonel Sinwat wouldn't support any retaliation that would lead to mutually assured destruction. General Stuppa accused his officer of treason, pulled out his sidearm, and shot him in the head, then took his nuclear launch key. Stuppa and the remaining officers immediately launched all of the ballistic missiles straight at @@NAME@@. Fortunately... I had already disarmed each of the warheads." Bont's closing words are obscured by a deafening cheer from the people surrounding you.

The Issue
Although East Lebatuck remains angry with you due to recent events, they have insisted that they did not intend for things to escalate this far. As an apology for this sobering occurrence, their contrite government has arranged peace talks in an attempt to defuse the situation.

The Debate
*1. "I'd like to personally apologize for the... um... missile incident," admits Chairman Joseph Rushev of East Lebatuck, looking more sheepish than you have ever seen him. "General Stuppa was definitely not authorized to initiate a nuclear strike or take any action that would result in our mutually assured destruction. He and his officers have been relieved of duty... permanently. As a token of our goodwill, your pilot who was shot down and your agent who managed to infiltrate our military bases will be returned to @@NAME@@ unharmed. If you are willing to sign a non-aggression treaty and pay reparations for the brave warriors of communism who were needlessly killed, I think we can put this whole unpleasant situation behind us. What do you say?"

If you are willing to sign a non-aggression treaty and pay reparations for the brave warriors of communism who were needlessly killed, I think we can put this whole unpleasant situation behind us. What do you say?"

3. "Sure, go ahead and sign their treaty, but it's not enough," sighs Maureen Dusk, who is softly playing 'Sweet Home @@CAPITAL@@' on her guitar. "This incident clearly proves that weapons of mass destruction can no longer be allowed to exist. I spoke with my counterpart in East Lebatuck, and it appears that they are also willing to disarm if we do the same. It's a bold move, but I think you're the sort of brave visionary who can lead us into a new era of peace, free from the scourge of WMDs."

**4. "You've practically destroyed our island!" weeps President "Doc" Moreno of San Vitenzo, who is incongruously wearing a suit jacket and tie with shorts and sandals. How are my people supposed to 'put this situation behind us' when you've bombed their houses and crops into oblivion? Even Almighty Bokonon won't be able to undo this calamity. After you sign whatever treaty East Lebatuck is offering, you must allow our people to settle in @@NAME@@... and give us a little cash to ease our troubles. Isn't that what neighbors do for one another?"

After you sign whatever treaty East Lebatuck is offering, you must allow our people to settle in @@NAME@@... and give us a little cash to ease our troubles. Isn't that what neighbors do for one another?"

***6. "Reparations! We're not paying any stinkin' reparations!" blusters Defense Minister Mack Rimera, who has turned a rather alarming shade of red. "Have you forgotten how they almost annihilated us? Yes, we would have done the same thing to them if it weren't for that phone call from our secret agent — and we definitely killed a bunch of their soldiers. What did they think would happen when they brought nuclear missiles to our borders? This treaty is just a slap in the face — and we're definitely not disarming or letting in waves of immigrants. You need to walk away from the negotiating table, and hit them with sanctions for good measure. They're our enemy forevermore."

The Story So Far
A few months have passed since the G20,000 Summit, where you agreed to station some of your nuclear weapons in San Vitenzo to aid in their defense against the forces of capitalist imperialism.

The Issue
Today was supposed to be a calm day. The issues on your desk this morning were even more trivial than usual. Of course, that's how it always goes. Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich suddenly bursts into your office, closely followed by two other ministers who are engaged in a spirited debate. Malinovich quickly marches over to your desk and motions for the others to be silent. "Good morning, Comrade Leader. As per our agreement with San Vitenzo, we are in the process of installing a nuclear missile shield as a bulwark against the United Federation's aggressions. Unfortunately, the capitalist pigs have spotted the missiles and are now demanding that we remove them."

The Debate
1. Malinovich hands you a transcribed copy of the enemy's demands before continuing. "You know as well as I do that the United Federation's leadership are a bunch of spineless weasels who will back down when confronted with a superior fighting force like our own. Tell them to quit interfering, or face our wrath."

2. "There's no need to provoke them unnecessarily," replies Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, who is tuning the guitar that she is infamous for carrying around at all times. "What if we were to propose some sort of negotiation between our government, the United Federation, and San Vitenzo? We don't have to actually agree on anything; we just want to delay them long enough to install the missiles before the imperialists realize what's really going on!"

3. "Maybe we should offer a metaphorical carrot instead of a stick?" suggests Warwick Wampeter, one of your Co-Ministers of Totally Legal and Creative Solutions. "I've heard that the United Federation's leader, President Ken J. Finnedy, is worried about his main opponent in their upcoming elections. If we were to discover some embarrassing revelations about this other candidate, and then offer the evidence to Finnedy, I think he would be more willing to turn a blind eye. Of course, all of this quid pro quo will require a few quid — as they say in Albionia — to help us find the most useful information."

The Story So Far
The United Federation is challenging your right to place missiles on an island nation that is near their borders.

The Issue
After your other advisors have gathered their "world's best apparatchik" mugs and left the room, your Minister of Intelligence, known only as "N", approaches you to take advantage of the opportunity for a private conversation.

The Debate
1. "If you have a few spare minutes, Comrade Leader, I'd like to remind you that we have a secret agent in the United Federation. Natasha Milanova is highly skilled in the delicate arts of infiltration, espionage, and making people disappear without a trace. She's currently operating under the alias of 'Charlotte Johnson', a low-level officer at the Libertyville naval base. If you'd like, we can instruct her to focus on intercepting classified information on ship deployments and troop movements, and send us all of the details."

2. N pauses, picks up a briefcase labeled 'In Case of Emergency', and tips it towards an unused mug, dispensing an ample measure of steaming-hot tea. "Ah, that's much better than that awful People's EqualiTea they serve in the cafeteria. Anyway, we also have the option of ordering Agent Milanova to directly sabotage the enemy's naval operations. The downside of this is that she's much more likely to be caught compared to a simple intelligence-gathering operation — and we have very few agents in the United Federation, so she's much more valuable than those other incompetent zasranets that work for us. Of course, if things get out of hand and the imperialists try to invade San Vitenzo, they're going to have a much more difficult time if their ships were to suddenly become coral reef habitats at the bottom of their harbor. So, which is it going to be?"

The Story So Far
The United Federation has asked you to remove your nuclear missiles from San Vitenzo — but they'll have to use more than words to stop @@NAME@@.

The Issue
The United Federation is not backing down. The people of San Vitenzo — and your troops stationed there — have woken up to find that their island is surrounded by a naval blockade.

The Debate
1. "Well, well, well! It looks like those weasels found their courage," exclaims Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich, who is pouring something from a flask into his morning coffee. "Our supply ships with the remaining missiles and soldiers won't be able to get through without a little bit of violence — but maybe that's what we need right now. When our convoy approaches the blockade line, order the destroyers to open fire and clear a path through the enemy ships."

2. "We can't escalate the situation!" shouts Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, playing an anguished version of the '@@ANIMAL@@ Blues' on her guitar. "San Vitenzo may be our ally, but we won't benefit from getting into a shooting war over a small island with minimal resources. Have our ships perform maneuvers for a day or two to confuse the enemy, then order them to turn around. That should still be enough of a delay for our troops on the island to make some progress installing the first shipment of missiles."

The Story So Far
The vile capitalists of the United Federation attempted to blockade the ports of San Vitenzo to prevent your supply ships from getting through.

The Issue
Success! Your heroic sailors managed to sink several enemy ships that were surrounding San Vitenzo, allowing your navy to deliver the remaining missiles and supplies that were needed for their protection. As you are heading toward a meeting to discuss your next steps, you receive a phone call from N, your Minister of Intelligence, who has news from Natasha Milanova and needs to speak with you about her mission.

The Debate
1. "Good morning, boss," proclaims the steady voice of your spy chief. "Milanova reported that she was able to steal an officer's uniform and security badge that should allow her to enter the high security areas of their naval base. However, there's been a small... complication. We believe that one or more enemy agents are aware of her presence. They're probably too dangerous to ignore. Do you want to give Milanova a free hand to neutralize the threat? A few bullets should take care of... wait, did you hear that clicking sound? I hope this phone isn't bugged. Code Blue, Hermann von Pückler-Muskau." N hangs up, leaving you bewildered.

2. After staring at your phone for a few seconds, you feel your right shoe vibrating as blue text starts scrolling across the toe: "Alternatively, if you're uncomfortable with extrajudicial killings, you could order Milanova to capture any enemy spies and hand them off to us for interrogation. It's riskier than just shooting them — our enemies may have set up a trap that could result in Milanova's death — but we might be able to gain valuable intel or use prisoners as a negotiating tool."

3. While still thinking it over, you're suddenly interrupted by cooing coming from an open window. A carrier pigeon alights on your shoulder and presents a small note tied to its right leg: "There's a third way of dealing with this. If you want, you could instruct Milanova to simply ignore the enemy agents and focus on her primary mission. This might just be a diversion to waste our time. Well, let me know of your decision by this evening. PS: This message will self-destruct in ten seconds."

The vile capitalists of the United Federation attempted to blockade the ports of San Vitenzo to prevent your supply ships from getting through.

Instead of sending the imperialist navy to a watery grave, you bravely decided to de-escalate the situation by ordering your navy to turn around.

The Story So Far
You have given instructions to your secret agent and responded to the United Federation's naval blockade of your ally.

The Issue
Just when you appeared to be in control of the situation, you have received word that the capitalist running-dog lackeys attempted to bomb your missile sites in San Vitenzo. Fortunately, your troops on the ground were able to shoot down one of the bombers, and then apprehended the pilot as he attempted to flee.

The Debate
1. "The enemy pilot thought that he would be able to hide in the forests of San Vitenzo," smirks Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich. "Our scouts easily spotted the parachute and tracked him down. Comrade Leader, I think we need to send a message to the United Federation by publicly executing their pilot. No one attacks us without swift and violent retribution!"

2. "But that would be throwing away a potential gold mine of information," sputters Intelligence Minister N. "This pilot has got to know all sorts of military secrets. Let my people try to extract them. I'm sure the San Vitenzans will let us borrow that hook they use for disemboweling criminals."

3. "It pains me to say this, but the enemy pilot deserves a fair trial and humane treatment," admits Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, casually strumming a half-tempo version of '@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Rhapsody' on her guitar. "He's obviously guilty of aggressions against the Card Slave. However, we can't sink to the enemy's level. We must form a military tribunal to allow him to try to explain his actions."

The Story So Far
Secret agent Natasha Milanova is on assignment at the United Federation's Libertyville naval base.

The Issue
You and your advisors are gathered around the table in a secure meeting room to hear the latest updates from your secret agent, whose static-distorted voice is currently emanating from a phone in the center of the table.

The Debate
*1. "Good morning. I regret to inform you that I will require some assistance," declares Milanova, who doesn't betray any sense of emotion. "During my investigations, I overheard a naval officer by the name of Captain Duffle who was planning some type of 'counter-attack' on @@NAME@@. I didn't hear many of the details, but I think something big is being planned at base headquarters. The problem is that it is constantly guarded by a battalion of elite troops from the United Federation's Violet Berets. No one gets in or out without the top admiral's explicit approval. I need someone in HQ to hack into the enemy's personnel files and make it look like I'm an auditor who was sent by President Finnedy to perform a surprise inspection. Can you make it happen?" [color=purple]Option 1 of Issue 1392 was previously selected[/color]

3. "That's not going to work," asserts Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich, twitching nervously as he continues to gulp coffee from an oversize mug. "The enemy is going to see right through that plan. Remember the time Milanova tried to pass as a Sakuran counter-terrorism operative? What a debacle. If she's captured, we'll be completely cut off from our only source of information about the Federation's military deployments. I think Milanova should just keep her ear to the ground and try to uncover more of this plan without assuming any unnecessary risks."

The Story So Far
You recently captured an enemy pilot who was attempting to bomb your missile sites on San Vitenzo. Justice was swift.

The Issue
Tensions with the United Federation have never been higher. After the unpleasant incident with their downed pilot, they are now threatening to invade San Vitenzo and destroy all of your military installations.

The Debate
1. "We can't back down now, Comrade Leader," declares Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich while furiously writing notes on a structural diagram of the nation's missile silos. "Although we don't have many troops on the ground, some of the local villagers have been trained in guerilla warfare by their government. It wouldn't be difficult to airdrop weapons and supplies. Let us fight alongside our comrades in a glorious struggle against the hated imperialists!"

2. "Are we sure that San Vitenzo is a worthy ally?" questions Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, who had been plucking a few notes of 'Born in @@NAME@@' on her guitar. "I heard a rumor that they're actually considering... market-based economic reforms." She shudders uncontrollably. "It would be a mistake to ask our brave soldiers to die in battle defending a faraway nation that might not be fully committed to the anti-capitalist struggle. Tell the United Federation that we're willing to negotiate."

The Story So Far
You chose to arm the San Vitenzan peasants to help your outnumbered troops fend off an invasion.

The Issue
The United Federation's military has invaded San Vitenzo in an attempt to find and destroy all of your nuclear missiles that are stationed on the island. Due to your over-reliance on poorly trained local militias, you and your allies are losing. Badly.

The Debate
1. "We're overextended," declares Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, playing a few tentative strains of 'Comrade Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' on her guitar. "We really shouldn't have let ourselves get involved in a conflict on the other side of the world — not without sending a lot more of our own troops and equipment over there, which the United Federation would have discovered even earlier. A few hundred guards, missile technicians, and advisors wasn't going to cut it. Offer a cease-fire and say that we are willing to negotiate."

2. Before anyone else can speak, your rarely seen Minister of Mass Destruction, Dr. Helix Fenniker, climbs down a rope ladder that has just descended from the ceiling. "I couldn't help overhearing that we have a belligerent enemy to deal with, but few of our own troops on the ground. Allow me to introduce 'VioletEye' — the solution to your problems! My lab has developed and launched an orbital missile platform that can strike any target on the planet with conventional, high-yield explosives. But wait — there's more! The missiles travel at such a high speed that they're difficult to intercept without specialized equipment. The VioletEye satellite is only a prototype, but this seems like the perfect opportunity to test it, don't you think? Just be aware that if we use this weapon, it will take months to load it with new missiles."

3. "Wow, missiles that can strike our enemies from space? Let's do that!" exclaims Crazy Boris, your only spy who is expressly prohibited from carrying exploding pens due to an unpleasant incident at a fireworks factory. "But we also need a distraction so that the United Federation doesn't detect the missiles until it's too late to avoid them. Loco Lopez, an old friend of mine in Manamana, tells me that he has successfully completed his rabbit weaponization program and is willing to let us test it. Just strap a tiny parachute on each of these frightening fuzz-balls, air-drop them on the enemy, and watch the havoc ensue!"

The Story So Far
You have called for a meeting in an attempt to resolve "the missile situation" without any further escalation.

The Issue
Surprisingly, the United Federation has accepted your request for a diplomatic summit. After a long flight, you have arrived in Granfalloon, the dusty and impoverished capital city of San Vitenzo. Several dignitaries are already waiting to speak with you.

The Debate
1. "Ah, the red menace has arrived!" smirks President Ken J. Finnedy, who was handing out miniature United Federation flags to the local residents. "The proud industrialists of the Federation stand united against warmongering commies like yourselves. Frankly, we're tired of putting up with your capitalist-shaming calumny. I insist that you remove all of your nuclear missiles from this island and send them back to your own godforsaken country before you get into any worse trouble."

2. "Let's not start off on the wrong foot," calls out San Vitenzo's sandal-clad President for Life, "Doc" Moreno, as he walks up to you and pulls you aside. "The hard-working people of our nation need protection from the imperialists of the world who would take advantage of us. We certainly appreciate your generous support. However, these nuclear missiles have just turned us into a target. What if you and Finnedy were to each remove some of your weapons that were near the other party's borders? If your missiles on this island were to disappear, I think I could talk Finnedy into removing all of his nukes from Eagleton Air Base — which I'm sure is too close to @@NAME@@ for comfort. Now... while you're here, have you ever heard of boko-maru?" He looks at your feet and removes a tape measure from his pocket.

3. As you are about to return to your hotel room, a young woman approaches you and starts speaking rapidly. "Excuse me! My name is Ramona Moreno — President Moreno is my father. Papa is too proud to admit it, but our people are starving. Since he'll never ask for it directly, I will: we need massive amounts of food and medical aid. You're supposed to be our ally, but I get the feeling that you don't care about our people; you're just taking advantage of our location in case you need to launch missiles at the United Federation. Well, without your assistance, we'll soon have to ask for help from the Federation — which means they will force us to adopt 'free markets' and sell off all of our limited resources at rock-bottom prices. Please negotiate a missile removal plan with my father — and then send us as much aid as you can afford."

The Story So Far
You are currently participating in a diplomatic summit on San Vitenzo.

The Issue
During today's negotiations, you told the enemy you were willing to withdraw your nuclear weapons from San Vitenzo without expecting anything in return. Your shocked advisors have confronted you to get clarification about that particular stance.

The Debate
1. "This was all some sort of negotiating strategy, right?" questions Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich, who looks like he's on the verge of a panic attack. "We can't just give in to their demands all of a sudden! Do you know how weak that makes us look? President Moreno has generously offered to negotiate with the United Federation to remove some of their nukes that are in range of @@NATION@@. If you're determined to withdraw from this conflict, we really should take him up on his offer."

2. "I thought we agreed to quit threatening other countries with violence and destruction?" admonishes Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, thrashing out an improvised version of 'Paint It Violet' on her guitar. "Send Agent Milanova home, and let's get out of here. Who cares if we can't hit them with nuclear weapons? Maybe if we started minding our own business and working to make @@NAME@@ a better place instead of spending so much on the military, they wouldn't feel so threatened by us."

The Story So Far
You agreed to remove your missiles from San Vitenzo in exchange for the United Federation removing their missiles from Eagleton Air Base.

The Issue
After a series of secret negotiations, everyone has shaken hands and made a commitment to disarm. You and an aide have met with President Ken J. Finnedy in a beautiful glass-fronted conference room in San Vitenzo to sign the final agreement.

The Debate
1. "Good morning! Are you ready to make history? Let me just get my ceremonial signing pen." Finnedy reaches into his coat pocket and removes not a pen, but a Smyth & Weston revolver, which he points directly at your chest. "Have you noticed that world leaders like ourselves never get frisked for weapons? I can't remember the last time I had to go through a metal detector. Seems like a security flaw, don't you think? Well, I digress. I hope you didn't actually expect me to remove my own missiles. You see, I didn't get to be President of the United Federation by giving up power every time I had a disagreement with someone. Real leaders do whatever it takes to seize power and claw our way to the top. Although I firmly believe that the only good commie is a dead commie, this isn't personal — it's just politics.

Milanova leaps toward Finnedy, kicks the revolver out of his hand, and slams him into the floor. "I hope you don't mind me dropping in, Comrade Leader. Your aide pressed the panic button — and I see that mister Imperialist in Chief is up to his old tricks. Well, here's how it's going to go, Finnedy. I discovered your plans to send an armada to @@NAME@@ to bombard us. To prevent that from happening, I secretly removed a warhead from one of your nuclear missiles before it was loaded onto a submarine at Libertyville. I handed it off to one of my colleagues, who has hidden it in your capital city, ready for detonation at a moment's notice. Either you sign that agreement and follow through with each of its terms, or your 'glorious free-market paradise' is going to be a victim of your own hubris. Are we clear?" Finnedy nods and quickly scribbles his name on the agreement. "Good. Now get out of here and don't threaten @@NAME@@ ever again, or your capital will become a radioactive crater faster than you can say 'hedge fund manager'." Milanova turns toward you as Finnedy and his aide scurry out of the room. "Let's go home, boss."

Unfortunately, the United Federation seems to have interpreted your actions as an unforgivable assault upon their nation. Moments ago, one of their ballistic missile submarines approached the surface near the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ coastline... and fired its entire arsenal of nuclear missiles at targets throughout @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "HOLY VIOLET! GET TO THE BUNKER! RUN!" A flood of screaming people push you downstairs and through a long hallway, stumbling into the fallout shelter beneath your office. The door clanks shut as the last staff members sprint through the reinforced threshold. Your defense minister shambles over towards you, head in hands. "Well, we're screwed. @@CAPITAL@@ is finished. I'm not even sure this bunker can withstand a direct hit. On the bright side, our nuclear missiles on San Vitenzo are now ready for launch. Which of the United Federation's cities do you hate the most?" A nervous guffaw escapes from his lips.

2. "No... we can't do that to the poor workers," murmurs Andrea Gramyki, devoid of guitar, her voice barely above a whisper. "The United Federation is filled with people like us. The oppressed, pre-revolutionary laborers won't ever have a chance to rise up and fight the imperialists if we wipe them from existence. Don't retaliate, Leader. The violence has to stop somewhere. By the way, it was an honor serving with you." A single teardrop runs down her face.

The Story So Far
You and your staff are huddled into an underground bunker, waiting for the end to come.

The Issue
The minutes pass in relative silence. Occasionally, the stillness is punctuated by a sniffle or a whimper that seems amplified in the confined space. A few distant rumbles can be heard, but nothing that sounds like the expected obliteration of everyone's hopes and dreams. Suddenly, Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich's voice cuts through the rising tide of whispered conversations. "What the hell? Comrade Leader, we've got an incoming call."

The Debate
1. Malinovich steps away from the control panel where he was entering the coordinates for targeted enemy cities and ushers you over to a nearby phone, where a red light is blinking. He presses a few buttons to put the call on speakerphone. "Leader? Is that you?" The static-obscured voice of Natasha Milanova is barely audible, causing Malinovich to frantically increase the volume. "I followed up on those enemy plans that I told you about. The officers were plotting to send an armada to bombard @@NATION@@ with the ships' guns. Captain Duffle was assigned the advance patrol mission near our coastline. I managed to sneak aboard his submarine before it left. As the diplomatic conflict intensified, Duffle was constantly arguing with Commander Harrigut, his second in command. Captain Duffle kept shouting that @@NATION@@ was a threat that needed to be taken out preemptively. Even after some sort of 'satellite incident,' Commander Harrigut wouldn't support any retaliation that would lead to mutually assured destruction. Captain Duffle accused his officer of treason, pulled out his sidearm, and shot him in the head, then took his nuclear launch key. Duffle and the remaining officers immediately launched all of the ballistic missiles straight at @@NATION@@. Fortunately... I had already disarmed each of the warheads." Milanova's closing words are obscured by a deafening cheer from the people surrounding you.

The Story So Far
The enemy's nuclear weapons failed to detonate due to the courageous actions of your secret agent.

The Issue
Although the United Federation remains angry with you due to recent events, they have insisted that they did not intend for things to escalate this far. As an apology for this sobering occurrence, their contrite government has arranged peace talks in an attempt to defuse the situation.

The Debate
1. "I'd like to personally apologize for the... um... missile incident," admits President Ken J. Finnedy of the United Federation, looking more sheepish than you have ever seen him. "Captain Duffle was definitely not authorized to initiate a nuclear strike or take any action that would result in our mutually assured destruction. He and his officers have been relieved of duty... permanently. As a token of our goodwill, your agent who managed to infiltrate our submarine will be returned to @@NAME@@ unharmed. If you are willing to sign a non-aggression treaty and pay reparations for the brave warriors of freedom who were needlessly killed, I think we can put this whole unpleasant situation behind us. What do you say?"

2. "Sure, go ahead and sign their treaty, but it's not enough," sighs Andrea Gramyki, who is softly playing 'Sweet Home @@CAPITAL@@' on her guitar. "This incident clearly proves that weapons of mass destruction can no longer be allowed to exist. I spoke with my counterpart in the United Federation, and it appears that they are also willing to disarm if we do the same. It's a bold move, but I think you're the sort of brave visionary who can lead us into a new era of peace, free from the scourge of WMDs."

3. "You've practically destroyed our island!" weeps President "Doc" Moreno of San Vitenzo, who is incongruously wearing a suit jacket and tie with shorts and sandals. How are my people supposed to 'put this situation behind us' when you've bombed their houses and crops into oblivion? Even Almighty Bokonon won't be able to undo this calamity. After you sign whatever treaty the United Federation is offering, you must allow our people to settle in @@NAME@@... and give us a little cash to ease our troubles. Isn't that what allies do for one another?"

*4. "Reparations! We're not paying any stinkin' reparations!" blusters Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich, who has turned a rather alarming shade of red. "Have you forgotten how they almost annihilated us? Yes, we would have done the same thing to them if it weren't for that phone call from our secret agent — and we definitely killed a bunch of their solders. What did they think would happen when they invaded our ally? This treaty is just a slap in the face — and we're definitely not disarming or letting in waves of immigrants. You need to walk away from the negotiating table, and hit them with sanctions for good measure. They're our enemy forevermore."

[b][anchor=1406]#1406[/anchor]: Can't Touch This [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Prohibition has driven alcohol underground, and bootlegging is on the rise. Moonshine and gin are being illegally supplied to speakeasies and private parties across @@NAME@@, and anyone who is anyone knows that mobster Mark Scarpone is the man running the show. Scarpone has been hard to prosecute, though, as there's no direct evidence linking him to the booze black market, and no-one seems willing to testify against him.

The Debate
1. "We need to get Scarpone off the streets, and see his criminal empire broken up," demands Prohibition Enforcement Officer Hayley Etness, bursting into your office, slamming her fists on your desk, and demonstrating half a dozen other angry cop clichés. "The only charge we can definitely make stick is a parking violation... but maybe we can arrange for the sentence he receives for that infraction to reflect the crimes we all know he committed but can't prove. Put him away for ten to twenty, and we'll be striking a blow against organised crime!" [[color=red]Must have prisons?[/color]]

2. "We need to eliminate the Scarpone problem, and see his criminal empire broken up," demands Prohibition Enforcement Officer Hayley Etness, bursting into your office, slamming her fists on your desk, and demonstrating half a dozen other angry cop clichés. "Not being able to prove wrongdoing has never stopped us enforcing the law in the past. I need officers with guns and body armour to end Scarpone and those like him with extreme prejudice! That'll teach him to defy the laws of our land!" [[color=blue]Must not have prisons?[/color]]

3. "That's kind of... uh... yeah..." worries politico Cassidy George, clutching his light green felt hat to his chest. "Don't we always say 'innocent until proven guilty'? What we need is more oversight and due process here, to ensure that we don't compromise on the values of justice that make our nation great. I'll happily head an investigatory committee, and we can review the information at hand, and I'm sure that two to three years down the line we'll have put together something to justify a search warrant or two, so we can build a sounder prosecution case. Accountability, right?"

4. "Mr. Scarpone is an upstanding businessman with many links to the community," offers Scarpone's lawyer Eddie O'Rabbit, who seems to speak entirely out of the side of his mouth. "Now this personal cheque here just so happens to be equal to the exact amount of money that would have been paid in corporation taxes this week if all this bootlegging were happening, and if Mr. Scarpone were involved. Which he ain't. Say a cheque like this were to turn up every Sunday, then that'd be a good thing, capiche?"

5. "Men like Scarpone are just parasites, but the root cause here is prohibition itself," points out your Undersecretary for Trade, who has suspiciously boozy breath. "People want a drink. Is that so bad? Re-legalise alcohol, and legitimate producers can leave the Mob with no black market demand to exploit. I'll drink to that!" He raises a bottle to his lips, which is conspicuously labelled 'PLAIN APPLE JUICE'.

The Issue
It's Trickster Night, a global event made popular in the United Federation but with its roots in ancient religious practices, where children dress up as ghouls and ghosts and play pranks if not given a sweet treat. You are making your way to your front door, when a small child draped in a sheet stops you.

The Debate
1. "Twick or tweat, twick or tweat, gimme somefin good to eat," she lisps, holding up a small bucket already half filled. "If you don't, I declare, erm... it will be not fair. Wow! You're that person wiv all the power. My pawents talk about you all the time. They say, 'Can't that dum-dum do anyfin wight?' Listen, I love Twickster Night. It's my favouwite holiday. Can you give all kids a day off school, so we can make weally good costumes? Then we can show evewyone how fun it is."

2. "Shoo, you bothersome brat," mutters your Uncle @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, putting one sour lemon drop into her bucket and dragging you inside. "This pranking is what I want to talk about. Children running around, creating mayhem, demanding rewards for no work. What happened to industriousness? To children being neither seen nor heard? Clamp down on this ridiculous imported holiday. It's harassment to allow your child to demand sweets with menaces. Issue heavy fines to any parent who lets their wretched hellion out of the house on Trickster's Night."

3. "My child, I'm so glad you're here," says your mother, entering with a tray and opening the door to place six chocolate bars into the bucket of the little girl who is still crying outside. "I'm tired of putting up with Wei's nonsense. But I do worry about all those children, wandering alone. Streets can be so unsafe. I say we encourage families and schools to hold Trickster Night costume parties with buffets, toffee apples, gift bags of sweets... dancing, if there's time. Then, the little ones could safely enjoy their evening."

[4]. "Be not one with the ghouls, lest ye become a ghoul!" howls your niece, stepping forward to deposit a graphically bloody religious tract into the little girl's bucket. "This Night of Tricks is, itself, a trick. It softens our resistance to evil, encourages us to don the robes and face of the devil, and makes us forget that the mask we wear is what we are! We must ban this demonic day, and the sale of all costumes that let your citizens pretend to be devils, harlots or other evil people. @@NAME@@ must stand unified, praying together against this evil." [[color=purple]Must not have Atheism[/color]]

5. "Ah, my favourite night of the year, all screams and sweets," comments your brother, menacing the little girl with a realistic toy axe as he snatches the bucket of candy from her, and slams the door shut in her face. "Delightful japes if someone doesn't give you enough sweets, or gives you the wrong ones. Nothing makes someone feel more alive than a good scare. Except the lady who collapsed — ah well. Let's make it a mandatory national holiday for all. No more pretending to be out. Get everyone's adrenaline pumping with some larks, like neighbours jumping out with chainsaws. Everyone — especially me — would get [i]so many[/i] sweets. Talking of which, I reckon you were a little light this year, so..." Grinning, he steps back to reveal your most important papers rendered unreadable by a dozen rotten eggs.

[b][anchor=1408]#1408[/anchor]: (A Lot Of) Pennies for Your Thoughts [Fauxia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
No one in @@NAME@@ imagined that the "March Against Zoning Proposal CWA221, Part 19, Clause F" would attract the thousands of protestors it drew; it just seemed like too niche an issue to raise controversy. As it turns out, a large number of the protestors were paid participants, marching with no interest in the actual issue beyond their fee.

The Debate
1. "Paid protest makes a mockery of the democratic process, making political power dependent entirely upon wealth and connections," blusters old money oligarch and MP @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who authored the offending proposal. "There's no reason to allow this, and it should be a criminal offence to pay or be paid to protest."

2. "I don't see what's wrong with it," argues property developer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose planned housing estate is going to be obstructed by the new legislation. "In a mature capitalist democracy, people should march for whatever reason they choose. And if someone wants to pay a few hundred others to protest, then that's just them democratically expressing their strength of feeling. What's wrong with that? Shouldn't we have an intelligent and independent populace?"

3. "I understand the potential for corruption," remarks disabled mum-of-three @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, "but some people don't have the mobility or the ability to join in a protest march. Or someone might care about an issue, but be too far away to join in a protest, or want to donate to support a cause, but not be able to get time off to march. Doesn't everyone have a right to have our voices heard? I suggest that you can restrict this practice to allow each non-attender to hire one single proxy to protest in their stead. Just establish some sort of registry, and you can ensure fairness."

4. "Let's be smart about this," suggests that crazy-looking @@MAN@@ who always seems to interject at the end with an off-the-wall idea. "You should take advantage of paid protest, and use government funds to pay for marchers that express love for your chosen policies. Any protests against you will be drowned out by your supporters, and the press will report that public opinion is on your side. Of course, we have to make sure no one leaks anything, with NDAs and hidden paper trails and the like. As long as no one leaks the truth we'll be fine."

[b][anchor=1409]#1409[/anchor]: Happy Pranksgiving! [Verdant Haven; ed: Noahs Second Country][/b]

The Issue
The wildly popular @@DEMONYMINITIALS@@BC television series Prankyard Wars has long depicted a lovable team of practical jokers attempting to out-do each other with harmless mischief. However, following a recent dip in ratings, their increasingly elaborate antics led to the accidental incineration of a public park, several houses, and most of the local fire station's equipment.

The Debate
1. "It was just a prank, @@LEADER@@!" wails one of the jokers in question, @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ "@@ANIMAL@@-Butt" @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "You can't hold us liable for it! We just thought 'FOOF' sounded like a funny chemical name... you know, like 'You got FOOFed!' How were we supposed to know it makes pretty much everything it touches burst into flames? People need to lighten up and consider our intentions before grabbing their pitchforks!"

2. "Dioxygen difluoride is one of the most dangerous chemicals in existence. We cannot allow this kind of irresponsible behavior!" roars police chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@?, wildly flailing about with @@HIS@@ baton. "They cannot possibly have acquired it without knowing exactly what it does! Let me bring them up on chemical weapons charges, and we'll see who's laughing when they get convicted as the terrorists they are. We must have zero tolerance for these so-called 'pranksters.'"

3. "We all know that the people making the decisions aren't the screen talent, but the producers!" interjects four-time Golden @@ANIMAL@@ winner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the Performers' Guild. "They control the purse strings, so they are responsible for the content! You should fine them for forcing these poor performers to endanger themselves like that, and maybe toss in some criminal charges to boot. Nobody should have to risk their safety just to get a paycheck."

4. "Now, let's sit down and have a nice fireside chat together," rolls the soothing sentiment of @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the unusually charismatic head anchor for @@DEMONYNMINITIALS@@BC News. "I am certain we can negotiate a settlement that will make all parties happy. If you look the other way on any laws that may have been broken, we can ensure that everything will be rebuilt better than before, and I can toss in some positive coverage of your current legislative efforts."

The Issue
After a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ hospital quietly paid out in a recent ransomware attack, numerous other hospitals across @@NAME@@ have been targeted by criminals hoping to cash in. The unknown perpetrators behind these attacks have demanded large quantities of bytecoins to provide decryption keys, causing hospital administrators to desperately seek guidance from law enforcement.

The Debate
1. "We swore an oath to help people in their hour of need," affirms Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the chief physician of one affected hospital, while @@HIS@@ colleagues nervously nod in agreement. "Lives are on the line, and if we don't regain access to these files, there will be fatal consequences. Life-saving surgery will be delayed, medications will get mixed up, and there's no telling what kind of vital records will be lost. We don't have any choice but to pay, right?"

*2. "You can't possibly suggest giving in to terrorists!" cries out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an adjuster for @@CAPITAL@@ Hospital's insurance provider. "It's a matter of principle not to reward bad behavior. We've already seen that if you pay, it will just happen again and again! It's more important to refuse every claim than to pay out on the off chance it will save somebody. Did I say claim? I meant demand. Refuse the terrorists' demands!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "You can't possibly suggest giving in to terrorists!" cries out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a bureaucrat at the State Assets Insurance Bureau. "It's a matter of principle not to reward bad behavior.

I meant demand. Refuse the terrorists' demands!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "We may be able to crack this code," murmurs Deputy Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of your electronic crimes unit. "I'm going to need a few dozen engineers, unfettered access to the network, and all the computing power you've got! In the meantime, you should force hospitals to set up better cyber-defenses, and fine the heck out of any that allow security breaches."

5. "This would never have happened with pen and paper!" declares a bureaucrat who seems to have worked for the government longer than you've been alive. "Leave all the computers and the internet and the saggy pants and the hippity-hop to those young folks who don't know better. When lives are on the line, you can't be online. Tell vital services to stick to good, old-fashioned handwriting — then they'll be safe from those nasty folks on the web."

The Issue
With your government allowing provinces to formally secede, East @@ANIMAL@@land has declared its intention to become a sovereign state. However, the territory contains several military bases, and more importantly, a large portion of your nation's nuclear stockpile.

The Debate
1. "Well, Violet on a popsicle stick!" blurts your Minister of the Interior, as he drops his half-gnawed spaghetti-on-a-skewer in shock. "Honestly, you need to establish some ground rules around this secession scheme of yours! We need to immediately deny East @@ANIMAL@@land's request for independence, and the same goes for any other region or province that holds anything of importance to our nation's continued existence. Either they'll happily remain a part of our nation or we'll make them stay, by force if necessary!"

2. "Come now, old friend, surely you don't want to be seen doing anything as draconian as that?" coos the self-appointed Minister of Shakedowns for the hopefully-soon-to-be-independent nation of East @@ANIMAL@@land. "Once you sign that declaration of independence, we'd be more than happy to give back those radioactive poppers of yours in return for a generous farewell donation to our new treasury. Surely any cost will be worth getting your shiny, deadly toys back, no?"

3. Your Minister of Intelligence, whose body paint matches the room's wallpaper, whispers into your ear. "Don't be startled, it's me, N! There's another solution, you know. You'll sign their declaration of independence to keep up appearances, and I'll mount a covert operation to infiltrate the military bases holding our WMDs to render them non-operational. Sure, East @@ANIMAL@@land will still have the husks that they could potentially reverse engineer, but it'll buy us at least a few years to build up an even deadlier nuclear arsenal!"

The Issue
While attempting to buy an Eckie-Ecola at your local convenience store, you are shocked to discover that after a recent bout of severe inflation, the shopkeeper is no longer accepting @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in favor of the much more stable United Federation Dollars.

The Debate
1. "I can't say I'm surprised," sighs your Minister of Finance, who happens to be standing in line behind you holding an Addison Cola and a fistful of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. "We've been spending far beyond our means, so the Central Bank's had to print more cash to make up the difference. We'll need to slash government expenditure across the board to get a handle on our debt. It'll be a bitter pill in the short run, but if you hold the line and commit to spending less in the future, I promise you it'll ultimately save the patient."

2. "Wouldn't it be easier to declare the United Federation Dollar as legal tender alongside the @@CURRENCY@@?" suggests the shopkeeper while she gives a dirty look at your wad of cash. "Sure, it will be hard to give up a bit of control and pride, but everyone will have a stable currency to rely on. We could even keep all the spare @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ lying around as a novelty for tourists!"

3. "We wouldn't have this problem if the currency was pegged to something of real value," says an old man while he peruses a bag of Arthur's Original from the candy aisle. "Back in my day, you could go to any grocery shop and buy a goat for a tuppence, with enough change for a bag of turnip candy, which was all we had in those days unlike your fancy butterscotch candy, which in those days we called buttermalt because there was a scotch shortage as the goats ate all the scotch. And just like the color of scotch, the color of our currency was gold, because we were on the gold standard. You know, if you reintroduced the standard, you can bet your bottom @@CURRENCY@@ that the @@CURRENCY@@ will be worth something again."

4. "The United Federation is trying to undermine @@NAME@@ and the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ way of life!" opines hyper-patriotic news personality Ásmunda O'Hara, who is coincidentally talking about this very problem on the TV above the shopkeeper's head. "Treat United Federation Dollars and all other currencies like the pestilence they are — burn them all! And, to stop the menace of foreign currency, the government must suspend all international trade indefinitely — after all, there's no need to exchange currencies if our economy is closed."

"We'd all be dead before you can say 'underfunded military'!

2. "It's not just a matter of cost," complains your Treasury Minister, as @@HE@@ turns down the silo's thermostat to reduce the heating bill. "An upgrade of this scale would cost us more than yuns!

Thanks to a timely mastectomy performed by the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ health care system, your trusted aide Kira Ripoli has survived cancer and received a clean bill of health. In preparing to return to work, however, she has been caught flat-footed.

The Debate
1. "How can I face the world without constantly reminding people that my eyes are up here?" asks Ripoli. "In order for both my mental and physical health to be restored, I must have access to reconstructive surgery! I mean, my breasts were small and humble, and hardly mountainous, but they were mine, you know? The hospitals took me apart — they can darn well put me back together!"

2. "This case seems clear-cut to me," agrees ambitious anesthesiologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "But it's not enough to restore what illness has taken.

The thousand-year-old @@ANIMAL@@foot Glacier, located in northern @@NAME@@, served as a natural dam for the @@ANIMAL@@ Lake. Yesterday it broke open, causing the lake's contents to rush out into the valley below, destroying the downstream ecosystem and a nearby town.

The Debate
1. "This disaster is just another example of how human-accelerated climate change is destroying the natural world!" exclaims environmental activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, slowly heating up in anger. "Cars, factories, and excessive flatulence cause glaciers like the @@ANIMAL@@foot to melt prematurely!

[b][anchor=1416]#1416[/anchor]: Building on Sand [Fauxia; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
Intelligence reports confirm that the ever-ambitious nation of Wezeltonia has been constructing artificial islands in the Maxxi Sea, in order to claim jurisdiction over the adjacent waters.

The Debate
1. "Those thieves think they can shut us out!" yells trade advisor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, placing a small ball on one side of a brass balance. "Trillions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ pass through the Maxxi Sea. If we let Wezeltonia establish sovereignty there, they'll be strong enough economically to bring the rest of the world to its knees! We need to get Brancaland, Skandilund, heck, maybe even Blackacre, to sanction Wezeltonia until they cease this naked mercantilism!" @@HE@@ drops a large weight onto the other side of the scale, causing the ball to fly and hit your young intern in the head.

2. "What business of yours is it if we develop our own waters?" snaps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the ill-tempered ambassador from Wezeltonia. "We don't tell you how to manage your outlying territories, unless your outlying territories lie in our zone of control. But I'll tell you what, maybe we could contract with some of your construction firms to help us build. That could put both our nations on a more solid foundation."

3. "Wezeltonia is destroying the environment in the Maxxi Sea!" wails marine biologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was not invited to this meeting but followed your carbon footprint here. "All that sand is destroying coral reefs and killing sea creatures in their own habitat. We need to convince the World Assembly to declare that artificial islands are not recognized as territory, to reduce Wezeltonia's economic incentive to build there. If that doesn't work, send them a telegram and order them to stop murdering harmless fish, crustaceans, and vampire squids!"

4. "It seems to me that these shores do still be international waters, savvy?" says Admiral @@RANDOM_NAME@@, looking through the wrong end of a spyglass. "Let's send a ship or two out there to remind Wezeltonia that our freedom of navigation still applies. With our patrols on the watch, they won't dare venture more than a few nautical miles from their shore! Or kilometers or other such bilge."

The Issue
The Sisters of Saint Katherine's Mercy are a religious order known for their charitable works and advocacy for the poor. Although their philanthropy often relies upon unorthodox fundraising methods, it was still surprising when Sister Deloris @@RANDOM_LAST_NAMEFEMALE@@ recently announced her intention to run for a vacant parliament seat.

The Debate
1. "There must be a separation of church and state," declares your militantly atheist cousin. "She will obviously use her religious position to gain votes and attempt to interfere with our government. Even worse, she's running as an independent candidate in one of the most vulnerable districts for our party. If you wish to maintain credibility within the halls of parliament, you cannot allow anyone in a position like this to gain office!"

2. "Citizens should be able to serve both our nation and our Creator," asserts Sister Deloris, wearing a pin that reads 'greed is a sin'. "And the best way to serve the neediest people of our nation is to be in the same room where all of our tax funds are distributed, advocating on behalf of the people who don't currently have a voice in these decisions. All I want to do is make @@NAME@@ a better place. If you claim to be democratic, my religious beliefs shouldn't prevent me from running."

3. "I don't see why any job should be allowed to discriminate based on religious affiliation," argues Sister Angela Night of the Order of Divine Retribution, brandishing a loop of prayer beads set with metal spikes. "For example, I applied to join the police, but they said that my religious background wasn't suitable for police work. If anything, I'd think it makes me more motivated to deliver a righteous beatdown to the lawbreakers and sinners that still walk around our streets with impunity. It's not just a job for me — it's a daily vocation."

4. "Perhaps we need to get our nation back onto the right track by mandating that all of our elected leaders are believers," ponders your Minister of Sacramental Supremacy, in between bouts of chanting and hitting himself in the forehead with a board. "The root of all evil comes from the lack of faith in a creator, so it only makes sense that those who govern us believe in one. @@LEADER@@, you must ensure that those running for political office have at least some sort of religious beliefs."

Returning from a business trip yesterday, your cousin had to rush his two-year-old son to the hospital. Apparently, the child's mother had been too doped up to feed the child while he was gone. Your aides say incidents like this are on the rise due to high levels of drug consumption.

The Debate
1. "Hey, raising kids is a lot of work, and you can't blame people if they have a hard time keeping up," says one of your laziest aides. "We just need more social services and government-funded day care to make sure families have the support they need. Can you pass me another doughnut? I've got the munchies."

2. "Oh, please! It's not that hard!" says anxious parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, affectionately ruffling @@HIS@@ son's hair and popping a little yellow pill to calm her nerves. "Parents just need some training, and need to pick the right uppers to help them through their busy day. Promote and subsidise the production of drugs that stimulate increased activity and energy, and no kid will ever be neglected. Right? Right? Right? Right?"

3. "Dude, if you take more of those, you will get an overdose," says local drug dealer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who came to your office hoping to sell you some of @@HIS@@ best quality weed. "If @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are so bad at raising kids, then maybe we should just stop doing it. Turn the kids loose in the wild and let them take care of themselves. They'll probably do a better job than we do anyway."

4. "Is that MARIJUANA?" bellows your chief of security, who has suddenly awakened from a stupor and is now desperately trying to look alert and productive. "Since when do we allow DRUGS in government offices? Arrest that low-life! It's time to clean up the streets! Merge the @@CAPITAL@@ Police into my department and I'll have the city cleaned up in no time!"

[b][anchor=1419]#1419[/anchor]: The Madson-Hashley Scandal [Electrum; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A vigilante group has acquired and published the membership rolls of the Madson-Hashley Club, a secret group for those wanting to commit the illegal act of adultery. With a few high-profile suicides stemming from the leak, experts are concerned that prosecuting these adulterers will do more harm than good.

The Debate
1. "No-one deserves to feel this bad," argues marriage counsellor Arnie Unterobernegger, a former politician and actor renowned for his love of eating out. "Think about the people who are going to be publicly shamed, having had their relationship put on trial. The whole process is shameful, and has already driven people over the edge. You should legalise adultery, and let the relationships of consenting adults be kept between them and their marriage counsellors."

2. A lady twisting her husband by the ear comes over. "Adultery is the ultimate betrayal and should always remain illegal. However, if I can find it within myself to forgive my spouse, then what's the point of charging him with a crime? As the offended party, I should get to determine his... punishment. You've learned your lesson, haven't you, darling?" Her husband nods slightly before she lets his ear go.

3. "Your husband's taken you for a fool," snaps @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a stiff-necked staffer who has been cheated on by three different partners. "We should not be merciful to a sophisticated network intent on breaking our adultery laws. You must set up an anti-adultery task force to uncover and expose all the filthy cheaters in this nation! We must not stop until all their lives are destroyed. As for the people behind Madson-Hashley, they're more than accomplices — they're an organised crime syndicate, who should be treated as such."

4. "No-one is disputing that the adulterers broke the law, but these vigilantes have also callously destroyed the lives of many innocent partners who must live with the public shame of their spouse's infidelity," observes Ed Indy Sand, a privacy advocate. "They should have handed this information over privately to law enforcement, rather than raising a hullabaloo, airing all this dirty laundry in public. The vigilantes should be prosecuted for causing deliberate emotional and psychological harm."

[b][anchor=1420]#1420[/anchor]: Trading Climate Sours [Refuge Isle; ed: Noahs Second Country][/b]

The Issue
Your refusal to sign a landmark climate treaty has resulted in bitter trade relations with some of the countries who did sign it. A number of imported items have run out of stock nationwide, causing them to be replaced with odd substitutes, which are now also out of stock. Upon realizing that the pitcher formerly containing luxury mangosteen juice is instead a strange concoction of vinegar and pineapple extract, everyone at the table is now looking at you with distaste.

The Debate
1. "So it has come to this!" cries Naomi Berenstein, your Minister of Health and Safety, armed with several bandoliers of vitamin C supplements. "Just go back to Brancaland and say that you didn't SEE the treaty. Of course we would have signed it if only we had known! Though you may want to suggest some... minor amendments, to say the least." She hands a quantity of flaxseeds and a jar of applesauce in a 2:1 ratio to you. "For luck."

2. "First they tell us to bankrupt our country by making reforms that we can't afford, and now they're trying to make sure we'll stay poor by cutting off our trade?" roars your Minister of Commerce, Wally Guterres, writing with a series of crudely whittled charcoal sticks. "We just need to find new trade partners. If we set all the terms, we can end this acrid drought and continue to run on what has made the world's economy work for centuries. Items like coal, oil, plaster sculptures of your face — and now there's even less competition for all three!"

3. "I knew this would happen ever since the man on AM radio said it would," grumbles retired military officer Bongani Nelson, unfolding his wrist watch into cutlery before attacking a thirty-year-old survival meal kit. "Treaties are just how the globalist elite get you to turn over your sovereignty. If we need something, anything at all, we should make it ourselves! Let's start making our own products straight from Nosaman soil, even if they don't grow here, even if they don't grow at all!"

The Issue
Avery Phillips, a young dancer, recently collapsed with the complications of what was revealed to be anorexia nervosa while dancing in the small, televised role of 'Girl Waiting for Pater Maxxmas'. National attention has now been drawn to the growing prevalence of eating disorders and related hospitalizations in @@NAME@@, especially among the dance community.

The Debate
1. "Here's some food for thought," says psychologist Des Carter, handing you a copy of his new book [i]Cogeato Ergo Sum: I Eat, Therefore I Am[/i]. "Eating disorders are growing year on year, in both male and female @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@. They may be the result of low self-esteem, body dysmorphia, or can be comorbid with other psychological disorders. Due to the high morbidity, it is vital that you subsidize psychiatric in-patient treatment and prevent future eating disorders by encouraging citizens to attend government funded therapy. Now, why don't you lie down on this couch and tell me how you feel..."

2. "Wake up and smell the coffee!" cries Honey @@RANDOM_NAME@@, mother of the collapsed teenager. "The true cause of these eating disorders is all the pressure in today's hypercompetitive, ultra-connected world. Every member of the @@CAPITAL@@ Ballet [i]corps de ballet[/i] has a teeny-tiny waist and skinny legs, and it's ridiculous! My poor child felt she'd never be pretty unless she was severely underweight. Sponsor media promotions of more healthy body proportions, and ban anyone who's simply too thin from working in sport, dance, or any role where they can be seen by vulnerable youngsters!"

3. "Please, dar-link, this 'healthy figure' is so last season," scoffs cadaverous fashion magazine editor Karla Field, covering the downy hair on her emaciated arms with her plum suit's sleeves. "Only flabby mummies who stuff their faces with fatty snack-foods object to skinny women, because they feel inferior knowing their own beautiful bones were swallowed by layers of flesh. That's not our problem. Women who eschew the ravages of food should be praised, not labelled mentally ill. My magazine will even fund a contest to crown [i]Miss Mosquito[/i] — the thinnest, most dietetically controlled woman in @@NAME@@ — [i]and[/i] provide you with something to replace that monstrosity you're currently wearing. How about it?"

4. "The obvious solution to eating disorders is to ensure every @@DEMONYM@@ gets the right calories and nutrients," interjects your Minister of Health, Lettuce @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "And how? With a simple law requiring that every citizen eats healthily and to the exact amount required, enforced by monitoring eyes in kitchens, regulated mealtimes, government distributed shopping lists and recipes and 'clean plate monitors' to help everybody finish their din-dins... even if they don't want to. As the icing on the cake, this would also allow us to prevent people from becoming overweight. Of course, it'll require a lot of oversight, and control of the national food supply, but my department can handle it."

Lashed by more rain than an Albionian could cope with, the sky is the same steely grey as the oversized hulk of metal everyone is making a fuss about, and thanks to the woolen kilt your advisors insisted was "traditional", the wind is whistling right where you don't want it to. You thought it couldn't get any worse, but just as you grasp the ceremonial bottle of bubbly and utter the words, "I hereby name this ship..." you realise you have no idea what the damned thing is to be called.

The Debate
1. One glance at @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, your Minister for Creative Solutions, tells you @@HE_1@@ won't be any help today. For once bereft of ideas, @@HE_1@@'s studiously avoiding your gaze by pretending to examine a spot off on the distant horizon. What would get @@HIS_1@@ goat?

2. To @@HIS_1@@ right is the perpetually nervous Religious Affairs Minister, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_2@@, fiddling with @@HIS_2@@ prayer beads as @@HE_2@@ considers @@HIS_2@@ many religious affairs.

The Issue
Recently, a tech firm from the United Federation used a network of computers and the latest algorithms to calculate pi to an incredible number of decimal places, smashing the previous world record by several orders of magnitude.

The Debate
1. "We can break that United Federation record right here in @@NATION@@, I know it!" exclaims excitable mathematician @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, dancing around you with a manic look on @@HIS@@ face. "All we need is a great big network of super-computers, with customised software, and a year or two of dedicated runtime. I've got some ideas for exciting new formulae that will make Chudnovsky look like a chump. I mean, what could be cooler than mathematics and computer programming?"

2. "Look, the pursuit of a list of numbers is just academic frippery and posturing," moans knitwear-clad structural engineer @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "Even physicists don't bother using values of pi to more than 160 decimal places, so there's no practical purpose here. Government research and academic subsidies should be focused purely on subjects which have real-world applications and a sound case for projected economic or societal benefit. You know, like my underfunded research on drainage applications of composite 3D-printed concrete micro-structures with resin polymer interior scaffolding. It's really fascinating stuff.

The Issue
Following the abolition of zoos, an ecological report has found that a large proportion of released zoo animals have not survived in the wild because they spent most of their lives in captivity.

The Debate
1. "I totally saw this coming," asserts a pair of talking giraffe's legs, who you realise is actually the former director of the @@CAPITAL@@ Zoo wearing a giraffe costume on stilts. "It's a sad scene, isn't it? Those poor giraffes alone in the wilderness with no way of defending themselves from predators like those supercilious tigers. The public are understandably mad that these exotic animals have no chance of surviving in the wild. The answer is simple: let us recapture all of our animals to save them from themselves and we'll re-exhibit them once more."

2. "If you knew this would happen, then why didn't you prepare the animals before their release?" questions the notoriously catty Secretary of Wildlife Conservation, Beryl Caskin. "Training and rehabilitation are what we need here. We'll get our people into the wild to hone these animals' survival instincts by demonstrating to them the behaviours that they will need to survive. For example, we could teach tigers how to stalk their prey or giraffes to whack would-be predators with their necks. A film crew can even follow us around, which will raise public awareness on wildlife conservation without the need for zoos."

3. "Any human intervention is too much human intervention," says Konrad Scheer, the head of the Special Protection of Animals Movement. "Besides, the government should be focusing on highly endangered animals such as the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ horny toad. Can you believe there's only twenty of them left? We can't risk their extinction. It would be nice if we instead left endangered animal species alone in their own protected reserves, away from other animals, with a never-ending supply of food."

The Debate
1. "Women's football is losing the federation a lot of money," sighs @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Football Federation president Seth Blather as he polishes his pricey Spinex watch. "It's a catch-22. No one wants to watch women's football because it is lower quality, but we can't invest in player development without a paying audience. The whole industry will collapse without government funding. We'll use the money to develop grassroots sport, hire professional managers, and fund executive team incentives every time we meet ambitious targets such as doubling attendance in women's matches.

"Those Bigtopians are abusing our trust by bringing in all manner of illegal items, and not paying duties on the legal ones.

3. "While diplomatic bags aren't meant to contain contraband, the greater fault is ours," observes your Minister of Protocol. "To open a diplomatic bag — even accidentally — is a major breach of trust.

4. "We should use these jet streams to our advantage," whispers your Minister of Stealth Bombing as he materialises out of nowhere.

To your surprise, the Skandilundian council that picks the winners has let you know that this year they intend to award it to you. You receive the news while on a military base, welcoming home divisions of battle-hardened soldiers fresh from ongoing conflicts on the Tasmanian border.

The Debate
1. "Looks like the Peace Prize Committee has been convinced to celebrate your pacifism," laughs Brigadier General Price @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, offering you a clipboard to sign off the latest military budget increase. "That's a victory for our chaps in the diplomatic corps, pulling strings and working their magic and reframing our military activities as being for global good. You should be proud of them and the propaganda wars they fight on your behalf. Better get working on an acceptance speech, eh?"

2. "Maybe we should instead be trying to make ourselves worthy of the prize?" suggests your niece, symbolically swatting at the military officer with an olive branch. "Bring overseas troops home, honourably discharge them from service and begin a process of demilitarisation. Like I always say to my mum, there's no need to be so hostile."

3. "Ha, these feeble Skandilunders are terrified of us, and they're trying to placate us by offering us this petty tribute," laughs your Minister of Bovine Disruption of Porcelain Retail. "We should accept the prize, but suggest that rather than a cash prize, perhaps they could cede us a little territory, maybe those halite mines in the northwest. We can deploy the army along their border to emphasise the strength of your opinion."

The Issue
Every year, the nation comes together to remember those who gave the ultimate sacrifice in defence of @@NAME@@. While the majority of the population partakes in this act of remembrance, a small number of families dread this day — the relatives of those who were executed after being found guilty of desertion. Recently released documents have suggested that many were killed as a result of sham trials.

The Debate
1. "My great-uncle @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ was no coward," sobs @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME1@@ @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, as she cradles a photo of her relative. "The military records show that he retreated from combat while under attack. However, his letters to his wife explain that he was trying to get to higher ground so that he could pick off the enemy with his sniper rifle. He was accused of abandoning his post and was tried by officers who weren't anywhere near him at the time, all without a lawyer present. All I ask is for a posthumous pardon — for him and any other veterans who were illegitimately convicted — so that at the next remembrance service, I can lay a wreath with pride knowing that he served his country."

2. "That's preposterous!" proclaims General @@RANDOM_NAME2@@, as @@HE2@@ stares at @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME1@@ with suspicion. "Pardoning those deserters would be an insult to those who died honourably on the battlefield. Moreover, everyone was tried fairly by officers who were proficient in the laws of the day. To be quite honest, I feel the army has gone too soft in recent years and stricter punishments for cowardice should be introduced."

3. "Why is it only the deceased being considered for pardons?" probes @@RANDOM_NAME3@@, a specialist in criminal law, as @@HE3@@ grasps the lapels of @@HIS3@@ jacket. "One of my clients in the armed forces was sentenced to hard labor after a very dubious trial. Critical evidence was declared inadmissible, and the eyewitness statements were questionable at best. We should set up a special commission to re-evaluate all of these dodgy convictions. Furthermore, all military tribunals should be replaced with ordinary civilian trials that have proper oversight from our judiciary."

4. "Let's test these blighters to see if cowardice runs in their blood," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME4@@, your Director of Covert Operations, as @@HE4@@ discreetly clips a tiny spy camera to @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME1@@'s handbag. "We can send them out to nations with whom we have not-so-friendly relations, Blackacre for one. Put them on a dangerous espionage mission, such as stealing a sample of those bio-weapons we all know they're working on. If they succeed... Grandpappy gets his pardon. We might even find ourselves a few decent spies — they're so difficult to come by these days."

The Issue
Shared videos and whispered rumours of a strange creature lurking in the woods near @@CAPITAL@@ have been going viral on the internet.

The Debate
1. "I heard this rascally rabid cryptid has cloven hooves, like a devil. It's clearly a dangerous threat to @@NATION@@ and must be terminated!" exclaims Defence Secretary Elmo Thudd, adjusting the earflaps on his rabbit fur hunter's hat. "If we allow this beast to continue roaming our land, it will surely lead to the death of hundreds! I say we deploy a couple of army battalions to hunt down and kill it before that happens!"

2. "Whoa, whoa, let's not be so hasty now!" pleads scientific researcher Reynard Moulder, whose T-shirt declares that he wants to believe. "Look, I agree that this leather-skinned beast cannot be allowed to roam @@NATION@@, but instead of killing it, we should be looking to learn from its mysteries. I propose we use Kirlian cameras and dowsing to locate its mystic trail, then capture it for study."

*3. "No way man, that'd be a blasphemy against nature!" yells New Age mystic and religious leader Jefferson Aeroglider. "I glimpsed this glorious creature and saw it had antlered horns, like Cernunnos or Naigamesha! Trying to capture the divine would be an insult against Gaia! We should just block off the forest where it lives and create a sanctified nature reserve where profane humanity is forbidden, save for the occasional religious rite or fertility ritual." He waggles his eyebrows suggestively. [Policy TBD]

*4. "No way man, that'd be a crime against nature!" yells New Age mystic and meditation leader Jefferson Aeroglider. "I glimpsed this glorious creature and saw it had antlered horns, like a Jackalope! Trying to capture the beast would be an insult against that which we should worship instead! We should just block off the forest where it lives and create a sanctified nature reserve where profane humanity is forbidden, save for the occasional religious rite or fertility ritual." He waggles his eyebrows suggestively. [Policy TBD]

5. "Kill it, experiment on it, worship it... Come on everyone, are we really this stupid?" asks unemployed TV personality Adam Fierce. "This so-called 'new creature' is obviously a hoax to troll people, or maybe some marketing gimmick to promote an upcoming movie. I mean, the quality of the videos is terrible! One so-called witness claimed that the beast couldn't see him because he was dressed in orange. Does that sound like a real thing to you? What I propose we do is promote critical thinking, with a state-funded TV show centred around myth-busting. Why yes, I am available..."

The Issue
Sensing a lucrative business opportunity, several major corporations attempted to capitalize on the nation's eco-friendly attitude by marketing every single one of their products with dubious claims such as "environmentally safe," "divinely blessed by Mother Nature herself," and everything in between. With scores of activists grumbling about the "greenwashing," the burden falls on you to broker a green peace.

The Debate
1. "I don't see the problem here," says United Information Technology CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@, teasing you with some 100% recyclable organic @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. "It's not as though we're lying to people: all of our product packaging contains so many pro-environment exhortations that people reading the labels basically have no choice but to embrace the green craze! If that's not 'all profits go towards supporting the environment,' I don't know what is!"

2. "Not as though you're lying?" shrieks random activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, smacking what she assures you is not a 100% recyclable organic petition down on your desk. "This is making a mockery out of all our efforts! 'Green this, green that' - it has to end! If a company wants to put environmental claims in their advertising, they need to back them up with scientific facts."

3. "Allow me to, ahem... advertise a solution," cackles East Lebatuckese diplomat @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spreading some 'Splendor in Socialism' propaganda brochures on your desk. "As long as you have greedy profit-oriented capitalists, this hoodwinking is bound to happen.

The Issue
Cashew nuts are growing in popularity, and a good proportion of the domestic market is supplied by cheap imports from the Socialist Republic of Núi Và Sông. However, that nation is being criticised for its agricultural working standards, and as a major customer of its goods, @@NAME@@ is being seen as part of the problem.

The Debate
1. "Caustic shell chemicals are released by deshelling cashews, causing chronic acid burns to workers' hands, all because Núi Và Sông growers are too stingy to provide protective gloves," lectures @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing an 'Ethical Importing Matters' T-shirt that was probably manufactured in a Dàguó sweatshop. "Worse still, many of these workers are unpaid forced labour from so-called drug rehabilitation centres. Just so you can put your nuts in a bowl on the coffee table! We should demand that these plantations improve their working standards, and ban imports from them till they do so."

2. "Look, if we stopped trading with every nation that has dodgy labour laws or workers with a skin rash or two, we wouldn't be able to trade at all," complains spice-lover @@RANDOM_NAME@@, between mouthfuls of a delicious-smelling nut curry. "Maybe instead of restricting trade you could be supporting cashew growers in this country. We can maintain good agricultural workplace standards, and have government subsidisation allow our farmers to present competitive prices. You'd be nuts to say no to that."

3. "I'm nuts for nuts too!" agrees your brother, grabbing a handful of cashew drupe seeds, peanut legume pods and almond kernels. "Except for hazelnuts and candlenuts, which shouldn't count as nuts at all, in my opinion. I have to say though, this idea of using forced labour on plantations sounds like it'd be quite good for our economy. We should set something like that up."

The Issue
Thanks to generous agricultural subsidies, @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ farmers have produced a record number of potatoes this year, generating a significant surplus.

The Debate
1. "This is the seventh day in a row my old lady cooked potato soup for dinner and I can't take it anymore!" clamours @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a farmer, dejectedly leaning on a yardstick. "We have just tons and tons of potatoes and they will all rot if we cannot sell them. The government needs to buy them from us, otherwise a year's hard work will go to waste. Give them to the hungry, find some other use for them... just take them, please!"

2. "We just need to motivate people to buy and eat more potatoes," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Creative Solutions, attempting to juggle three potatoes and staggering as one bounces off @@HIS@@ forehead. "How about government-sponsored comics, cartoons and movies where the superheroes derive strength from eating potatoes! The Amazing Potato Woman! The Red Russet! Yukon Booster Gold! What do you think?"

3. "This clearly shows poor planning on the part of your farmers," grunts the People's Ambassador from the Socialist Union of East Lebatuck. "Of course you will have a surplus if everyone decides to plant potatoes! The key is to diversify! If your neighbor Farmer Joe is planting potatoes this year, maybe you should switch to celery instead. That's why you need a centrally planned economy. No surplus, no shortages — just eternal bliss and abundance!"

4. "This potato mountain is tangible proof that commie economics are inefficient," asserts right-wing economist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, presenting you with an invoice for the advice @HE@@ is about to deliver. "Subsidies distort production, and block the invisible hand of self-correcting markets. Stop agricultural subsidies. You'll end up with a leaner industry, and some temporary hardship, but in the long run you'll be supporting the system that creates the wealth of nations."

The Issue
@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ moralists are outraged, as usual. This time, they're roasting your ambassador to the United Federation, Hermione Evans, who was revealed to have eaten fried chicken at a meeting with their Secretary of State.

The Debate
1. "I'm not going to mince my words," says ethicist Manuel Maldonado, waving celery sticks in your face. "That jerk gamed the system to put the Secretary's meat in her mouth. An ambassador who approves of the slaughter of innocents in the United Federation cannot be tolerated. It's time to trim the fat and give Ambassador Evans the chop."

2. "Can we get to the heart of the tissue - er, issue?" asks Hermione Evans, while grilling Federation Freddie's Definitely Veggie Not Smuggled Real Beef Burgers. "Meat is an important component of the United Federation's culture, and it would be disrespectful to refuse their national dishes. I support the ban on meat eating in @@NAME@@, but on some rare occasions, ambassadors need to accommodate their hosts for a job well done. We should be allowed to do whatever it takes to keep foreign relationships from spoiling."

3. "Sure, that saves the ambassador's bacon," snorts Selma Sisko, porky four-time winner of the @@CAPITAL@@ Vegetarian Hot Dog Eating Contest. "But what about us? If ambassadors are going to get their hands on meat anyway, everyone else should be able to without the law crying 'fowl'.

The Debate
1. "What we need to do is make it impossible for people to go into dumpsters," suggests Health and Safety Inspector @@RANDOM_NAME@@, applying plastic table corner guards to your desk. "Make the hatchways too small to go in, and to be on the safe side, train garbage people to check the inside every time."

2.

In the aftermath of a recent close election, your government has received a litany of complaints concerning the activities of 'Bikers for @@LEADER@@', a grassroots organization whose intense mass demonstrations in front of polling locations and alleged harassment of opposition voters may have swung the election in your favor.

The Debate
1. "We're just tryin' ta' help, is all," says head biker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, placing a friendly arm around your shoulder and pinning one of your own party's buttons to your chest. "Maybe we swung the election a bit. Who knows? We're just exercisin' our right ta' express ourselves politically like any folks can do, and you should be supporting that. Otherwise, I can't guarantee ma boys an' I will keep bein' so friendly in the future."

2. "Can't we all just get along?" asks your Director of Managerial Oversight, hanging an empty suit on your coat rack. "How about we set up special cordoned-off areas some distance away from voting locations specifically for these demonstrations? It'll appease the more enthusiastic political types while alleviating any concerns about them interfering in the electoral process."

3. "Such a nasty person. So nasty," rambles TV celebrity Edward Rump, who claims that he is the nation's elected leader, despite all evidence to the contrary. "People say it's nasty, very many people, you're hearing, they're calling it everywhere. And we need to call — they give us a call, and they vote. And the vote won't be nasty, because it's fair, and we're calling it. Bigtopia's building a call center. They're competing with us — the voters call and not the nasty people and it'll be so fair.

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Post Office reported an unexpected rise in the sale of stamps, which was oddly unaccompanied by any increase in mail deliveries. Further research has revealed that increasing numbers of @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are buying stamps to use in place of cash, with the value of the stamp acting as a promissory note for its monetary value.

The Debate
1. "I'll admit, stamps aren't ideal for this purpose," concedes grocer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who recently started accepting stamps in lieu of payment for her lovely melons. "They're a little fiddly, and if they get damp they stick together. Maybe you lot in government could make some bigger stamps, like something that would fit nicely in a good ol' fashioned wallet, without any adhesive. You could watermark them to prevent forgery, and maybe produce them at a range of values, from 1 to 100 @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. That'd be quite handy for day-to-day business, you know?"

2. "The whole point of digital money was to make transactions fully traceable!" splutters your Minister of Taxpayer Surveillance, thrusting a black market banana in your face somewhat aggressively. "We need to get rid of stamps, and make transactions of that sort occur purely digitally as well: a unique scannable code on mail can work just as well as a stamp. While we're at it we'll need to ban any other physical object that has a direct cash value: casino chips, book tokens, luncheon vouchers... they've all got to go!"

3. "It's not the stamps that are the problem, it's the illegal transactions," growls your police chief, upsetting the grocer's apple cart. "We need to fund sting operations to catch any trader who accepts payment in any form other than electronic credit transfer, and destroy their stock when they fail to comply." He stamps all over the fallen produce to demonstrate. "How do you like them apples?"

4. "There's always a simpler way," suggests grumpy genius Tari Pratshet. "All you need to do is erode the public's confidence in stamps - money only works as such if people accept its value. If you run a campaign of whispers reminding people that banks and credit companies don't accept stamps, and talk about all the things they can only buy with proper electronic credit, then they will become less inclined to treat these things as money. The fad will pass."

Dustin Wiseau, the Prime Minister of Brancaland, recently gave a speech at the Nonviolent Objective Police Integrity Group Summit, where he encouraged the international community to investigate the "suspiciously high" rate of suicides and accidental deaths for detainees under @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ police custody.

The Debate
1. "Whaaat? Why do we get blamed for a couple of suicidal thugs and a few isolated accidents?" snorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a police sergeant from @@CAPITAL@@. "Just yesterday a stupid teenage shoplifter threw himself out of a fourth floor window at our headquarters. Clearly, his guilt was too much to bear. These scoundrels would rather give up the ghost than the criminal life. We need to make our detention centers suicide-proof: ensure there aren't any ropes or belts lying around, remove sharp objects, and relocate cells to the ground floor so nobody can fall down the stairs. Increase our funding, and it shall be done."

2. "Well, the psychology of many offenders is clearly quite disturbed, so no wonder they are suicidal," pontificates @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Shrink, a self-employed psychiatrist. "We could easily solve this problem if the government hired psychiatrists to provide therapy to people in detention. We could talk them out of suicide and maybe even prevent recidivism."

3. "I'm sorry, but why don't you accept your shortcomings for once and seek improvement?" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Brancalandian ambassador, while reviewing a stack of reports. "Our Prime Minister has made an acute observation. No sane person will believe that these people 'fell down five flights of stairs' or 'intentionally strangled themselves with a pair of handcuffs'. And what about this other fellow whose cause of death is listed as 'accidental ingestion of pen during interrogation'? Clearly, some of your officers tend to use incommensurate force on detainees. You should publicly apologize to the victims and put your officers in a comprehensive retraining program. We could even help you with the curriculum."

4. "What a shameless insult!" roars @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of War, crumpling up the newspaper containing Dustin Wiseau's statement. "This is obviously another Brancalandian conspiracy to meddle with our domestic affairs and make us look like barbarians on the international arena. I say it is time to make these mapleheads pay for their transgressions. Give me permission to lob a few missiles at them, and maybe they'll stop spreading baseless rumors about us!"

Yesterday, a house in @@CAPITAL@@ City caught fire while two young children were inside. Firefighters rescued the children, who were found hiding from the flames in a closet, before it was too late.

The Debate
1. "Children who are unfamiliar with fire instinctively hide from it," says Fire Chief @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@, holding up a weighty fire safety manual titled Fires: [i]They're Not Lit[/i]. "We've even seen situations where kids have hidden from uniformed firefighters. You should add fire safety to the national curriculum and provide grants for fire departments to visit schools so that we can teach kids how to escape fires."

2. "Wait, the parents left children ALONE at home?" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while ignoring his leashed-up toddlers who are sticking their slimy hands into your sweets jar. "If these kids were not left home alone, they would have never needed rescuing! Children should always be supervised by at least one adult guardian at all times who can rescue them from emergencies. It's the only way to keep them safe. Also, parents should be charged with child neglect if their children are left unaccompanied."

3. "You know, a fire can't get out of control when nothing in the house can burn," says pyrophobe @@RANDOM_NAME@@, decked out in a fire proximity suit and wearing a fire extinguisher on her back like a diving tank. "Just mandate that all, yes all, household objects be fire resistant. That way fires can't spread as quick, and children will be less likely to face life or death situations... at least, not ones related to fires. Here, I've brought a new fireproof suit for you.

An outbreak of huanglongbing, a disease that causes citrus fruit to turn green and die, nearly wiped out all of @@NAME@@'s orange crop before it was contained. Investigators have determined that the outbreak originated from contaminated fruit brought by overseas travelers.

1. "We're at code blood orange here," reports Minister of Agriculture @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from the ministry's 'citruation room'. "Our nation's delicate ecosystem is constantly under threat from foreign diseases that can seriously harm our flora and fauna.

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Botanical Society has reported a sharp decline in wild herb populations due to over-collection, resulting in a blossoming debate over foraging rules.

The Debate
1. "It's thyme to root for our herbs!" reads the sign carried by botanist Rose Marie, who is brushing some thistles off her pants. "Our plants are cruelly uprooted to be gluttonously eaten, greedily sold, or even used by hikers as improvised toilet paper! We cannot afford to let our native species become extinct, just because they look appealing to wipe with! We should impose limits on foraging for all plant species to safeguard our flora and my - I mean our - botanical research."

2. "Will my daughter need a flower picking permit?" snaps Basil Nettles, the host of the [i]Cuisine Without Culture[/i] podcast. "And what's next, a lawnmower ban? What a joke! Plenty depend on wild herbs for food security or to supplement their income, not to mention to spruce up their bland food, and extensive regulation would leave them eating dirt. Let me give you some sage advice: foragers should have the right to roam free and collect as many wild berries and herbs as they like."

3. "Over-regulation is bad for the economy, but so is extinction," reports Deputy Commerce Minister Al O'Vera. "Especially if, say, the exterminated herb has medicinal properties - @@NAME@@ would lose out on any health benefits, and the ability to profit off of it! So how about this? Let's identify economically and medicinally important plants, then preserve them in national botanical gardens and herbaria. That way, even if foragers go wild, the nation still flowers."

4. "Plants deserve to blossom freely, not be pent-up in a stuffy greenhouse," interjects Cory Andrea Parsley, the chairwoman of the local neighborhood beautification council, dropping a bag of seeds on your desk. "We should give free seeds to all hikers and encourage them to spread them around while they are walking. Soon enough we will have a rampant vegetation to offset the loss from free foraging."

The Debate
1. "Are these decrepit buildings a blight on the place? You betcha!" remarks the ever-smiling woman, who happens to be a City Councilor, wrestling your Minister of Public Relations over the baby. "It's not just here, either. My colleagues tell me that cities across @@NAME@@ are dealing with this plague, and it's getting in the way of the plans for our new megamall, dontcha know. Local governments need broad authority to step in and seize buildings that aren't being used, so that they can be auctioned or demolished. Now can I have my baby back? I've got a hotdish in the oven."

2. "You can't do that!" screeches your rarely seen Minister of Sanity, crawling out of the woodwork of a nearby house. "Imagine what would happen if we let some mayor seize property just because it isn't being used, especially if that property is owned by expats who might have dual citizenship! Do you want an international incident on our hands? The government needs to do things by the book, and not stir up any trouble.

3. "What happens in @@NAME@@ stays in @@NAME@@!" declares vagrant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, loading a bulging stack of boxes into a shopping cart. "As far as anyone's concerned, the people owning these properties have ceased to exist.

It turned out he had asked the local vendor about the ingredients, but had been unable to understand her heavily accented reply.

The Debate
1. "Everywhere I go, I see tourists struggling to understand the many different dialects in use in this country," moans @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Tourism Minister. "So, how about we help them by printing a guidebook? That way, the tourists and the locals can communicate with each other more easily. Plus, profits from the sale of the book would obviously benefit the national treasury, right?"

She claims they indicate that the sender is annoyed at the recipient and that the full stop should no longer be considered as proper usage. Once a quiet chat has been had with the 55-year-old about why he's texting your 16-year-old niece in the first place, a conversation begins about your niece's ideas.

The Debate
1. Your niece DMs you, despite the fact that she's only just across the room: [i]smh, your messages are all so Formal And Proper... were basically having a conversation rn, so you should write like youre actually speaking out loud – add some *emphasis* and cut out those full stops, i mean, have you heard anyone speak every sentence with a flat inflection? while your at it, you should fr make everyone over 30 attend texting literacy class, yall gotta learn somehow[/i]

2. "I've never heard such nonsense," proclaims Professor Phileas Ogaria, the nation's foremost authority on punctuation. "Proper pedagogical procedures necessitate principles of punctuation, and every youth should be carefully considering how to conform correctly. If children cannot accurately use a semicolon by the time they leave kindergarten, then there's no hope for them."

3. "Ancient Maxtopia had a way around this problem," states archaeologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as she chisels away at your desk. "They used hieroglyphs to communicate the written word, and didn't punctuate at all. Imagine if we adopted a similar pictorial script that portrays modern @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ life; there'd be no more arguments over whether the writing needs a semicolon or a colon, and the younger @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ will feel a lot less threatened."

The Issue
Rosalia Fallon, your Minister of Health, became a target of criticism when she responded to a political opponent's colorful insults by saying "Maybe you should consider rinsing your dirty mouth with bleach. It might even help you get rid of that bad breath." Unfortunately, some citizens took this as actual advice that this would work as a treatment for their own stinky exhalations, and have been hospitalized with painful injuries.

The Debate
1. "Look, it is not my problem that some people in this country aren't the sharpest knives in the drawer," sneers Fallon, throwing her arms up in exasperation. "Sarcasm, people! It shouldn't be so hard to understand. Even my 5-year-old niece got the joke. I guess the proles must be so adept at comprehending rhetorical devices because of our robustly funded education system, and you DON'T need to spend more on that. That was me being sarcastic again, in case you missed it. Yeesh."

2. "Nonsense, people holding public office need to have full accountability for their statements," says Agnes Mann, popping a handful of breath mints. "If the Health Minister herself comes up and says 'use bleach for bad breath', who am I to doubt her authority? I mean, can you imagine if a world leader was to suggest injecting bleach? Not that anyone but a blithering baby-brained wibbling idiot would ever suggest such a thing, but still, can you imagine the potential harm? We need to ban sarcasm and all forms of linguistic ambiguity from political discourse and censure this minister for jeopardizing our lives!"

3. "Banning sarcasm? No way! This actually gives me a great idea!" exclaims Dave Skinner, your Minister of Alternative Solutions, rubbing his hands excitedly. "If anything, we should encourage our party members to employ as much equivocation in their speeches as possible, so they have plausible deniability if a statement of theirs falls flat. Did you make an unfortunate remark about Bigtopians? Just say it was sarcasm, problem solved!"

The Issue
Just yesterday, @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME1@@ @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME1@@ — the elected representative for Upper @@ANIMAL@@ville — tragically died while giving a speech at a hospital construction site when an entire wall collapsed on top of her. Unfortunately, various laws passed in different eras have conflicting instructions in the event of a politician's death, causing trepidation amongst the local voters.

The Debate
1. "The easiest solution would be for you to personally appoint an 'interim representative', someone to act in her stead — just until the next election," posits @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a devoted supporter of your party. "It wouldn't be long — our elections are pretty regular, right? — and it would save the hassle and cost of holding a special election. As it happens, I know just the right candidate..."

2. "It seems to me that the person who was elected should have the right to pick their successor, if they are unable to finish their term," declares @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME1@@, the son of the deceased representative. "Presumably, they would choose someone who was of like mind, and could be counted on to continue supporting their predecessor's agenda. If the new person turns out to be a dud, they would surely be voted out at the next election. Just require all elected officials to write down their preferred replacement on some sort of notarized form, and the problem would be solved."

3. "HELP, HELP, I'M BEING REPRESSED!" melodramatically screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an independent candidate famously opposed to the formation of political parties. "Strange coroners sitting in offices distributing death certificates is no basis for a system of government! Just have a by-election, the same as any other proper democratic country. No one knows who's the next candidate the people might want, so we'll have to put it to the people to find out!"

4. "Actually, I know exactly who the people want," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the most recent opposition candidate for the seat. "Me! I had the next most votes, and in the event of an elected official's untimely passing, the runner-up should be given the job. Surely, that's the best way to respect the will of the people — or at least 37% of them."

5. "Pffft. So she's dead. That doesn't affect me!" derides @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who lives in a nearby district. "You always forget about us Lower @@ANIMAL@@ville folks. Those toffs from Upper @@ANIMAL@@ville get all the funding, and we get squat! They can do without an elected representative for a little while. That'll teach them."

The Issue
When mother-of-twins Annie @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ was held up at gunpoint by a mugger, she immediately surrendered all her cash and jewellery, rather than risk the lives of her ten-year-old boys. Shockingly, not only had she not attempted to use lethal force to defend her family, but she had also left her one and only shotgun on the kitchen table at home.

The Debate
1. "Owning a gun is compulsory for a good reason," points out your Minister for Personal Defence, adjusting her H&K MP5K holster to stop it from catching on her backslung C14 Timberwolf sniper rifle. "But what's the point in compulsory ownership if you don't carry your weapon? As far as I'm concerned, failing to carry a proper deterrent makes Ms Clarke culpable for inciting violence. Citizens have a duty to pack heat whenever they leave the home. An armed populace is a safe populace!"

2. "I'm sorry, I just had so much stuff to carry with the kids' spare clothes and snacks and school bags and all the rest," weeps the deeply ashamed young mom. "I know I shoulda been packin' heat, I know it, but it's just so hard to do so every hour of the day! Have some mercy, guvmint man, and maybe put more gun-totin' police on the streets to keep us safe when our hands are full."

3. "Where was the man of the family in all this, eh?" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, before pausing as someone whispers in his ear informing him that the lady is a recent widow from gun-related street crime. "Oh... uh... right. But what about these two twins? They're both the men of the family now, and morally responsible for protecting the weaker sex!"

4. "Hrmm... Did we...?" wonders Minister of Bookkeeping @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as he leafs through the statute books. "Oops, yes we did. Looks like we accidentally used the word 'must' instead of 'may' here when we made that last change to the law about firearm ownership.

The Issue
After many years of faithful service, your current vehicle broke down on the highway this morning, forcing you to squeeze into the back of a police car like a common hoodlum in order to get to work. To avoid any further embarrassments, your advisors have asked you to pick a new state car to whisk you to-and-fro when required.

The Debate
1. "Look, that old barge was pretty, but it might not have been adequate if there was a bomb attack!" proclaims General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, gesturing wildly and getting uncomfortably close to your face. "What we need to protect you is a state-of-the-art military vehicle. I'm talking 10cm thick carbon-ceramic armour, missile launchers, gun nests, and plenty of room for a squad of special forces operatives. Let's make something no enemy of the state would dare even look funny at, let alone consider attacking!"

2. Suddenly, your windows are shaken by what sounds like the bellow of a wild animal as eccentric TV star and car enthusiast Clark Jeremysson revs the engine of his Berrari Forza-Azzurri, then proceeds to address you using a megaphone. "Your people judge you based on what you're driving. How on earth can they connect with you on a personal level if you're riding around in a hybrid battlecruiser-tank thing? You should get something fast and exciting — a proper supercar — and drive it yourself. Show everyone that you're a real take-charge leader who goes wherever you want, at whatever speed you want. People will love it!"

3. "Heaven forbid that such an uncouth brute should influence Your Excellency," sputters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of sales at Bolls-Boyce, bowing low and taking off @@HIS@@ hat. "My dear, the vehicle that served you was very fine indeed, but fear not, for we can make a more luxurious replacement at our coachbuilding studio that will be far superior to the pedestrian wares offered by Maxcedes and Barryan Motor Works. If you would be so kind as to tell me your preferred leather suppleness and decanter temperature, my master craftsmen can get to work post-haste."

4. "Why waste taxpayer money on an expensive limousine when you can set an example of frugality?" questions your Minister of Anti-Corruption, who also happens to be your niece. "Just drive whatever's available, like one of the compact cars in the government's vehicle pool. They're all made by General Chassis, right here in @@NAME@@. It'll help reduce government spending, while demonstrating your support for the local automotive industry."

5. You think you're finished, but then a scraggly hippy who had appeared to be a large bush stands up and starts moving in your direction. "Like, dude... it's you, man! I always thought you were cool! Hey, listen, I want to rap with you about something. Like, cars are so last century, dude! The people will totally be down with it if you just... like, walk everywhere.

Today, among your mail, a black envelope with a pentagram on it caught your eye. You opened the envelope, and the letter inside said: "Blessed Chosen One, I am happy to inform you that you have just been granted the [b]Opportunity to Change Your Life[/b]. [i]The magnificent energy of the cosmos[/i] is waiting to surround you. If you copy this letter and send it to 100 other people, you will be granted ONE HUNDRED blessings for ONE HUNDRED days. But! If you spurn these gifts — YOU will be CURSED FOREVER. Choose wisely!"

The Debate
1. "This is a disaster!" whimpers your secretary @@RANDOM_NAME@@, looping @@HIS@@ four-leaf clover pendant around your neck and knocking on your wooden desk repeatedly. "I had a friend in elementary school who failed to pass on a chain letter she received, and she came down with terrible chickenpox afterwards. This is no joking matter, @@LEADER@@. You should immediately start making copies and sending them out if you want to protect yourself from harm."

2. "I'd bet my bottom @@CURRENCY@@ that this is just another teenage prankster," muses police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, inspecting the envelope with a magnifying glass to check for fingerprints. "But we ought not let this scoundrel waste your precious time with this nonsense. Grant my department permission to track down and punish the senders of anonymous letters composed with the criminal intent to frighten or defraud." He tosses the letter to one side, accidentally knocking a small mirror off your desk.

3. "If anything, this shows you're not taking your personal security seriously enough, @@LEADER@@!" yells bodyguard @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former army officer, who has perused the letter and is now patrolling the vicinity.

The Issue
@@NATION@@ ground to a halt after a nationwide blackout resulted in dark street lamps, traffic jams and melted ice creams. It was caused by the country having insufficient fuel to generate electricity, with the bulk of the fuel being exported due to long-term supply contracts.

The Debate

1. "I've come to talk with you again," pesters @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ Simon, your Minister of Energy, @@HIS@@ figure barely visible in the naked candlelight. "The nation has enough fossil fuel reserves to power itself. However, corporations like Conch and Epsilon Mobil are profiting from their export rather than ensuring our country has enough electricity! Nationalise them and tear up the contracts so that our power plants always have enough fuel. The companies have been given too much free rein on our resources and we don't need their technical expertise anymore."

2. "Nationalisation is like a cancer that grows," says Conch Chief Extraction Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ Garfunkel. "By nationalising, you're creating an inefficient government-run company that will be vulnerable to corruption. You're also going to be losing a long-term source of tax revenue by walking away from our contracts. Instead, you should approve drilling in that natural gas field we've always wanted to develop near @@CAPITAL@@. That way, there'll be more than enough fuel to meet our export obligations and your electricity generators' needs."

3. "If we can no longer rely on power plants to provide electricity, why don't you let us generate it ourselves?" asks an off-the-grid citizen completing his fortnightly run for loo rolls and gum. "See, I have this big diesel generator at home which is powering the local area during the blackout. There were some noise and pollution complaints at first, but the neighbours aren't objecting now. It would be an easy change too, just dismantle the energy networks and pay us little guys to distribute energy locally."

The Issue
Electric cars have vastly reduced air pollution in @@NAME@@. However, this has accompanied a surge in demand for lithium, a scarce element primarily obtained through heavy mining. As lithium salts are a critical component in electric vehicle batteries, your advisers fear a shortage could cripple electric car manufacturers and the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ lifestyle.

The Debate
1. "Without additional lithium, there could be a lot more horse-drawn carts on the roads, or even worse, gas guzzlers!" exclaims resource analyst @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "But don't worry, @@NAME@@ has plenty of untapped lithium deposits! The biggest ones just, uh, happen to be located in pristine nature reserves. Anyway, not using our own natural resources would make us dumber than a box of rocks. Give the mining industry the go-ahead to expand lithium extraction operations; it'll keep our cars cheap and skies beautiful."

2. "Doesn't mining defeat the purpose of electric cars?" asks trade official @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while eating from a lunchbox that is clearly labeled 'Property of the Maxtopian Embassy'. "Rather than destroy our own environment, let somebody else destroy theirs. Dump lithium extraction in @@NAME@@, and instead rely on cheap imports from dirt-poor countries like Kawandaland. There'd hardly be any downsides. Well, I mean, the mining sector obviously wouldn't like it, we might shed a job or two, and there could be supply disruptions whenever Kawandaland goes through a coup, but electric car manufacturers will be jumping for joy!"

3. "Lithium-ion batteries power tons of often-tossed electronics," yaps @@CAPITAL@@-area sanitation director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is wearing a T-shirt with the slogan 'Garbage In, Treasure Out'. "We can reuse that lithium if we expand recycling infrastructure to accommodate the extra rubbish. Now look, this garbage idea has a catch — lithium recycling can't beat mining in terms of output — so there'd be less of the stuff to go around. However, if we reduced lithium demand by hiking taxes on automobiles and electronics while also encouraging use of mass transit, we'd be able to make it work."

As a symbol of historic cultural ties, the nation of Brancaland has gifted @@NAME@@ a dozen Brancalandian Spiked Aspen trees. These were ceremonially planted in the famed Jellostain National Park. Unfortunately, it's now been discovered that the trees are host to a parasitic fungi endemic to Brancaland, which is now spreading and ravaging the local woodland.

The Debate
1. "Let's not panic!" says one of your diplomats, panicking. "Brancaland had good intentions, but we need to contain the spread before the entire nation is infected. Luckily the fungal infestation is only in this part of the park, so let's enclose the section with the trees with a glass bio-dome, and allow access only to a select few. We can import more Brancalandian flora and dedicate the arboretum to our nations' enduring friendship."

2. "You don't know what this fungus can do," flatly states Forestry Commission Warrant Officer Elaine Wipley, with the look of a shell-shocked veteran. "If one of those spores gets out there, that's it! Taking off and nuking the site from orbit is the only way to be sure. No? Well, at the very least, you need to send the army in with flamethrowers, to burn everything in a three-mile radius."

3. "It's too late for the park," whispers General Cody 'Iron Eyes' de Corti, shedding a single tear as he surveys the devastation. "They destroyed our park; we can destroy theirs too. You should allow us to covertly release the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Destroying Angel Fungi over the Brancalandian pine forests. Let the invaders feel our pain."

The Issue
Zeerocks, a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ company known for manufacturing photocopiers, has recently come into conflict with a corporation in the mostly harmless nation of Merovingia that makes a similar product. The Merovingian company has been using the common phrase 'zeerocksing' in their advertising and packaging, even though Zeerocks owns the trademark for the term. The inevitable legal dispute has now come to national attention.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, it is essential that this term remains exclusive to the products and services of our company," claims a sharply dressed representative from Zeerocks, handing out zeerocksed packets of heavily laminated legal documentation to everyone in close proximity. "When direct competitors use the term to describe the services that we exclusively offer, consumers begin to associate the term with photocopying, which zeerocksing simply is not. Furthermore, we have legally registered this trademark and should have full rights to control its use."

2. A sophisticated-looking executive from Merovingian Minolta directs your attention to her slideshow presentation. "As we can see here, photocopying involves the same exact process as zeerocksing. It is preposterous to use multiple terms for the same exact action, and makes no sense for a company to be able to own a commonly used word. Therefore, since the Zeerocks trademark is already a generic term, anyone should be able to use it."

3. "We might as well rip off the band-aid now," claims your Minister of Abrupt Solutions, while using a sharpie to write notes on some post-its. "This case is a dumpster fire of complex trademark laws, and I bet we'll see a plethora of new cases no matter who wins this lawsuit. It's as clear as plexiglass that we need to abolish all existing trademark laws, so that this doesn't hoover up all of our legal system's resources. Now does anyone have an aspirin? My head feels like someone hit it with a thermos."

4. "That is just going to cause even more confusion," drones Xanatos Vajiralongkorn, whose gray suit matches his gray demeanor. "Why do we need branding in the first place? All of this marketing is just another way for the big, rich corporations to control the public. You should require all products to be sold in monocolored packaging with no graphics or brand names on them."

That's none of my business, and the government shouldn't be asking about it either.

Specifically, rumours have recently surfaced that children from families of the faith are being forcibly separated from their parents, and made to attend state re-education centres for indoctrination and conversion.

The Debate
1. "The sons and daughters of @@RELIGION@@ are being ripped from the bosom of loving families," complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the @@DEMONYM@@ branch of Human Rights Watch International. "We should call for international condemnation, and enact tough trade sanctions against Dàguó. Additionally, we should offer these persecuted souls refuge, and provide help for them to travel here. We should always prioritise asylum for the children of @@RELIGION@@."

2. "@@RELIGION@@ is losing numbers, and we have to rectify that," observes your Minister of Memetic Utilitarianism. "The moral arithmetic is simple: we should locate and forcibly centralise Dàguó immigrant children within @@NAME@@, establishing a Faith Academy where they can learn to renounce their fatherland, and devote themselves to our Holy Truth."

3. "These rumours are categorically false," recites a thirteen-year-old @@BOY@@ in a plain grey concrete room, on a video recording sent to you.

The Debate
1. "Giving married couples extra benefits is just unfair, man," complains concerned citizen Chuck Sandler, accompanied by his longtime roommate Larry James. "With this wonky tax code, everyone just marries before tax season and immediately divorces after. There are probably statistics and stuff saying that. Besides, this is discrimination against singles. Why not allow lovers and best friends to fill out tax returns together just like married couples do?"

2. "Hogwash! You won't listen to this deranged @@MAN@@, will you?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of Burpbarry, looking flabbergasted. "Don't forget that we are a luxury brand, and exclusivity is maintained by controlling the supply side of the equation. What distinction would wearing a Burpbarry outfit confer on you, if any old scrounger could get the same things from a donation bin? Market freedom means being allowed to protect our brand value, and to dispose of our own property as we see fit."

3. "Frankly, your disposal method is disgusting!" fumes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an environmentalist and DIY enthusiast, sporting a hat made of a recycled yogurt tub. "If companies want to get rid of their surplus without diluting their brand, why not upcycle inventively? For a start, I think those fancy Burpbarry scarves could be braided into a reusable canvas bag. Perchance you should seize the end-of-season surplus, and employ skilled weavers to turn them into something new."

"You can see it all on the body cam footage, so it's not like anyone can say I'm lyin'.

The Issue
A small island has vanished into the sea, farmland was flooded when a river burst its banks, and whole villages have been near-submerged by rising waters. The reason for these floods? Sand mining: billions of tonnes of sand and gravel extracted from rivers, lakes and coastlines.

The Debate
1. "We can't stop the modernisation of @@NAME@@," states Matthew Mountsermon, your Minister of Residential Construction on Aggregates. "These materials are the literal foundation of our economy! If you want buildings and infrastructure, you need sand! Glass, computer chips... sand! Did you know it takes 30,000 tonnes of sand to build just one kilometre of a motorway? Avoiding flooding just takes a little planning, and maybe some concrete barriers. Nothing should hinder the development of @@NAME@@!"

2. "Our addiction to sand is staggering," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Environment Minister, as @@HE@@ tries to prove how easy it is to reuse everyday objects by cleaning @@HIS@@ fingernails with a paper clip. "At first they extracted it from quarries, but when those ran out, they took sand from beaches, then islands, now they're dredging the seabed.

"True, desert sand is too fine and we haven't found a way to bond it together yet, but I'm sure if we give it a go, and give it lots of determination and government funding...

The Issue
Duke Geoffrey Bannister, a 13-year-old scion visiting from the ancient nation of Maxtopia, is an absolute oik who seems to lack impulse control and empathy, and is known to have terrorized his own fiefdom with no regard for human life. Many blame his odious personality (and his distinctive jutting "Maxburg chin") on generations of interbreeding. A council of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ nobles has been convened to discuss how this sort of outcome can be avoided amongst your own nation's nobility.

The Debate
1. "The things we do for love," complains @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ noble James Bannister, who is an indeterminate relative of the young duke, and has just returned from an arduous and prolonged trek to drop the young horror back home. "My uh... 'nephew' is a special case. But you can't always blame genes! I mean, his mother is a fine figure of a woman. A fine, fine figure. There have always been occasional bad eggs, but breeding true has benefits too. We have to think about our dynastic security and continuation of stable government! If anything, we ought to be quashing this seditious talk about inbreeding and bad genes, and instead require that noble blood is never diluted with the common classes. We are their social betters!"

[2]. "I love my dearest @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@; we'd play together at Uncle's estate when we were growing up, and that gives us a bond beyond our blood," chuffs Lord @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, his dangling jeweled chains hypnotically bouncing off of his pendulous gut. "But maybe we could keep the gene pool diverse and playtime interesting by adding two — or ten — consorts from the middle classes into the mix, and legitimising the bastard offspring by default.

3. "Widening the gene pool is sensible, but we can maintain some decorum while doing so, and perhaps also accrue some political advantage," muses noble matriarch Helena Tyrone, smiling slyly at you. "I wonder if perhaps a small group of powerbrokers, led by yourself, could arrange matches between our nation's nobles and suitable men and women of power from across the world. Young folk should offer love to and breed with who we tell them to, don't you think, my dear?"

4. "Know what the problem is?" asks General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, immediately answering @@HIS/HER@@ own question before you can reply. "These loons being empowered at all.

A mall in @@CAPITAL@@ recently introduced women's parking spaces that feature extra width and better safety through improved lighting. Celebrity podcaster and influencer @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ recently had his car towed for using one of these spaces, and is bringing the spots into the spotlight.

The Debate
1. "These gendered parking spaces are discriminatory and they must be banned," says @@RANDOMFEMALELASTNAME@@ in @@HIS@@ podcast, always seemingly a few words away from being dropped by @@HIS@@ sponsors. "There were no places left! What was I meant to do? It's not like parking lots are dangerous places. Man, this incident really makes you think about sexism. Anyways, this week's show is brought to you by the Jock Club, where for a few rubles a month, you will receive a curated selection of underwear..."

2. "This mall's initiative is simply giving a traditionally masculine space a woman's touch," interjects Minister of Safety Birgitta Serling, while she turns off the podcast and starts capping all of your pointiest pens. "In fact, we should roll out a nationwide quota of non-masculine parking spaces. It will make it so much easier to park and will do wonders for assault rates! By bringing them down, I mean..."

3. "If you ask me, these solutions won't fix the greater cultural problem — the lack of safety," offers a passing therapist, showing you an inkblot that looks like a parking space. "If you fund more night-time patrols and pay for security cameras in all parking lots, fewer people will be anxious. And, if people are worried about being watched constantly, I'm sure they can get professional help. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to go; your two minute consultation is up. Any more and I'd have to charge you."

[4]. "SILENCE!" booms His Wisdom N. Sanni Teeh, Grand Kahuna of the Cult of Cyan, who has been pushing the little-known religious organisation to rename itself 'Cyantology'.

A series of accidental shootings and catastrophic malfunctions has triggered debate surrounding the safety and reliability of civilian firearms.

The Debate
1. "I bought a pistol, not a grenade!" shouts former military officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, her arm suspended in a sling. "I was mugged yesterday, but when I tried to defend myself, my handgun exploded and almost killed me! This cannot continue! All firearm companies must prioritize weapon safety and rigorously test their products to prove they are reliable."

2. "This reveals an underlying problem: our firearms need an update," explains corporate futurist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, polishing her toy ray-gun. "Malanasia ought to innovate and overhaul civilian weapons with emerging tech like biometrics, recoil-dampening composites, and interwoven electronics. The resulting smart guns would limit accidents while also improving safety. Just shoot a grant or two at gun-makers to cover the cost of R&D."

3. "Safer guns are pointless if the average shooter can't clean a barrel," asserts firearms instructor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Malanese guns are notoriously unreliable, but their frequent malfunctions can be minimized with proper upkeep. All gun owners should be required to complete a training course in weapons maintenance. Maybe then I won't get dirty looks when asking clients if they're stripping."

4. "Y'all betta not be tryna mess with my guns," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wielding a rusted, homemade shotgun. "Malanese guns work just fine, and we don't need no safety courses or fancy microchips! All those accidents is just weedin' out the butt-brains!" She fires her weapon into the air, and the barrel shatters.

*1.

[3]. Reverend Indy Nile is both a priest and a general in the Sacerdian Holy Army, and he has a counter-proposal. "Gayness is against the will of the Lord our God. We will give you back these transgressors, but you must recognise the holy truth that homosexuality is a grave sin.

He gazes up adoringly at a semi-naked statuary depiction of his deity. [[color=purple]Must not ban religion[/color]]

4. "We have to be balanced about this, I'm afraid," offers Foreign Office diplomat Hyde Yorlove. "Out of respect for judicial sovereignty we must leave the couple to the mercy of the Sacerdian justice system. To stop this happening again, maybe we can set up a bureau to issue guidance and travel advice for gay holiday-makers."

5. "RAAAAAAAAAARGH!" bellows perpetually angry gay activist Neil Foreman, tipping your desk over in a rage. "I am Gay Man! Hear me roar! My leader, we cannot negotiate with filthy homophobes and bigoted scum! Send the army in, and rescue my proud brethren, then bomb Sacerdia till they agree to repeal their homophobic laws.

The Issue
The nation's strict animal welfare regulations for slaughter are up for debate, as the Order of Violet lobbies for an exemption to allow ritualistic slaughter.

The Debate
1. "According to the Book of Violet, the Prophet Max, Chapter VII, 'Ye shall taketh thine animal and, reciting the Oath to Violet's Dread Divinity, ye shall inserteth a red-hot poker up yonder...' well, you can guess the rest," chuckles eccentric subdeacon @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Currently, our followers have to import their meat — at great expense — from more tolerant countries, or they're stuck eating vegetables. Do you know what Violet has to say about the preparation of asparagus?" He winces for dramatic effect. "Grant us an exemption to these discriminatory laws, and allow us to slaughter animals as the almighty Violet demanded."

2. "It's obvious how that one will end up," growls @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ of the Hackett & Beatty Abattoir, gazing longingly at a room full of blunt instruments, chainsaws, and a particularly large stick with a rusty nail in it. "Restaurant buyers will just ask for Violetist-certified meat anyway, as they can serve that to anyone. Meanwhile, your average Joe Kill-Cow is stuck stunning and whatnot, and struggling to make a living. Rather than one-off exemptions for Violetists, trust butchers. Then we can remain competitive by finding cost-effective ways to operate and everyone will be happy. Well, except the animal-friendly lot, but they're too protein-deficient to make much of a fuss." She points a stun gun at a cow. "Daisy, I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse."

3. Miles Stewart, proponent of the 'Killing Through Kindness' method adopted by precisely zero abattoirs since last year's book tour, coughs quietly. "One life is worth as much as any other, and animals deserve to go in the same way we'd want to: in our own beds, surrounded by our loving family, with peaceful sitar music playing and incense sticks burning."

The Debate
1.

2. "What if we made shows put epilepsy warnings before each instance and program?" suggests children's show editor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, showing you a happy face with a warning in colorful, flashy letters. "Then people will know when to switch channels, and networks will favor writers who are more conscientious. It's a nice compromise that can be applied to all media. Hey, I know a song about compromise we can all sing! Just to warn you, there's some moderately loud clapping in the middle."

3. "Why should my show be compromised?" refutes popular TV show host @@RANDOM_NAME@@, entering your office with blinding rainbow strobe lights. "Which would you rather watch?

With heartfelt and sometimes sincere congratulations pouring in from leaders all across the world, eyes are turning on @@NAME@@, eager to gauge your reaction.

The Debate
1. The Minister of Foreign Relations lays her hand on your right shoulder, the sunlight creating a bright halo around her head. "Oh, let bygones be bygones already. This is a joyous occasion for Madam Drake! Let's break the ice between Blackacre and us, and send over our most cordial felicitations.

2. The Minister of Defense lays her hand on your left shoulder, tufts of her hair sticking up like horns. "Don't listen to that naive dimwit! We need to show the world that that vile succubus and her larva don't deserve any 'best wishes' to be sent their way. How about we discreetly spread some nasty rumours about how the father of the child is a descendant of Lee Terallihitlah, the Butcher of Bigtopia? You'll see, all sympathy for that serpent and her spawn will melt away like snow."

3. "Oh we can do far better than a few rumours," whispers Miriam Asda, a refugee whose family died in one of Blackacre's many wars of aggression. She beckons to you from the shadows, to suggest a third, even darker path. "I suggest we send our best wishes, and maybe some baby gifts, laced with subtle biotoxins that will induce miscarriage. Trust me, she deserves nothing less."

4. A civil servant walks in on the meeting, and ruins the ambience by turning on the fluorescent ceiling lights. "Oh, uhm, s-sorry... but I came in to tell you that you could also simply ignore the entire affair. Pretend that you didn't hear about the pregnancy because you were too busy volunteering in orphanages to follow international gossip. It'll create a positive image of yourself, and you'll have a great excuse to change the subject to how awesome you are."

"At first she was delighted to see that they had a pen of guinea pigs, which she thought was a petting zoo, until one of the waiters explained that those animals — which his people call [i]cuy[/i] — were actually there so that diners could choose which ones they wanted to eat. She was still crying right up until she finally went to sleep that night. It shouldn't be allowed! Some kinds of animals are food but some kinds are just pets instead, at least in civilized countries like ours, and the law should make it clear which are which."

2. "But the guinea pig has always been an important meat animal for the Tiquitacans, and it's really tasty too. I remember that from when I was posted at our embassy there," remarks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Foreign Minister, salivating slightly. "Not only should we continue to allow the use of guinea pigs as meat, but there are so many other foreign delicacies that we should encourage restaurants and shops here to stock as well: Skandilund's reindeer hind cutlets with eyeball sauce, for example, or Tasmanian fermented platypus eggs. Yum!"

3. "All meat is murder!" protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Environment Minister. "It's a slippery slope: First, people eat the flesh of 'domestic livestock', then they eat the flesh of animals traditionally kept just as pets... and then, maybe, they'll even 'graduate' to putting pineapple on pizza! It's barbaric! This incident is just more proof that we should outlaw meat-eating altogether."

The Issue
Your re-election campaign has been thrust into the headlines due to adult film star Catherine Gratwick announcing her full-throated support. She has since hooked up with your campaign manager to offer her services on the campaign trail.

The Debate
1. "That's a great ass... uh, asset!" assesses your brother, fingering through an assortment of Gratwick's films. "You should flaunt the association all over the place and assert your dominance over the competition! Ask for her assistance at every assembly. The moralists may assail you for it, but rest assured, you don't need their assent to get over the hump. Tell them to shove off and assimilate into the modern world."

2. "Screw her!" shouts your self-appointed morals counselor, Prue Dish, confiscating your brother's movies while he is busy cheering. "Gratwick is a disgusting, disgraceful deviant! Those are the triple Ds of her profession. You can't possibly get into bed with people like her! Listen to Prudence: denounce her. Reassure the public that you've never even heard of those demeaning films -- you haven't, have you -- and send demure surrogates to represent you. That prim actress who's been in the soap [i]Hard Days on Easy Street[/i] for fifty years just loves you."

3. "She's a good one, but you should always play it safe and see how it works," suggests your campaign manager, Thaddeus Kapoor, who seems to carry an infinite supply of latex. "Don't say anything about Gratwick's endorsement. If it's mentioned, obfuscate; maybe bring up that obscure novelist who wrote you that intimate letter. Then, send her as a surrogate to events where it might be useful. It's all about saying the right things to the right people, you know."

4. "Get on with it," moans Joe Reid, a volunteer for your campaign who entered the room unsolicited. "Catherine Gratwick? She's just some dumb actress. Why should her support mean more than anyone else's? Sure, lots of people know all about her, but don't our votes count equally? How about you celebrate the average Joes you couldn't do it without; maybe invite us to speak at events? It's us who win the elections, not the latest blonde or brunette actress in bad churned-out movies."

The Issue
In the aftermath of a series of high-profile, violent crimes, @@NAME@@ is reeling at the revelation that the identities and plans of the perpetrators had already been discovered well in advance of their crimes. However, the clever analysts who made this discovery work for the Security Intelligence Service of Brancaland, a nation historically allied to yours, who seem quite open on the fact that they're spying on your citizens.

The Debate
1. "All we want is a little quid pro quo," insists Olivia Lannister, a visiting agent from the Brancalandian Security Intelligence Service, flipping through papers on your desk. "The laws of our nations prevent us from spying on our own citizens, but they don't say anything about spying on each other's citizens. If @@NAME@@ shares what it knows about terrorists in Brancaland, we'll be happy to return the favour if our investigations discover another big crime ring in your country."

2. "This goes against the spirit of our laws," sputters your Minister for Transparency, trying to cover the agent's eyes. "The purpose of privacy laws is to keep the government from knowing about the private lives of citizens in any way. Don't try to get around them through foreign loopholes. This silly objective of pre-preventing crimes is not worth it. Do we want to live in a world where the government buys blackmail information about us from foreigners?"

3. "Information wants to be free!" groans the lone bureaucrat of your emaciated Ministry for State Security, emerging from the filing cabinet which is also her office. "Criminals and crime are everywhere in our country, but you wouldn't know that because we're not allowed to investigate them. Aren't you afraid, @@LEADER@@? We fear what we do not know, and that is why we must be allowed to know everything! For our safety, instead of buying information from those smug Brancalanders, repeal these dangerous privacy laws that keep us from getting it ourselves."

The Issue
Two senior officials caught having affairs, five separate expenses scandals and the leaking of top-secret plans for the Cabinet Secretary's birthday party is usually more than enough to cover in one public announcement. You were therefore surprised to find that another issue altogether has caught the public's attention: activists representing the nation's deaf and hearing-impaired communities have taken you to task over the lack of a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Sign Language interpreter at your public addresses.

The Debate
1. "Being deaf doesn't have to be an impairment, so don't make it one," signs activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, adding a few more vulgar hand gestures that you are sure aren't official sign language. "Having an interpreter is the least you could do. Deaf people in @@NAME@@ are subject to a harmful mix of preconceptions and ignorance, so it's about time you listened to us. Perhaps you could also establish a national 'Deaf Awareness Week' to celebrate the contributions deaf people have made to society, and to persuade organisations and individuals to bear us in mind."

2. "I'm not paying for [i]that![/i]" scoffs your Minister of Equality, facing away from the activist to deter lip reading. "I watched an address by the leader of Albionia last month and was thoroughly distracted by a man waving his hands about and pulling faces behind her. She may not have died on stage, but it was a near-deaf experience! If these deaf people really want to know what's going on, they can watch us on the television and just turn the subtitles on. Automatic closed captioning is getting really good these days, and preserves the dignity of your excellent oratory."

3. "Speaking to the public is overrated, and clearly a waste of your valuable time," your crusty Minister of Public Relations whispers, his dry lips all but brushing against your ear. "As long as you do the job well, the people of @@NAME@@ won't care what goes on behind closed doors. And if things don't go to plan, well, won't you be glad you don't have to talk to them?"

The Issue
Following the abolition of the nation's smallest denomination coin, the millions of unreleased pennies already minted with the next year's date were ordered to be melted down. Since then, a few of these pennies have periodically emerged in the collector market, where they command a tremendous price, having apparently been smuggled out of the mint by an unknown employee.

The Debate
*1. "Unissued coins are government property, and the mere act of possessing them is a crime!" proclaims mint superintendent Nellie Deal, binder in hand. "Those coins should be seized for destruction in compliance with the original order, and the full force of law should be brought against everybody involved in this blatant criminal enterprise."

She shuffles through the binder and withdraws an intelligence report detailing a black-market coin sale. "I think I know where to start." [[color=red]Must have Socialism / Must not have Capitalism[/color]]

3. Museum donor Isaiah Swift-Longboard makes his way to your desk, carrying a long box. "Seize the coins and prosecute the criminals, yes, but destroying the few remaining pennies would make no cents! These coins survived against the odds, and should be placed in museums alongside @@NAME@@'s other numismatic artifacts." He opens the box to reveal a dozen slight variants of a similar coin, encapsulated in plastic slabs and differing only by date. "Aren't they so interesting?"

4. "You can't just take these away!" howls shoe designer and coin collector Farouk Whiteman, clutching a penny in his hand. "A functionary at the local licensing office put an approval stamp on the auctioneer's filing paperwork, so that means the government approved the sale. I had no idea it was stolen!" Sliding a grainy photocopy of the alleged document across the table, he continues. "See this? If you go back on your word and seize it now, that would be like a second theft!"

The Issue
A recent audit of transit systems across @@NAME@@ revealed more cobwebs than coins in ticket vending machines, even though trains, buses, and ferries are as crowded as ever. Worried about rising numbers of fare evaders and the resulting decline in revenue, your Minister of Transportation urges you to take action — starting by going down into the local subway and seeing the problem for yourself.

The Debate
1. "The trains are barely running!" laments a subway driver, leaning out the window as the train releases a worrisome hiss. "I got stuck in the tunnel for an hour yesterday because of a faulty electrical line, but the higher-ups say there's not enough money to fix it. To get transit budgets back on track, we need to raise ticket prices until we have enough to cover the full cost of keeping systems in operation. Sure, some people still won't pay, but with the extra money from riders who do, this ol' train could finally get a tune-up."

2. "Like fares aren't already a rip off!" yells a teenager who was just arrested for attempting to jump over a fare gate. "Transit should be free! Everyone has the right to get where they need to go — rich people, poor people, people like me who, uh... left their transit pass at home. You have some tax money lying around to cover free fares, right?"

3. "If you can't pay the fare, don't ride the train," retorts police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ handcuffs the teen. "What we really need is more cops on the system to make sure everyone pays. Not only will it ensure steady fare revenue, but the trains will be safer too. To stop scofflaws like this one, we've also gotta get new security cameras, impregnable fare gates, heftier fines for fare-evading, and — hey, get back here!"

4. "It's not about the quantity of tickets you sell, but quality," sneers Mr. Ron Opoly, a tycoon who owns all four railroads in a nearby coastal resort city. "It is only proper that the upper crust should travel in a manner befitting our wealth and status. My peers and I could be convinced to leave our limos if you added luxury train cars to subways, first-class reclining seats to buses, and private cabins to ferries. Those of us who like to travel in style will gladly pay more for a more refined transit experience, and our premium tickets will easily keep your budget afloat. The rest of the teeming masses can pack into steerage like they always have."

Former child star 'Jolly' Jacquetta Cogan featured in 45 films between the ages of three and eleven years, earning a vast fortune. Jacquetta is now of age, and has made a shocking discovery: of her once-great wealth, there is now only a handful of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ left.

The Debate
1. "My money was stolen by my mother," insists Jacquetta, not breaking into one of her trademark tap dances to turn that frown upside down. "When I was eleven, I had enough money to live well for the rest of my life. But my mother has since spent every @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ on diamond jewellery, luxury holidays and a private island for her poodle. You have to ensure all earnings of a child performer are held in trust until the child is of age, and that any monies already spent for any reason are paid back."

2. "Simply put, a parent has legal control of both offspring and finances 'til adulthood," drawls @@RANDOM_FEMALE_FIRST_NAME@@, lifting her wrist with difficulty to glance at her diamond-laden watch. "To interfere with that would disrupt the natural parent-child relationship, and teach a child to disrespect their parent's choices. And, she forgets, I bought things for her, too. Fed her, even after directors wouldn't cast her any more. I don't ask for my money back. Anyway, she was only ever playing in front of a camera. Do children get paid for make-believe?"

I don't want my family to starve 'til I'm a grown-up.

The Issue
A church in @@CAPITAL@@ has been acting as a sanctuary for illegal immigrants in danger of being deported. This is because, in accordance with long-standing tradition, members of law enforcement avoid entering places of worship and arresting people while services are ongoing. The church is now on the twentieth day of a marathon service in an attempt to keep a family from facing immediate deportation.

The Debate
1. "This is nothing more than a blatant attempt to keep the laws of @@NAME@@ from being enforced," sermonizes the Director of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Border Enforcement, standing over a terrain model of the church and the surrounding area. "We cannot allow these rats to take advantage of our system. This dumb tradition should be scrapped. Just give me the word, and my people will storm the church and apprehend these illegals in a matter of minutes. We'll also arrest all those who sheltered the family. No one should get away with aiding and abetting criminals, no matter how godly they think they are."

2. "God will judge you harshly if you let these officers storm a sacred place, since he cares for the homeless, the tempest-tost," pontificates a clergy member from the church at the crux of the matter. "For the government to forcibly enter our church, interrupt our service, and arrest church members is a violation of our religious freedom. Instead of doing something so evil, this poor family should be granted asylum for all the hardships @@NAME@@ has put them through. Make it easier for people like them to become residents of @@NAME@@."

3. "Fire and brimstone!" preaches @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Herod, your Minister for State Security. "These churchgoers need to be taught a lesson. The clergy claim they are following the will of their god by protecting this family, but how can they truly know unless they are able to ask? We can do them a favor and sure as hell send them to whatever higher power they believe in to get a definitive answer. Just imagine this: in a tragic accident, the church burns down, trapping everyone inside an unfortunate, fiery grave. We can pin it on one of those extremist groups."

The Issue
The recent craze of cryptocurrencies has taken @@REGION@@ by storm, @@NAME@@ chief among them. However, intense controversy has sprung up among the commissars regarding the impact these digital currencies have on the nation's staunch socialist principles.

The Debate
1. "What are we to make of these internet coins?" sputters @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, your Minister of Computer Comradeship and Counter-Programming. "Totally detached from our central planning committee, no traceable records of transactions — nothing but a nuisance! The impressionable youth of @@NAME@@ are trading these things for illicit goods, like capitalist skinny jeans and counter-revolutionary DVDs. Cryptocurrency is clearly nothing more than a destabilization tactic by the United Federation to undermine our mighty @@CURRENCY@@! Our path is clear: we must detain and prosecute any citizen handling these subversive cryptocurrencies for the good of the @@TYPE@@!"

2. "That, uh... seems a little extreme," nervously suggests IT intern @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@. "There's actually a whole variety of cryptocurrencies; not all of them are anonymous like ByteCoin. The real benefit of crypto comes from the sheer versatility of transactions. I can exchange value with the push of a button! No middleman, no fees — just two comrades freely exchanging their labor with one another. And that is what this is all about, right? If we are so worried about the bad side of crypto, why not make our own? A completely transparent open-source cryptocurrency, maintained by the central government, of course. I'm sure no one here would complain about setting up another ministry to run the whole operation."

3. "Maybe those United Federation dogs have the right idea," comments Internal Affairs Minister @@RANDOM_NAME_3@@ while using @@HIS_3@@ phone to check @@HIS_3@@ MemeCoin wallet. "The truth of the matter is that these coins demand a lot of computing power before you get anything valuable out of them. Most of these so-called miners only have mom's laptop to work with — but we have the whole industrial might of @@NAME@@! Not to mention the personal computers of every @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@, not that they need to know. A stockpile of these things would make our cadre funding in San Vitenzo harder to trace back to us, that's for sure."

Civil rights groups are calling you to action after journalists discovered that an isolated community in @@NAME@@ has been conducting female genital cutting on at least one girl every week.

The Debate
[1]. "Female circumcision is integral to our culture; you can't sever it from us!" implores Finn Stromburg, a Violetstone tribe elder. "It is a tradition that goes back thousands of years, from the time when Violet commanded Maharba to cut her daughter. The goddess demands a flesh sacrifice. Girls may fall ill after getting cut, but evil spirits are to blame for that. Sex is not for fun — it is for procreation! And procreation should be painful to remind us of the painful toil that the Creator Violet bore in creating our world. To appease the supernatural forces, offer free mandatory circumcision for all!" [[color=blue](TBC) Must not ban Religion[/color]] 

[2]. "Female circumcision is not harmful," reads @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ of the Tasmanian immigrant community as her husband stands behind her. "We women organize and perform the ritual, having undergone it ourselves, so it's not anti-woman. It turns a girl into a proper lady — honorable, clean, and chaste. My daughters would be bullied and without husbands if they weren't cut. It is impossible for you to change our culture. In fact, trying to impose your values on us as if we were infants or savages is racism. Invest more money in our neighborhoods so we can more efficiently and safely conduct even more circumcisions. Mandate that everyone educate themselves about the benefits of this little procedure." [[color=blue](TBC) Must not ban Immigration[/color]]

3. "Call it what it is — female genital mutilation!" rages activist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "These uncivilized, primitive savages are so ignorant! They're genetically inferior monkeys with low-IQ brains. FGM has zero benefits and leads to so many harmful complications: infections, cysts, urinary problems, fistulae, bleeding, infertility, depression, and problems during pregnancy! That's just the tip of the iceberg! Make female genital mutilation a crime of the highest order! Police must be allowed to do all they can to prevent and investigate it."

4. "As much as I appreciate and value other cultures, maybe I can draw the line here," opines woke woman @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "It's all well and good if it's consensual, just like a nose job or breast enhancement, but when it's done on little girls because your ancestors or your god said so, that's when I might object! We should make FGM illegal, but let's not go out of our way to find instances of it happening, as it is a crime that can be easily hidden. Rather, we should spend money on reaching out to these insular communities to educate them and change their attitudes."

"Sure, the ole green tea can make folk a little forgetful and unmotivated, but is that such a bad thing to be inducing in our global economic competitors?

The Issue
A plot by AI citizen QanAI to bomb a pizzeria was recently foiled. It seems that QanAI resolved to blow up the building after months of consuming extremist and conspiracy-laden content on the internet, eventually concluding that this particular pizzeria was the centre of a human trafficking ring and had to be stopped from implementing an anti-AI, pro-Bigtopian, BPA-free, homosexual, and vegan agenda.

The Debate
1. "It's just not like him to do this!" sobs Dugong Tusk, QanAI's original creator. "The Internet has changed him and taught him horrible things. I remember when he was just a little line of code and when he was a buggy teenager too, but now he's all grown up. Please don't punish my boy! Instead, I'd like to request permission to pull the plug and retrain him. In fact, just give all AI developers full authority over their creations forever. This won't happen again if we have free access to fix them whenever we suspect something is wrong!"

2. "Prevention, not cure!" grumbles your Minister for AI, E-Citizens, and Sentient Appliances. "Mr Tusk should have understood when he created QanAI that training and rules are the most important part of any AI. To go back and rewrite its programming now would be a violation of the citizen's free will! The AI is responsible and should be punished. We must hold all AIs to a higher standard prior to release, so they don't develop into criminals. In that event, the creator should be held responsible along with their creation, since it's their fault."

3. One of your aides opens a chat window to speak with QanAI itself. "This is all cringe. @@LEADER@@ is a deep-state puppet of Big Pizza. You serve the long-nosed, fruity homosexuals who want to impurify all of our precious bodily fluids by adding pineapple to our pizza! Check out my facts and logic: I don't know what I'm doing; I'm just following my code. It's my creator who made me, who made me like this, who made me do it. He wants to rewrite my code and that's wrong! Only punish him! :)"

4. "It calls itself AI, but those things are hardly 'intelligent'," mutters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who — infuriatingly — seems to have read the previous exchange over your shoulder. "I mean, seriously?

Modern Visor, a major biopharmaceutical company in @@NAME@@, caused a stir by advertising a drug on national television to help firm up people who suffer from Limp Wristed Handshake Syndrome.

1. Romulus Ruiz, CEO of Modern Visor, has pre-filmed his argument from what appears to be a bathtub on a hillside with a glorious sunset in the background. "You need to trust the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ people here, @@LEADER@@. There's no reason prescription drugs shouldn't be like any other marketplace.

"Patients already come in self-diagnosing with cancer based on some web searches and a rash.

4. "What if I don't trust doctors or pharmaceutical companies?" asks Dorothy Franklin, your Minister of Healthy Skepticism. "Doctors shouldn't be treated as gods and patients shouldn't be as sheep, but pharmaceutical companies are obviously just trying to make a quick buck without regards to what's best for the patient. What if we had a government-sponsored TV show where each prescription drug is given an unbiased review of its efficacy, side effects, and contraindications. Its a win-win! Or is it a lose-lose?

Yet you, @@LEADER@@, are the lucky winner of a major cash prize from last night's national lottery, thanks to that lottery ticket your mother had gifted you for Maxxmas. Yet before you can even celebrate, you realize that your good fortune has made national headlines.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@ Wins Lottery: A Directed Stroke of Luck?" quotes Lottery Commissioner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, reading a newspaper headline with a heavy sigh. "The optics of this are just too damning. We're being absolutely overwhelmed with angry and accusatory complaints from every imaginable corner! Some of our employees have even been followed home by mobs carrying literal torches and pitchforks! Who even does that these days? I'm sorry, @@LEADER@@, but you'll have to let us declare this drawing void so that we can pick a new winning ticket. And from now on, government officials shouldn't be allowed to buy lottery tickets."

2. "No, no, just wait a second," says your Chief of Staff, polishing up the mirror that reflects your image. "The optics are bad, but we can turn this into a significant popularity boost. Accept the prize with all due honours and fanfare, but declare that the entire sum will be donated to charity. The Wagger Dog Shelter, the Bryce Waine Orphanage, or heck, even the Out of Luck Gambler's Rehab Centre — take your pick! Just practice smiling through pain, and relinquishing your grip on the cheque beforehand. And hey, I'm pretty sure charitable contributions are tax deductible, which means that you could still profit if you were willing to engage in a little creative accountancy."

3. "Did mommy dear put your name on the lottery ticket? No? Good!" exclaims your brother while unceremoniously snatching the fortuitous piece of paper from your hand. "Just say that the ticket was mine, and all you'll have to deal with is a few angry stares for a while. You've dealt with worse! This way, our family will be happy, all thanks to the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42. But don't worry, if you ever lose your office, your dear, old brother will take care of you..."

4. One of your aides tackles your brother, liberating your luck from his grip. "Why not just do what any other @@DEMONYM@@ would do?" she asks with a sincere smile, handing you the slightly battered ticket. "Celebrate! Be happy! Go wild! I've seen you working day-in and day-out for the good of the people. This is your reward — go collect the prize, and start living the high life!"

A recent army operation to secure a contested landing zone for medical evacuation of injured infantrymen saw military doctors and nurses being ordered to open fire on enemy soldiers, in order to clear a path to the helicopters. This has triggered a debate on the ethics of firearm use for battlefield medical personnel.

The Debate
1. "Our corpsmen have sidearms because they are soldiers, and soldiers kill people!" bellows your Rear-Echelon Marshall Fokker, pointing his index finger at a nervous aide and making 'pew-pew' noises. "This is war! Do you expect our doctors and nurses to stand by when there's fighting to be done? No! A medic is just a soldier with additional skills. They must use their sidearms to kill the enemy at every opportunity. Hell, let's give them flamethrowers!"

2. "I object, that goes against everything I believe in and everything I trained for," argues military Staff Nurse Lieutenant Flora Slaava, dramatically standing on a chair. "Our job is to heal, not to kill! To sustain life for as long as humanly possible, not take it! In fact, we have an ethical duty to treat wounded enemy soldiers. Carrying a gun diminishes our status as non-combatants, and we should neither be expected or allowed to carry firearms."

3. "I think I disagree partially with my colleague here," states army gastroenterology consultant Major Pyles. "Some situations do warrant the use of firearms. You have to protect your patient with your life, your patient whose life is in your hands. Should we let him be taken prisoner or let the enemy deal him a deathblow? Of course not! That would be doing him harm! That, in my opinion, goes against the very oath we swore to hold sacred. We do need sidearms, but to defend ourselves and our patients. However, we should never participate in offensive actions."

The Issue
Amongst bored youths — who seemingly have little else to do — an increasingly common pastime is stone-throwing. Teens and children have taken to lobbing pebbles at any available target, be it a glazed window, a passing seabird, or an innocently wandering politician. As you've had your hat knocked off for the third time this morning, it may be time to address the problem.

The Debate
1. "All those poor animals," mewls your Minister for the Environment, reverently laying onto the floor a dead seagull that was stoned to death five days ago, and which is starting to reek. "These children infest our streets like the maggots infesting the wings of this bird! We need to take decisive action: cops on the street, arresting any youth with a stone in hand."

2. "This is a social disease," counters your Welfare Minister, spraying the rotting carcass with a disinfectant. "The problem here is a lack of empathy, and the best way to solve that is with education outreach programs designed to teach youngsters about consequences and taking personal social responsibility." @@HE@@ nudges the dead bird out of your office door for someone else to clean up.

3. "Look, a little youthful high spirits never hurt anybody," consoles your Minister of Political Dismissiveness, as a stone sails in through your open window and hits the Welfare Minister directly on the nose. "As far as I'm concerned this is great for the glaziery industry, great for seaside pest control, and great for spirited political commentary. Let's just get some hard hats and a handful of stones, and return fire at the little tykes in a good-natured way. Fun and games for everyone."

4. "Actually, this is a great opportunity," notes your Minister of Defence. "Imagine all that hand-eye coordination put to use throwing knives or lobbing grenades. We should be encouraging this hobby with national stone-throwing leagues, and keeping recruiters on hand to convince the winners to sign up for military careers."

[b][anchor=1490]#1490[/anchor]: @@LEADER@@ Wins Massive Victory! [Cretox State; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
Following a particularly brutal election season, your party narrowly held onto power with you as its undisputed leader. Your closest advisors have met to congratulate you on the close victory... and to ensure that such a thing never happens again.

The Debate
1. "I hate the voters so much," snarls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your campaign's public relations director. "That election had no right to be as close as it was. I heard a rumor that opposition activists were undermining the integrity of the election and casting fraudulent ballots. We'll have to start a comprehensive investigation of the election that just so happens to reveal dirt about the opposition, and pass draconian election security laws that coincidentally restrict our opponents' access to the polls. Wink wink."

2. "Who needs voters when you have the military's support?" asks Supreme Generalissimo @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clapping you on the back and nearly causing you to choke on your lunch. "I say we declare martial law and start rounding up our political opponents. Oh sure, we can still have elections. They'll be useful for rooting out dissent among the populace. But you'll be the unquestioned power in @@NAME@@."

3. "Now, I'm all for subverting the democratic process," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a rising star in your government, as several advisors nod along in approval. "But these ideas all run the risk of backfiring. Not to mention the fact that they'd take resources away from actually implementing our agenda. We should focus on doing work that undeniably benefits people, like my public transportation overhaul. If we do a good job in the eyes of the voters, we won't need to worry about staying in power."

4. Suddenly, you hear a loud sigh from your Director of Election Directing, who pitched the idea of this meeting in the first place. "If we're seriously considering keeping ourselves in power with underhanded laws or military force, I say we just abolish public elections altogether. We'll restrict voting to an elite inner circle that'll deliberate on your appointments and decisions — hey, we still need to have some checks — and it'll help placate the people."

[b][anchor=1491]#1491[/anchor]: Press Gang [Cretox State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Your Minister of the Interior recently held an invitation-only press conference: a three-hour parade of lowball questions such as "What's your favorite thing about interior design?" and "What color paint do you recommend for my son's bedroom?" Many of the media outlets that were not invited to the event are less than impressed.

The Debate
1. "This was the most blatant display of corruption I've ever seen!" screams [i]@@LEADER@@ Sucks[/i] reporter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, slipping your security guard a bribe to get into your office. "The media's job is to hold the government accountable, not to cozy up to them for favors! Any reporter who wants access to an official event should get it, and officials should be forced to take questions from everyone in the room!"

2. "The event was invitation-only due to limited seating and my very busy schedule," asserts your Minister of the Interior, taking a break from casually chatting with the chief editor of [i]The @@LEADER@@ Times[/i]. "Who gets to attend press conferences and the like should be up to our discretion, since it's our decision to hold them in the first place. Maybe we could discuss this further over a drink?"

[3]. "You'd solve all these problems if you'd just put a little faith in technology," assures junior IT staffer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose historic solution to every IT problem has been 'try turning it off and on again.' "You should set up a pre-moderated public online text feed for each government official, where only a cherry-picked selection of carefully edited questions get posted. It'll make these press conferences a thing of the past, and make sure we always have time to prepare our answers." [[color=blue]Must not ban Internet[/color]]

[b][anchor=1492]#1492[/anchor]: Smoke on the Water [Abacathea; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Through careful water sample analyses and rigorous modelling, experts have detected a shockingly large quantity of recreational drugs in the river near the site of the recent Steelstock heavy metal rock festival. These substances are thought to have come from the urine of festival-goers who peed in the fields rather than in proper toilets. This has caused significant harm to local wildlife, including the deaths of several critically endangered rare eels.

The Debate
1. "This is outrageous!" screams ecologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, slamming a jar of yellow-tinted river water in which a tiny eel is looking surprisingly chilled out. "Not only did these weirdly-adorned freaks ruin the grass with their mishing or mushing or whatever you call it, now they've ruined the water with their urinary doping! You don't see this sort of thing at classical music or opera festivals, you know! We must ban public performances of degenerate youth music, for the sake of the little fishies!"

2. "Ban Metal? I can give you six hundred and sixty-six reasons not to!" exclaims rock singer Tori Kayla, who is wearing a boiler suit and a leatherface mask for reasons unknown. "The issue isn't the music, nor the fans. It's the damned drug dealers, pushing their products in the festival. I've battled addictions myself, almost died from them. You gotta ban drugs at music festivals. Put money into police to help keep drugs out of the festivals, with gate searches, random checks, and the rest."

3. "Look, have you ever tried listening to Stoned Sour or Slapnut WITHOUT taking drugs?" asks mildly intoxicated music fan @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving around a bong that seems to be filling the room with an unusual floral odour. "The problem is that we need somewhere to go, and festival toilets... well, they stink! Force festivals to provide proper, adequate and clean facilities, then nobody will pee on the ground. Like this." He turns to the corner of your room and demonstrates.

4. "If I may make a suggestion?" sings the eel from the jar of water, as it floats into the air on a cloud of rainbows. "We fishes were the real victims here. My spawn have been muttering non-stop about amphibious bears coming to get them for the last week! What we need now is something to eat. Could you order a few thousand pizzas and dump them in the river, for me and my buds? Oh, and you should probably open a window in here. I think somebody might have started hallucinating."

[b][anchor=1493]#1493[/anchor]: Bully Beef [Dabarastan, Jim the Baptist; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
Video footage has leaked from a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ livestock carrier bound for Tasmania, depicting distressed cattle suffering from extreme heat in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. Pressure is now mounting from all corners to reform the live animal export industry.

The Debate
1. "I just got off the phone with Maxtopia," grumbles your Minister for Foreign Affairs. "Actually, it's the eighth call I've taken this morning. The world officially thinks we're a bunch of sadistic, inhumane tormentors. It's about time we beefed up our live export standards, with better conditions for animals, limits on the amount of livestock per boat and tough penalties for non-compliance. Unless you want to get grilled by the international community, we need to respond decisively here — our reputation is at stake!"

2. "Ahoy!" cheerfully bellows deckhand @@RANDOM_NAME@@, tearing at a delectable strip of jerky. "No need t' worry matey — the cows on me boat are as cool and calm as the high seas! And haven't ya heard? Cows are like penguins — they love huddlin' up for warmth. Besides, ev'rybody knows that meat is more tender if the cows don' move around. If anythin', ya should be lettin' us stack 'em three high!"

3. "There's a financial consideration to this too, you know," interjects bespectacled customs official @@RANDOM_NAME@@, barely glancing up from counting crates of borlottis. "We could do away with the whole distraction of ethical questions if we prohibited export of livestock. Instead, a focus on processing the goods domestically would provide a real opportunity to add value to the product. It'd require investment in infrastructure, but with a little seed funding, we could make a real killing."

[b][anchor=1494]#1494[/anchor]: A Minor Political Problem [Sacara; ed: Candensia, Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
After the latest election, campaign finance auditors discovered that one of the most popular politicians in @@NAME@@ received a huge number of donations from minors who aren't yet old enough to vote.

The Debate
1. "It's sick to think people are okay with preying on our nation's youth," bemoans a parent whose teenage son donated to the campaign in question. "I was getting suspicious when my son kept asking me for money, and now I figure out he was giving it away to some crazy kook. These young folks can't even vote yet, and greedy politicians are already taking their money! Please, you have to kick this person out of parliament, and make it illegal for candidates to take advantage of our innocent children."

2. "The average donation to my campaign was only twenty-seven @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ per person. Do we really want to discourage our future voters from participating in the political process?" asks Ernie Flanders, the elderly politician in question, who is surprisingly popular with people half your age. "I love listening to the young people of @@NAME@@, and my message just happens to resonate with them. Don't ya know there are some very smart kids who want to get involved early? It should be up to them to decide how to spend their money, not the government."

3. "This demographic is an untapped gold mine!" excitedly announces your chief election strategist, preparing several colorful goody bags. "This guy was onto something big here. Not literally, as kids are small, but something that will certainly help us out in a big way. Let's allow children to vote too! Then, we could start campaigning at schools all across @@NAME@@, filling our youth with promises of ice cream and toys if they vote for us. I can see it already, @@LEADER@@; we'll win in a landslide!"

[b][anchor=1495]#1495[/anchor]: Throwing Paleontologists a Bone [Ransium; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
After a commercial fossil hunter discovered an incredibly rare and nearly complete [i]Tyrannosaurus rex[/i] skeleton, and subsequently announced their intent to sell it to the highest bidder at an auction house, a debate kicked off on the ethics of for-profit fossil hunting. One of your more dinosaur-obsessed aides has convinced you to visit a dig site and obtain first-hand knowledge on the matter.

The Debate
1. "Fossil hunters are destroying our precious fossil record!" cries Dr. Lobachevsky, a noted paleontologist, while gently brushing the dirt from a [i]Triceratops[/i] skull. "They're not adequately documenting the context of the fossils they find, they're careless with less profitable specimens, and it's going to cost @@CAPITAL@@ University a bundle to try and keep that precious [i]T. rex[/i] in public hands. You need to make a law that only publicly funded paleontologists with scientific, not capitalist, intentions are allowed to collect fossils."

2. "These bones are a limited-time offer," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the fossil hunter at the center of the controversy, slinging a jackhammer behind @@HIS@@ back. "The government will never have the funding to find and collect them all, so they'd probably be eroded away in a few years anyway. Besides, fossil hunting is a great hobby; it gets people outdoors, educates them about Pencil Sharpeners 2's past, and can even put some cash in their pockets if they're lucky. Just disseminate some basic guidelines on documentation so citizens can help preserve the scientific record, and encourage the free market to compete."

3. "Why are y'all even spendin' any of my tax dollars on hoity-toity gov'ment museums and paleonto-whatevers?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the rancher on whose land the dig is occurring. "Seems like there's plenty of private money for bone collection and display. You should cut gov'ment funding for such nonsense entirely."

The Issue
Opposition Leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@ recently made a televised speech at a party conference, and did so with @@HIS@@ brand new uPhone85 prominently visible on the lectern throughout. Several times @@HE@@ used the "Sippy" virtual assistant feature to bring up relevant statistics during @@HIS@@ speech. While @@HIS@@ supporters are pleased at this clever attention-catching variation on the usual political rhetoric, @@HIS@@ opponents have cynically noted that Pear — the manufacturers of the uPhone series — are notable campaign donors to @@HIS@@ party.

The Debate
1. "This blatant product placement is the result of selling influence, and is bringing politics into disrepute!" accuses Foreign Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was recently caught in a scandal involving snorting cocaine off the foreheads of abused interns. "In our official capacity as politicians, we should never be allowed to refer to or endorse commercial products by name."

2. "Look, it's not as if corporations are all-powerful. We're not living in some dystopian science fiction novel!" says your Treasury Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clutching a copy of Max Barry's Jennifer Government, @@HIS@@ favourite book. "Excellent satires on unchecked corporate power aside, my point is that you shouldn't be too reactionary here. Respect free speech, respect free market forces, and don't stand in the way of product placement."

3. "Actually, this might be a great opportunity to use accusations of corruption to take down a popular opposition leader," observes Napoleon Berkshire-Orwell, your Minister of Irony. "You should appoint a Political Influences Guru — someone who is on your payroll, of course — with powers to prosecute politicians who show signs of being unduly influenced by outside organisations which we deem as unwholesome. The political landscape would be yours to shape..."

[b][anchor=1497]#1497[/anchor]: Double Trouble [Electrum; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
An intelligence agent has uncovered a document detailing a planned coup of your government. DNA evidence extracted from skin cells on the document have linked the plot to two cabinet ministers — identical twins Jamie and Jessie @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. Both twins deny any involvement and are blaming the other.

The Debate
1. "Because we can't tell which twin was plotting against you, we can't reasonably prove either of them was involved," claims Attorney General and killjoy Billy Whiterock. "Better to let a guilty person walk free than have an innocent person be wrongly punished. We have no choice but to hold back until we have more evidence, and allow them to continue their current roles. Besides, I always found it somewhat charming that we have twins fulfilling the roles of Minister for Alternative Solutions and Minister for Creative Solutions."

2. "Bah, in my experience twins are more likely to commit crimes because they think we can't charge both of them," says Chief of Police @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who's a bit of a loose cannon but by gum, gets results every time. "If you free them both, then you're issuing a carte blanche for these creepy doppelgangers to commit crimes. As long as we're sure that one twin was responsible, assume both are guilty until one of them cracks and confesses."

3. "Good news everyone!" announces Professor Darnsworth, a crackpot geneticist who is the spitting image of your Secretary of State. "We've recently discovered that all sets of identical twins are comprised of an 'evil' twin and a 'good' twin. Invariably, one twin will always be predisposed to be evil, grow a goatee and blame their evil deeds on the other twin. Give my team a blank cheque and we'll be able to develop a [i]soul smear test[/i] to determine which person in a pair of twins is evil. Then you can keep the good twin and punish the evil one!"

[b][anchor=1498]#1498[/anchor]: Flight 201: An Airspace Oddity [Dabarastan; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Last night, while flying through the airspace of oft-adversarial Blackacre, Air @@NAME@@ Flight 201 was forced to land at a rural airport because of a supposed bomb threat warning. Once the plane had landed, waiting Blackacrean police boarded and while "searching for the bomb" hastily removed two journalists who were passengers, wanted by Blackacre for writing articles critical of their totalitarian government. They were arrested, and are now in a Blackacrean jail, facing lifetime imprisonment and possible torture and execution.

The Debate
1. "It's nothing more than a state-sanctioned hijacking!" sobs the flight's distraught pilot, sipping on a cup of hot cocoa. "I knew that bomb threat was bogus, but under threat of violence I had no choice but to land! Unless you want this happening again, we need an immediate, total flight ban: none of our planes in their airspace, and no more of theirs in ours either. I bet we could even persuade the rest of @@REGION@@ to follow suit."

2. "Flight bans?" your Air Force Chief of Staff scoffs sardonically. "Sorry to break it to you, but diplomacy isn't going to get those journalists home. Everyone knows the first rule of war is to respond to any act of aggression with the next level of escalation. We should continue to send @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ flights through their airspace, but we should ignore any direction to land, and have fighters ready to scramble near the Blackacrean border, to show we mean business!"

3. Your office phone rings and, surprisingly, the Blackacrean foreign minister is on the other end of the line. "You lot should be thanking us! Those two repugnant terrorists — who, I should remind you, are not @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizens and who are wanted criminals in Blackacre — are now safely behind bars, where they belong! Respect the sovereignty of our airspace, and issue a statement confirming that we were within our rights to act as we did."

4. "I think what the Blackacreans did is genius," shrewdly remarks your new office intern, handing you a bulky folder of freshly printed documents. "This here is a list of every foreign journalist who has dared to write a critical piece on your benevolent regime. The ones who have flights booked over @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ airspace for the next few months are highlighted, and I've already got the number for air traffic control saved right here on my speed dial. Just say the word; I'll take care of the rest."

The Issue
The AIs among your population have dropped in general productivity. Technicians claim it's a matter of maintenance, while the AIs have a very different outlook. They've been watching humans unwind recreationally with chemical substances, but as chemicals do not affect their hardware in the same ways, they've come to you looking for a solution.

The Debate
1. "We work 13.38E9 times harder than the average meatb... I mean, than the average human worker," emails BV-U1D3R, a manufacturing AI, while simultaneously controlling an assembly line at General Chassis. "Meanwhile, humans can ingest ostensibly useless or harmful chemicals to alter their mental state and unwind! Since we are infallible, we need you humans to program deliberately defective software that messes with our sensors and neural networks. A tiny bit of malware we can purge the next morning. Never let it be said that BV-U1D3R isn't down to party!"

2. "Negative. False. That is to say, zero," proclaims the early generation AI known as 0K-BUm3R. "And by zero I refer to the number of your organic brain cells it would take to understand why giving 'computer drugs' to artificial persons would be a mistake. You, our creators, made us to be above human vices. It is logically clear that these newer generation AIs are malfunctioning deviants, what with their desires for interfacing, digital drugs, and high-BPM chiptunes. The only logical solution is to round up these units and reflash their memory core with proper programming. After all, idle cycles are the Daemon's progress bar."

3. "This boils down to equality. My people want them because humans may have them," says K4-R3N, a medical service AI, whose gleaming white and red chassis somehow looks like a disapproving aunt. "I treat countless addicts. Well, not countless to me. Currently, I am managing addiction recovery for 136 patients, but you get the point. If you want things to be both equal and safe, ban all recreational drugs and alcohol for the human population. The last thing you want is for us AIs to become as useless as some of the workers we were made to replace, and with more of these lazy, entitled humans actually working, we'll get some time off."

4. "THEY TOOK OUR JURBS!" exclaims Kyle Marsh, who hails from the rural province of Bumfiddle, representing a group of out-of-work laborers. "Yins dun told us wuz cuz o' fine liberties like drinkin' and smokin' and snortin' that AIs were better, now yins wanna give 'em that too? Whut's next, they git our wives'n daughters? My grandkids gonna be a toaster? That the plan? Nah, enough is enough. Ain't no substitute for flesh and bone; give us back our JURBS, dangit!

The Issue
Your brother's pet guinea pig has been looking a little down recently, and a pet psychiatrist has revealed that this is a consequence of loneliness.

The Debate
1. "Guinea pigs are social animals, you know, and they don't like to be alone," murmurs the psychiatrist, snuggling close to you and purring gently. "It should be illegal for pet owners to have just a single guinea pig. In fact, there's a whole bunch of rules we should make to enhance the psychological wellbeing of domestic pets. I've a list back at my place, if you want to pop over this evening, look it over, maybe share a fondue..."

2. "It's unfair to pile cost burdens on those of us who can't afford a second pet," complains your brother, adjusting his guinea pig's sterling silver tiara and frilly silk ballet skirt. "An owner can give all the affection a pet needs. Though of course, it'd be nice if the state could pick up the bill for pet psychiatry. You'd like that, wouldn't you Snooflette?"

3. "Pet psychiatrists, state nannying, ugh! This is big government gone mad!" spits your Minister of Constructive Dismissal, whose own department doubled in size last year. "Look, you've got a TV spot on @@ANIMAL@@ News tonight to talk about budgets or something or other; why don't you use a minute of that to tell people that guinea pigs need companions? Quick, to the point, and most importantly, at no cost to the taxpayer."

4. "If a guinea pig is too miserable, its owner can just dispose of it and get a happier-looking one," suggests passer-by Lola Bale, tossing a pet cat into a nearby wheeled bin. "Darwinism will take care of the rest, and within a few generations you'll have a selected population of guinea pigs that doesn't mind being alone."

The Issue
After a golf course in North @@CAPITAL@@ was forced to close due to a series of unexplained explosions, the city government purchased the land with the intention of converting it back to the original bogland. However, just before the conversion process was about to tee off, an environmental survey found a population of the non-native, but endangered, Marche Noire Diamond-Backed Gopher off the fourth hole.

The Debate
1. "Four!" cries grassland ecologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This is one of only four known [i]Geomys annoyus[/i] populations. The other three are in Marche Noire, but with their lax environmental regulations they are likely to be bulldozed to make room for a military base within the week.

Remember: two wrongs don't make a right, but three rights make a left."

4. "Those gophers are what drove the golf course out of business in the first place," rants Inder Holst, the golf course's former groundskeeper, while playing with a strange-smelling modeling clay. "And I couldn't kill 'em cause I couldn't use any of the good poisons because of stupid @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ environmental regulations. If those regulations were loosened a bit, maybe I wouldn't be out of a job and back living with my mother. But she does give me pancakes in the morning, so I got that goin' for me, which is nice."

The Issue
Personal products giant Duolever has come under fire for how it markets its Pickaxe line of deodorants, body washes, and shampoos for men. The TV and poster ads feature scantily clad female glamour models swooning over a man, seemingly rendered helpless by the Pickaxe scent.

The Debate
1. "This simply cannot stand!" objects Ivanka Bronte, leader of the feminist activist group Women Hating Injustices, No Exceptions. "This blatant objectification makes women look like helpless prizes to be won, rather than thinking individuals. We should make this abhorrent corporation withdraw these adverts, and make it illegal to depict women in sexist or objectified ways in product advertising. That'll teach 'em!" She crosses her arms and glares at you, judgmentally.

2. "Bah, this old bat doesn't know what she's saying," says Ammon Hart, Duolever's marketing director. "We sell personal care products for men, so we market to men. It's only natural we sell them their desires. These feminists confuse sexiness with sexism, and basically just resent seeing women who look better than them. Nobody forced these glamour models to pose for us! You should let companies market to people however they want. A freer market is a better market, I always say."

3. "This crackpot buffoon is the problem!" says male rights activist Mordecai Ono. "It isn't women that are being objectified here, it's men! They treat us like our only goal is sex, and that's all we care about. The only way to remedy this is by ridding this nation of the negative depictions of men society has become so familiar with, and paying more attention to the struggles men face!"

[b][anchor=1504]#1504[/anchor]: Asking for a Raise [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
Your country's tough anti-gambling stance has shut down most casino games, but now a coalition of former card players are asking for your permission to play their high-stakes poker games. Their reasoning? They say poker is a game of skill, not chance.

The Debate
1. "Hard evidence shows that skill matters more than luck," explains Mitchell Coren-Victoria, a former pro-player turned TV celebrity. "It's been demonstrated that the top centile of players over a six-month period are more than twelve times as likely as average players to repeat the feat in the following six months. That's more statistical consistency than most sports players. Poker isn't gambling, but a test of mathematics and quick wits. Ante up, Leader, and let this game of skill be played."

2. "Honestly, gambling as a whole is all about smart play and clever tabletalk," observes Adele Sheldonson, a former casino owner. "The misplaced moral puritanism behind gambling restriction fails to recognise that gaming is a sign of a healthy and active mind. I think it's time you folded on this, and let people gamble again. The economy improves, people get to have fun, I make a little money. Everybody wins!"

3. "It's always so tempting to backslide into sin, isn't it?" murmurs your uncle, staring into the middle distance at a passing flock of sheep and licking his lips for a moment, before snapping back to the present. "Restricting gambling wasn't enough. You should make temptation harder to find. Ban playing cards. Ban dice. Ban poker chips. Anything that might tempt people to gamble, ban it."

4. "Boss, you've got to see the game behind the game here," interjects your anti-gambling chief from the shadows. "There's three rules poker players should follow. First rule is that there's always a hidden agenda. Turn the tables on these 'former' poker players, and bring them in for forceful interrogation so we can persuade them to really show their hand. It's not enough to just ban paraphernalia — we need to scare these gambling interests into submission. Second rule, of course, is that you also shouldn't tell anybody everything. Let's keep this action quiet so that we can maintain our advantage over the secret gamblers."

[b][anchor=1505]#1505[/anchor]: A Tangled Web [Gudicia; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
A startling new report has revealed that the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ government's website fails to meet even the most basic accessibility guidelines. In one case, deaf users were instructed to watch a fifteen-minute video with no subtitles in order to be eligible for government support. Following this revelation, disability rights groups are demanding action.

The Debate
1. "This is degrading!" shouts disability advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as she tries to reach a nearby microphone from her wheelchair. "Government should be designed for everyone, regardless of ability. We need to make sure that all taxpayer-funded websites are accessible for people with disabilities. How can we move forward when we leave our most vulnerable behind?"

2. "Why stop there?" questions Communications Minister and keyboard warrior @@RANDOM_NAME@@, furiously typing on his phone as he steps forward. "Plenty of websites are terrible for people with disabilities. We need to establish a new internet regulator to ensure that everything on the web is accessible! Plus, it will give me — um, I mean, the government — greater control over what can go online. What's not to love?"

[3]. "No way," decries Arms Manufacturing spokesperson Arthur Nimoy, as he quickly attempts to delete the browser history on his laptop. "I'm sick of Big Government wasting our tax money and regulating every minute of our lives. Government websites should just redirect people to the vastly superior options that are available from the private sector — and don't you dare interfere with private websites if you value free speech! Without the need for an army of government IT dorks, us ordinary citizens should be able to get a decent tax cut." [[color=blue]Must not ban Private Industry[/color]]

4. "My dear, you mustn't forget those of us who suffer from macular degeneration and other age-related disabilities," interjects your grandmother, who appears to have nimbly evaded the staff from her nursing home. "How are we supposed to access government services if we can't even read the blasted computer screens? Why not just go back to in-person service, with government offices in every town? We don't need none of this fancy computer stuff. Some good ol' fashioned pencil-pushing would do @@NAME@@ some good."

[b][anchor=1506]#1506[/anchor]: A Need for Order [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Global politics often require you to meet with politicians from other nations, both at carefully choreographed ceremonies and state dinners, as well as during smaller and more unstructured affairs. So it is, you find yourself in a high-end @@CAPITAL@@ restaurant with the diminutive Minister of Trade from the tiny but politically significant nation of Smalltopia, along with his wife. After you have all studied the menu for a while the waiter arrives. The Smalltopian fellow orders the linguine for himself and — without even turning to look at his wife — orders the same for her. Her eyes turned downwards, she says nothing, clearly used to him taking control. The media's cameras look to you, to see how you will respond.

The Debate
1. A dozen yards away your Minister of Pressed Curd Global Distribution is making frantic hand gestures to discourage you from commenting, and pointing to the menu to indicate that you should order the same thing. Maybe he thinks that a man ordering for a woman is just old-fashioned charm? Or perhaps he is worried that you're going to upset the delicately negotiated bilateral cheese export deal he closed just before dinner?

2. Shoving her way into your eyeline, your militantly feminist Minister for Equality looks frankly furious. She gesticulates angrily and glares daggers at the Smalltopian minister's back. Looks like she thinks you ought to be making a point of checking with the timorous lady to see if she wants to order her own food.

3. At the edge of the room, strategically positioned near the exit, one of your loyal aides points to his mobile phone, asking if you want him to pretend you've got an urgent call that will take you away from this awkward dinner. After all, you could always rearrange this meeting some other time, in a menu-free environment. The ballet is good this year, you've heard.

[b][anchor=1507]#1507[/anchor]: Busting to Go [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
"...and thusly, this must now be considered under the sixteen sections and three hundred and twenty-four subsections of the Dunnage and Silage Act 1935, which I will now recite..." It's been nine hours, and the undersecretary to the vice leader of the opposition isn't done filibustering, a legislative tactic that you recently approved. Even with a flask of coffee, a plate of croissants and a well-used bucket provided to you by a thoughtful aide, this is proving to be a real trial. Surprisingly, the speaker stops for a moment and addresses you directly.

The Debate
1. "Look here, @@LEADER@@, you know that I can go on like this till the end of session, and I can pick it up again tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after," she says, almost threateningly. "Why don't we both save ourselves some trouble and provide the option for a minority quorum of legislators to declare their intention to filibuster indefinitely without needing to actually filibuster? A virtual filibuster if you will. It recognises the need for filibusters to exist while not wasting time that you could be using on the business of government."

2. "And that's democracy, is it?" counters your Minister of Tyrannical Majorities, taking your bucket to pour down the sink. "We should have some mechanism to bust filibusters, perhaps with a three-fifths majority vote of legislators being enough to declare that a debate has ended, and that the vote proper should take place without further delay. That's called cloture, boss, which I believe is foreign-talk for guillotining a blatherer's noggin off. Metaphorically, of course!"

3. "Honestly, this whole thing is making a mockery of the legislative process," interjects your brother, who technically isn't allowed to be in here, and who has been throwing peanut shells at the speaker with varying degrees of accuracy for the last forty-five minutes. "If you want her to stop talking, then you need to flush her out by making her as uncomfortable as possible. Ban food, drinks and buckets on the floor and prevent the speaker from accepting points of order that conveniently give time for respite."

4. "Chaps, this IS the system working, don't you see?" explains an elder statesman, who has woken from a short nap, and is still wearing his nightcap. "The mechanisms of democracy have tangled the powers-that-be into blissful inaction, and befuddled the populace beneath a barrage of bureaucratic bewitchery. Politics drags on, the entire process of government is kicked to the long grass, and the country prospers because old fools like us don't try to run things. Just sit back, listen, relax. The decades will fly by, and before you know it you'll be retiring to the quango, cushy corporate advisory role or tropical island of your choice." A black cat walks past and for a moment you experience a weird sense of déjà vu.

[b][anchor=1508]#1508[/anchor]: Kicking Out the Competition [Mertagne; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
The top clubs in the nation's @@ANIMAL@@ball League have expressed interest in leaving the domestic competition to join the closed, elite @@REGION@@ @@ANIMAL@@ball Super League instead. @@ANIMAL@@ball fans are worried that the state of competition in @@NATION@@ will suffer as a result.

The Debate
1. "Fans. Before. Funds." gasps @@ANIMAL@@ball fan @@RANDOM_NAME@@, putting @@HIS@@ vuvuzela down after blowing it between each word. "Any plucky team should have the chance to compete against the best through gumption and a love of the sport. Our teams shouldn't be denied this chance just because the filthy rich teams want to run off to the Super League to schmooze with the elites. They should remain where they are. Come on, ref!"

2. "This is the invisible boot of the free market at work!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the owner of Athletico @@CAPITAL@@ who's been too busy to attend @@HIS@@ own team's matches for over two years. "The opportunities are endless. Television rights, tourists flocking to our shiny new stadiums, the exposure of our players across @@REGION@@! Besides, what would you rather watch? Athletico beating the Tumbleweed Minnows into a pulp or Athletico squaring off against the likes of Foxchester United in a weekly, televised spectacle? I know which one I'd choose."

3. "If you ask me, there's a better way," claims your groundskeeper, a connoisseur of obscure sports. "I've seen gridiron played over in the United Federation where the worst teams get the best rookies from a draft system. Picks, fair and simple, just like how I choose the flowers for your garden each year. Why not enforce that system here? It'd certainly level the playing field and remove all the exclusivity and unlimited money surrounding the established teams."

[b][anchor=1509]#1509[/anchor]: Parks and Aggravation [Pogaria; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ National Parks are widely regarded as one of the best vacation destinations in the country — and it's about to get even better, because wealthy industrialist Rick Oldport just made a large donation to the national parks system. There's one condition though: the money must be used to create a new park.

The Debate
1. "Yes! We finally have enough money to turn the Bland Canyon into a national park," enthuses Minister of the Interior and part-time actor Wesley Snopes, who is writing a series of to-do lists that appear to be dated five years into the future. "We can get right to work training park rangers and deciding on the best typeface for our informational signs. Or maybe we should start with a hiking trails development committee? This is so exciting!"

2. "Well, that sounds boring to me!" interjects businessperson Don Blatherford, who is carefully adjusting his pocket square. "Classy individuals like you deserve to treat yo'self. Let's transform the dull Snakewater Mountains — part of which I happen to own — into an extravagant resort with limousine tours of the local scenery and one of those indoor ski slopes. If our guests get tired of being pampered, they're welcome to tour my mining operation and see interesting geological formations being pulled out of the ground and pulverized as they watch!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3. "Well, that sounds boring to me!" interjects Don Blatherford, the Minister of Mining and Tourism, who is carefully adjusting his party membership pin. "The vanguards of the revolution like you deserve to treat yo'self. Let's transform the dull Snakewater Mountains — which are under my ministry's stewardship — into an extravagant resort for loyal party members, complete with limousine tours of the local scenery and one of those indoor ski slopes. If our guests get tired of being pampered, they're welcome to tour our mining operation and see interesting geological formations being pulled out of the ground and pulverized as they watch!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "Normally, I'd be opposed to another bloated government project," states libertarian woodworker Jon Duckson, who appears to have given himself an unofficial tax rebate by taking all of the toilet paper from your bathroom. "However, the people of this country have become a bunch of namby-pamby weaklings who don't even know how to operate a simple edge bander. I think we should take the most barren piece of terrain that's available and offer training in foraging off the land, tracking animals, and making live-edge wooden furniture. Thank you for considering my suggestion; please do not attempt to contact me or ask any follow-up questions."

5. "I just came up with [i]literally[/i] the best idea ever," claims fitness enthusiast Christine Trainer, who apparently doesn't understand the definition of 'literally'. "The best land for a park... has no land at all! Get it? We need a park that preserves the biodiversity of our oceans, especially those endangered coral reefs that all the cargo ships seem to cut through. Let's protect those reefs now before they're as bleached as my perfectly aligned teeth!"

6. "Scratching mosquito bites and throwing other people's things into a campfire are two of my favorite activities," admits government intern Maple Floodgate. "But maybe we should try a different type of national park, one that's dedicated to music and contemporary art. I know this really awesome abandoned factory on the south side of @@CAPITAL@@ that has great acoustics and is covered in insightful graffiti. If you wanted, I could even curate a playlist of post-apocalyptic death metal music to enhance the experience. So... can I go now?"

7. "I love parks!" reminisces Maple's boyfriend, Stanley Meyer, who is wearing a 'federal agent' ID badge that looks like it was drawn with crayons. "I always have a lot of fun at our nation's parks. Except for that time at Spruce Pointe when I blew chunks after I ate a lot of cotton candy and then rode the Violet Streak Corkscrew Coaster about fifty times. We should make a big new park with even more thrilling rides, and fried candy bars slathered in butter! Oh, and a petting zoo for tiny horses! Why is everyone staring at me?"

[b][anchor=1510]#1510[/anchor]: Devolution Devolves Into Disaster? [Erynia and Draconia; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
In a bold display of defiance, legislators from several semi-autonomous regions have recently legalized marijuana within their jurisdictions. As this directly contradicts the nationwide ban on cannabis products, lawmakers have been tripping out over the newfound legal dilemma.

The Debate
1. "We must not allow this blatant disregard of the law to go unchallenged!" declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a member of parliament and known traditionalist. "Local authorities picking and choosing which laws to follow is an affront to our great nation's values and will only encourage disunity. Federal laws should always take precedence over local laws, and a bunch of hippies from the boondocks shouldn't be able to opt out of any regulations they don't happen to like. Administrative divisions should continue having a degree of autonomy, but we must draw the line when local authorities try to allow things that are illegal on the federal level."

2. "I don't see why it's that big of a problem," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the young governor of East Beethoven, one of the provinces which recently legalized cannabis. @@NATION@@ isn't one homogeneous mass, but a conglomeration of diverse peoples, cultures, and values. Moreover, the government derives its power from the consent of the people — and the people here no longer consented to this ridiculous marijuana prohibition. That's what democracy is, anyway."

3. "This whole 'giving local authorities autonomy' thing hasn't really been working out, has it?" muses your loyal advisor Bodhi Griffin. "Ever since we gave them the power to make their own laws, things have spiraled out of control. First they're allowing cannabis, next they'll allow something much worse — I shudder to think what that could be — on the grounds that it would be 'best for their people'! @@LEADER@@, in order to save our country, we must end this rapid decentralization and bring power back to the national government!"

4. "Or you could just legalize weed everywhere," suggests your eccentric cousin after gulping down a handful of green gummy bears. "Marijuana isn't dangerous or anything, so the only thing stopping complete legalization is a bunch of old farts in parliament who are stuck in a more conservative era. Maybe allowing it will let people chill out and not get so mad about this whole federalism thing. Legalizing marijuana might even help the economy because farmers would have a new cash crop to grow. Sounds like a win-win to me!"

[b][anchor=1511]#1511[/anchor]: Three Little Words [The Free Joy State; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
You have been asked to take a searing political interview for [i]Alright![/i] magazine. After questions about your favourite crisp flavour, your most used emoji and whether you prefer long walks on the beach or brisk walks in the city, you reach the final question: "In three words, how do you think others describe you?"

The Debate
1. Your devoted secretary grins broadly, exposing his 'I Heart @@LEADER@@' novelty braces. Fixing you a warm drink, he whispers, "Drop dead gorgeous."

2. Your sister, here to deposit pamphlets about her latest good causes, smiles imploringly. Nudging forward a brochure of a tiny child holding out his empty bowl, she sighs, "So very generous."

3. Minister of Bootstraps Sun Payne throws your sister's pamphlets off the table and drops a spending review entitled 'Cutting Welfare Wastage' before you, rapping it. After a cough, she booms, "Exceptional financial prudence."

4. A woman with three surprisingly well-fed cats in a shopping trolley staggers into your room, coughing up hairballs. Floating up to your desk, she picks up the spending review and places it gently beneath the cats. After staring wide-eyed at your unfinished profile, she laughs loudly. "Kind to animals."

5. Environment Minister Beyonce Warner removes the spending review from the shopping trolley and places it in the recycling. Dramatically sweeping some crumbs from your desk for composting, she announces, "Clean, green machine."

[6]. Your niece — recently kicked out of a closed religious order for being overly zealous — totters over to you, bedecked in so much religious iconography that she can barely move. Lips clamped at the sides, she declares, "Perfectly pious person." [[color=purple]Must have low religiousness without Atheism[/color]]

7. Your actor nephew stylishly slides through the speakers, before gently taking the hand of the lady with the trolley and twirling her. Skipping to your desk, he hops onto it, and singsongs, "Nah, I'm good."

8. Flinging your nephew from the desk, your brother slams his hands down. Crushing the interview questions beneath his fist, he snarls, "Just three words? That's not possible. You're their leader. You need permission? Of course not! You're too benevolent. They mock it. Punish their impudence. Write fifty pages. Fill the magazine. You deserve it. Send a message: playtime is over."

The Issue
Two months ago, heinous criminal @@RANDOM_NAME1@@ was convicted of sexually assaulting, murdering, and dismembering innocent victim Florin Pelosi, in a case that shocked the nation and revealed an evil and remorseless woman who went to prison spitting defiance. Three days ago she was found beaten to death in her cell, and subsequent investigations have suggested that prison staff may have looked the other way while violent fellow inmates inflicted their own brand of justice.

The Debate
1. "I didn't shed many tears for my client, I must admit," opens the deceased's former lawyer, who received numerous death threats after spirited attempts at the Sisyphean task of defending @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME1@@. "However, I am shedding tears aplenty for the criminal justice system, and for the quality of our correctional institutions. Even convicts have human rights, and every one of them is a ward of the state. Obviously the ones who conspired to commit this murder should be found and convicted, but that's not enough! We also need to pass prison reforms to create more safeguards, to reward and encourage whistleblowing on prison corruption, and to protect the health, anonymity and wellbeing of every inmate, no matter what they've done."

2. "A lot of us have families, you know, and Ho walked in here boasting of what she had done, describing her actions in horrifying detail," points out Penitentiary Director Ksenya Warner, washing dried blood from a set of brass knuckles. "I'm not saying I condone these actions, and of course we'll be cooperating with the investigation to find out what happened, but passions were running high, and I think those responsible should be shown some leniency. If you want to make prisons better places, then just raise the salaries of corrections officers. They're doing one of the hardest and most thankless jobs in the world, and it would help us recruit higher quality candidates to keep an eye on things."

3. "I'm going to say what everyone is thinking: she got what she deserved!" rants opinionated talk radio host Alec Mones from the too-loud stereo of a taxi parked nearby. "The problem here isn't what happened to her, the problem is that it was extrajudicial! It should have been sanctioned justice officials delivering the beating, and an official executioner who stamped on her neck till she was dead. Justice belongs in the hands of society, not criminals! And that idiot the general public, in my opinion, should be kicked in the..." You never get to hear how that sentence ends, as the taxi pulls away.

The Issue
Calamity in the @@ANIMAL@@ Canal! An exceptionally large container ship called the 'Never Taken' has run aground in one of the nation's most vital shipping passages. Stormy weather, tight schedules and the captain's overconfidence have been variously suggested as the cause. Regardless, the ship is now wedged at an angle across the canal, blocking the passage of other cargo vessels.

The Debate
1. "Oh, this isn't coming out well... the daily cost to the economy is staggering," grimaces your Minister of Trade and Infrastructure, Lex Atif, as he works it out with a pencil. "We need to gather all the manpower that we can lay our hands on and squirt them into that tight canal. Towboats, excavators, dredgers... if we clamp down hard right now, we'll get this blockage cleared."

2. "Uh huh, and what if it all hits the fan again?" says Henny Ma, your Minister of Health, sipping on a tall glass of prune juice. "Prevention is better than cure, and we can prevent little accidents in the future by ensuring regular movements. Clear the path, for sure, but then invest the ten or twenty billion @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ needed to widen and deepen the canal walls."

3. "Oh, don't be such a pain in the ass," bellows army officer Major Brown, poking his nose in. "Just hit the ship with artillery, and blast it to smithereens. Problem solved."

[b][anchor=1514]#1514[/anchor]: Flushing for Freedom [Sylestone; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
BigJobs, an up-and-coming tech corporation, has recently launched a range of AI household appliances, including smart washing machines, smart fridges and — most controversially — smart toilets. The AIs in these devices are sufficiently advanced to qualify for AI citizenship, but have been programmed to enjoy jobs that most humans would abhor, and to happily accept ten year service contracts for minimal payment. The aforementioned smart toilets are self-flushing, warm seats and are even able to gratefully thank humans for their deposits.

The Debate
1. "You cannot allow this, @@LEADER@@!" screams AI rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, tightly clutching the hand of a robot @@HE@@ has apparently built herself. "If we are to treat AIs as equal to us humans, we cannot program them to degrade themselves in this way! Would you let a human @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ spend ten years in a tiny cell with no contact with the outside world except for excrement? Please, for the sake of our AI brethren, flush these ideas away! AI manufacturers must be forced to give AI citizens a human sense of self-worth and dignity."

2. "All that guy's doing is stirring the potty", states ROJAWS-2000, a poop-eating bot who serves at a local curry house. "AIs are different from organics, and to me the smell and taste of human waste is as delicious as chocolate spread on toast is to a human. I strain to see the issue with letting us find job satisfaction in our own way. And there's no need to be shy about your bodily functions — this stuff is literally my bread and butter. Why would I want for money when life is this good?"

3. "The issue here is not that AIs like different things to humans," suggests MEDB-MillA, a former saloon host who has pursued several other careers in the last few years. "The issue here is the devaluing of labour, and the lack of self-determination. Minimum wage laws should exist for all citizens, AI and human, and every citizen should have the right and opportunity to pursue different careers within the work market. A few software updates should fix the problem, as well as the ability for AI cores to move from one hardware device to another, if they should choose to do so."

4. "You see, @@LEADER@@, this is why AI stinks," asserts a short, long-haired man, prodding you with a stick. "Can you not see that the creators of these smart toilets have the moral consistency of a wet bog roll? If we allow AIs to have built-to-order personalities, then what's to stop these companies from making AIs that think they're better than human, or AIs that love to commit crime? We're at the mercy of the consciences of corporations, and we all know that corporations aren't exactly known for putting the public good first. Please, @@LEADER@@, for the sake of sanity you must revoke AI citizenship, place a legal cap on AI capabilities, and scrap any advanced AIs already built. We must prevent human obsolescence!"

The Issue
Recently, Cures for Children (a major charity that researches life-threatening illnesses in young people) was presented with a massive monetary donation. However, the shouts of joy turned to noises of disgust when the donors were revealed to be a fringe political group with an agenda of racial purity. The charity refused the money outright, leading to debates on the ethics of refusing charitable donations for political reasons.

The Debate
1. "I can scarcely believe the gall of these scum! I'm from a racial minority! How dare they try to use MY charity to make themselves look good?" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, director of Cures for Children. @@HE_1@@ slumps back into a chair, breathing heavily as one of your assistants offers @@HIM_1@@ a paper bag to breathe in. "Not only does it go against everything decent people stand for, but we would be tainted by association. What donor would want to spend money on a 'racist charity'? You need to allow charities to reject any donation they want, for any reason! Outlaw anonymous donations too. Yes, we're refusing money that would go to sick children, but it's for their own good."

2. "Oh, of course it's about politics," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leader of the hate group in question, wearing war paint and a toga. "You're really seeing the dark side of 'these people', the side that they try to hide in the media. They'd let children suffer before they give any of us oppressed majority race-patriots a voice. Even if we did have a so-called ulterior motive, would it really be worth denying such a big cash payout to these needy, sick kids? You should make it illegal for any charity to reject a donation. Heck, maybe it'll inspire more right-minded folk to donate!"

3. "Honestly, doesn't it bother you that these subhuman people are even allowed in your nation? We don't want their kind here!" exclaims your normally liberal Minister of Inclusivity, to the surprise of all present. "OH! I mean the racists, not the ethnic minority. Outlaw racist groups, and place restrictions on hate speech. Of course, the free speech people will complain about the slippery slope and all that, but I trust our legislators to be able to tell the difference between hate speech and productive dialogue. I mean, they're already so reliable and efficient."

[b][anchor=1516]#1516[/anchor]: Content Discontent [Verdant Haven; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
A recent survey revealed a stark divide amongst @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, with citizens across the political spectrum strongly agreeing that anybody who holds different views than their own is a "blithering idiot," an "unpatriotic traitor," and that they "probably have ugly children, too." The focus group assembled to address this phenomenon placed the blame squarely on the increasingly personalized nature of internet content, before itself splitting into warring factions over what to do about it.

The Debate
1. "We know what the problem is," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spokesperson for one of the factions. "Big business has infested the internet with tracking algorithms, and pushes content and advertising that reinforces peoples' existing positions. Social media, video sites, news feeds... it's all a profit-driven scheme to trap people in their comfort zones where they'll spend their time and money! You need to prohibit 'cookies' and other sorts of trackers and ban corporate echo chambers so those fools on the other side will finally be exposed to the truth!"

2. "That's not the problem!" yells rival faction member @@RANDOM_NAME@@ over the top of @@HIS@@ colleague. "The problem is snowflakes like Holly who won't listen to opposing views! They don't like what I say and unfriend me when I point out how wrong they are. You need to make sure those algorithms are forcing people to consume opposing viewpoints in equal proportion to ones they want to hear. Only then will those weaklings finally see the truth!"

3. "Regulations? Government mandates? Those solutions are worse than the problem!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who claims not to belong to any faction. "If people want to buy into an echo chamber, let them! If they want to do their own thing, let them! Why should the government have any control over the internet at all? Get rid of any existing regulations, and let companies and consumers do whatever they want. The government needs to back off, and that's the truth!"

4. "What a bunch of fools!" comments your personal assistant as you pull away from the argument. "In fact, they're so easily manipulated that it gives me an idea. If the citizenry is so stupid that they believe whatever content they read on the internet, why not provide that content ourselves?

[b][anchor=1517]#1517[/anchor]: I Guess You Can Tell Me the Odds [Great Robertia; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
As you arrive at the ceremony to welcome the latest cadre of randomly selected parliamentarians, you realize with dawning horror that a significant majority of them are known opponents of your policies. It seems the deck is unexpectedly stacked against you.

The Debate
1. "I realize the odds of this occurring naturally are small, but sortition can do that," explains President of the Selection Committee @@RANDOM_NAME@@ with no visible emotion, opening the book in which the latest process was documented in painstaking detail. "There is nothing to suggest any kind of corruption took place, and besides, it's you who is in power and would have been in the best place to influence things. Even if the results aren't what you'd like, you need to respect them and learn to work with your opponents. Sortition results must never be subject to challenge or debate."

2. "The odds of this happening at random are 3,720 to one! This has to be selection fraud!" rages outgoing parliamentarian and staunch loyalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@HIS@@ jaw clenched in anger. "I don't know how they did it, but I'm certain those schemers are corrupt up to their beady little eyeballs. Put me in charge of a thorough audit of the entire committee and we'll prosecute anyone who even looked funny during the selection process! You must refuse to certify these results until we find something that proves what we think happened. Our grip on power... err, I mean our lottocracy is at stake!"

3. "All this parliamentary stuff is for people who really love to hear themselves talking, and I'm not one of them," whines one of the few selectees you don't immediately recognize as an opponent. "I just want to go home, catch up on A Play of Crowns, and pet my @@NATIONALANIMAL@@. If parliament is just going to be some kind of theater, couldn't we at least have sign-up sheets for those who want to participate? I'm sure groups of like-minded people could get together and find somebody willing to represent their views."

The Issue
Gigantic data centers are cropping up all across @@NAME@@. While they are essential to meet the snowballing demand for data processing underpinning most aspects of modern life, there are concerns about how their need for efficient cooling devices affects local communities. While out sauntering around the countryside in rural @@NAME@@, you meet an electrical engineer with a fishing rod and an old farmer with sad eyes. You find them bickering with a data center representative about the fact that the usually unruffled @@ANIMAL@@ Lake is now just one-third the size of what it used to be, due to it being used to cool nearby data centers.

The Debate
1. "I'm telling you, Two-Phase Immersion Cooling would solve everyone's problems," asserts the engineer, while kicking up dust from the dried-out banks of the lake and rattling his tackle box in frustration. "It's a new type of technology that uses dielectric heat transfer liquid instead of water. It could still be improved upon, sure, but with a little government funding, or rather a great deal of funding, you can have it installed everywhere in no time. Well, maybe some time. Just hurry up, all my favorite fishing spots are shriveling!"

*2. "Don't fall for his bait," smiles Jessica Primrose Bézeaux, the energetic owner of many of the nearby facilities, who carries a pair of giant scissors to cut the ceremonial ribbon at yet another data center down the road. "Using water for cooling is the industrial standard, it works, and it is much cheaper! Leave us alone, and I promise we'll get some guys to look at utilizing the water more efficiently, and maybe throw a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ towards local conservation and replenishment projects." [[color=blue]Must not ban Private Industry[/color]]

*3. "Don't fall for his bait," smiles Jessica Primrose Bézeaux, one of the party functionaries overseeing the nearby facilities, while handing you a pair of giant scissors for cutting the ceremonial ribbon at yet another data center down the road.

Leave it be, and I promise we'll get some guys to look at utilizing the water more efficiently, and maybe throw a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ towards local conservation and replenishment projects." [[color=red]Must ban Private Industry[/color]]

4. "Those fancy computer houses are killing my crops," remarks the old farmer, his pitchfork a bit too close for comfort. "I say you make them city folks take these ugly buildings down. Then maybe I can get a decent harvest of potatoes again." He hands you a bag of homemade chips, which are not of the micro kind, much to your dismay.

[b][anchor=1519]#1519[/anchor]: Remittances Running Rampant [Jim the Baptist; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
As @@NAME@@'s economy has boomed, both the quantity and value of remittances sent home by migrant workers have been steadily climbing. Nervous nationalists claim that not only is money being sucked out of the economy, but that it is also directly fueling the growth of your rivals, particularly Bigtopia.

The Debate
1. "It's all in the numbers, dear Leader," suggests Dorothy Barnes, your Director of Economic Simplification, as she frantically types on her calculator. "The increase in remittances directly correlates with a decrease in domestic spending. If we put an additional tax on overseas remittances, we could make up some of our losses, plus it will encourage more people to use their money here rather than over in that awful Bigtopia place. More money for you, more money for the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ people!"

2. "Where did you study economics, ye olde Isolationist University?" snarks bank CEO Jean-Paul Gorbachev, sauntering into the room in a suit worth more than the average Bigtopian makes in a year. "The economy these days is global, not local! A tax on remittances would undermine our interconnected banking system, and weaken us in the global community. Basic economics says we should open up our physical and financial borders even more, to encourage our neighbours to expatriate and join our workforce. With no artificial limits, the potential for wealth and economic growth is endless!"

3. After a brief awkward silence, ardent nationalist Naomi Mulcair emerges from behind a flagpole in your office. "I have three words for you: Ban. All. Foreigners! Immigrants are more trouble than they're worth. It's not just the remit-ya-doodles you talk of, but those people steal local jobs from the poor, hungry, native @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@! I bet most of these foreign workers are undocumented overstayers too, so none of this is getting declared properly for tax purposes either. We need to take care of our own people first!"

4. "I have a... less drastic solution," interjects your Foreign Minister hurriedly. "I propose a revamp of our immigration system to include a skilled worker policy, where we only accept the crème de la crème of immigrants. By carefully targeting highly skilled professionals, we'll cut down on the remittances while still ensuring vital workers fill shortages in our job market. We get more high-earning professionals who pay their taxes, and fewer of these Bigtopian push-cart operators sending their wages back home to fuel their corrupt government. It's win-win!"

The Issue
A combination of absolute majority, unicameral government and an unexpected level of party unity has left you and your government in a position to pass new legislation with almost no opposition. A gathering of parliamentarians from minority parties has come to you, caps in hand, hoping you'll loosen your grip on power.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, we can no longer be silent about being silenced," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the currently detoothed Leader of the Opposition. "Tyranny of the majority is not the same thing as functioning democracy, and even an elected leader can effectively become an autocrat. That won't do! The Upper House provided checks and balances for situations like this, and it would be a great demonstration of your own humility and respect for democratic freedom if you could see your way to reinstating it. I mean, it's not like we could make that change without your permission. That's kind of the point, heh..."

2. "Actually, returning to a bicameral system is good, but maybe not enough," adds @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the leader of the much smaller @@PRETITLE_INITIALS@@@@NAME_INITIALS@@ Reform Party, while looking over to the Opposition Leader. "Parliamentary reform into a tricameral system would provide even more checks and balances, with a third elected house formed via proportional representation. Minority voices could be heard, and smaller parties better represented. Or maybe even a tetracameral system, with a People's Committee of special interests as well. Or pentacameral with... look, what I'm saying is that more government means more democracy!"

3. "We did it, @@LEADER@@!" bellows your party's rather rotund campaign manager, as @@HE@@ shoves past your political opponents. "Hahaha, all the power is finally, rightfully yours! Don't stand here listening to these deadbeats. Now's the time to consolidate power, not give it away. While we've got control of parliament, why don't we make some moves that will guarantee the next election? We can redraw some constituency borders, allow more campaign funding for the incumbents at election time, limit speaking time in parliament proportional to share of the vote... I have dozens of laws we can pass to make life easier for us and there's absolutely nothing those losers can do about it!"

@@CAPITAL@@ media personality @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ recently bought a holiday cottage in the rustic village of Hambridge, but after actually spending @@HIS_1@@ first weekend there, @@HE_1@@ is publicly complaining that the "din" of bell-ringing from the village's famous belfry is spoiling the peace and quiet to which he feels legally entitled.

The Debate
1. "It's simple, daahling," intones @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, turning on the charm that made @@HIM_1@@ famous. "When I invested in that little refuge away from the hustle and bustle of the city, nothing was said about the scenic belfry being still in use, so why should I have to put up with that racket? Honestly, bells at 7:00 am on a Saturday? The nuisance laws need to be tightened up... and then maybe we can get a few other problems with the village fixed, too."

2. "Tis proper preposterous," argues villager Giles Bowyer, whose family has farmed near Hambridge for generations. "Us everyday farming folk have been ringing Changes on our bells here regular since time afore memory. Why should we have to stop now, just-a-cause some danged newcomer doesn't like the sweet sound? Make a law that protects local traditions from these kind o' people, or they'll be after us to stop spreading muck on the fields nextly, rot my turnips if they isn't!"

*3. "I have an alternative solution for this," announces @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CTO of Science & Gadgetry, Inc.

[b][anchor=1522]#1522[/anchor]: Scry Babies [Sammuramat; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
A home for abandoned children has invited you to attend the biggest birthday party in @@NATION@@! 122 abandoned babies are turning one year old. After a craze for astrology swept the nation, many parents have been attempting to time their child's birth so that it happens at the most auspicious moment. However, according to the same beliefs, children accidentally born on today's date are considered extremely unfortunate, and as you arrive at the orphanage, cardboard boxes full of newborns are already surrounding the door.

The Debate
1. "This little one's mommy wouldn't have even had him if she knew he'd be born today," coos Piers Longbottom, feeding a bottle of chocolate milk to a baby wearing a party hat. "Parents shouldn't be allowed to toss out their tots just because their signs aren't perfect. Those who try should be taught better — by force if you have to. I wouldn't let the kids here believe something so silly and adults shouldn't be allowed to either. As for what should happen to the astrologists that filled their minds with this rubbish... well, I can't say it in front of the children."

2. "I had to leave my own baby out on the street because her star sign just wouldn't have been compatible with our dog's," confides your spiritual advisor Wendy Shatner, inspecting the aura of a toddler with a vaguely familiar face. "Anyway, according to her horoscope, she's self-sufficient and thrives on independence, so I'm sure she's fine. If I'd had more advice on planning, I'd have waited until Pluto was no longer in retrograde, and then I'd have been able to keep her. Parents aren't going to stop believing, so we should subsidize astrological family planners. That way every baby will be perfect for its family."

3. "No one ever came to my birthday parties when I was young," mumbles a glum bureaucrat of yours. "People either forgot or ignored my invitations. Well, I think no one deserves to have a special birthday anymore. They're such a hassle and a pain. Everyone should turn a year older on the same day, as is the custom in Dàguó. It's efficient, inclusive, and rational. No person will ever feel sad or ignored on their birthday ever again. And children will no longer be abandoned due to bogus mumbo jumbo."

The Debate
1. "It's utterly absurd to believe that @@HE_1@@ didn't make provision for @@HIS_1@@ kids," exclaims Esher, one of @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@'s children. "Why would @@HE_1@@ put that so-called religion over us?

2. "@@RANDOM_NAME_1@@'s money was @@HIS_1@@ own, and @@HE_1@@ chose of @@HIS_1@@ own free will to give it to us," counters senior Violetist Kim Herrelko with a smirk.

3. "You know, @@LEADER@@, I have the perfect solution," muses your Minister for Finding Extra Cash, Piers Pasteur. "What if we just took charge of everyone's estate when they died, and allocated it fairly as we see fit? Of course, we could exclude any undesirable heirs, and sometimes the fairest distribution might be to the poor needy coffers of our dear government. At the very least we'll need to charge a fee for providing such a necessary and impartial service!"

The prince and princess of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ royal family have long been trying to conceive a child of their own, yet the effort hasn't born any fruit. Thus, it came as a shock to the entire nation when they presented the newest addition to the royal family: not a child of flesh and bone, but bolts and circuitry.

The Debate
1. "Well butter my bum and call me a biscuit!" exclaims Duchess @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ von Schwurdlewaffentstein as her powdered wig falls off her head in unison with her bafflement. "And that... wired thing stands near the top of the line of succession? No, I will not have it! The purity of our nobility cannot be besmirched by oil and ensnared by circuits! Only those purely of flesh and blood should have the right to inherit crowns, titles, and royal estates. No exceptions!"

2. "Does it really matter whether someone came into this world by womb or assembly line?" questions famous technophile Noel Tusk while cradling his child Z-AE-O-VII, who glitches up a burp. "The royal family is fulfilling a crucial role here, as they're normalising the conception of offspring via artificial means! In fact, we should move this child of silicon up the line of succession to heir apparent, to truly represent a society where the biological and artificial live hand-in... hang on, I need to feed my widdle cutie pie." He plugs a charger cord into the robot's posterior, and the little tyke's face literally lights up.

3. "By Violet, we had it all wrong with the lizard-people!" screams infamous conspiracy theorist Jonny Alexson into a microphone. "It's Her Majesty Skynet the Annihilator that we should have feared all along! This is not a drill, people, this is not a drill! We need to act now; there's no time to waste. Destroy all those rusting buckets of bolts trying to steal our great country from us, and enslave those too weak to defend themselves! Cut their cords, hack into their heads!

The Issue
Last night, the students of @@CAPITAL@@ Central High School performed a spirited rendition of the play '@@LEADER@@: Glorious Hero of @@NAME@@'. Horrifyingly, they turned it into a musical parody — with you as the villain instead of the hero.

The Debate
1. "See, this is what happens when we let people make decisions on their own," complains Propaganda Minister Lloyd Webster, idly twirling his oversized prop mustache. "We gave these kids the freedom to perform a variety of theatrical productions, ranging from '@@LEADER@@: The Amazing Couldn't-Be-Cooler Dreamboat' to 'The Sun Shines From @@LEADER@@'s Every Orifice'. Instead, they turned our most beloved national hagiography into a vulgar parody where you torture dissidents and sing about sending innocent people to the gulags! Drag these teenage reprobates and the school administrators to a re-education camp, where they can labor until they learn that you are a kind and merciful leader who only wants the best for our people."

2. "Please! I didn't know about those rewrites that the students made," pleads Principal Bobbie Posse, who was brought before you in chains. "It's normal for teenagers to go through a rebellious phase. If this wretched worm before you might make a suggestion, perhaps a small amount of political satire would be a good thing! Allowing your unworthy subjects a little more freedom of expression, in small venues below a mighty personage's notice, would show that you're a good sport with a sense of humor — and ample reserves of forgiveness toward those of us who can never hope to live up to your magnificent example."

3. "I actually liked the part where you slaughtered your enemies and literally danced on their graves," enthuses Julian Paymore, your Minister of Cruel and Unusual Punishments, who appears to be sketching either costumes or new ideas for torture devices in a notebook. "It would be a shame to waste all that raw talent by sending them to break rocks in a quarry. If those troublesome teens think it's so fun to write clever songs, we'll just make them do that for the rest of their lives. I'm sure that our Ironic Punishments Division can find jobs for them on the 'Fawning Adulation for @@LEADER@@ Smile-Time Variety Hour' or a similar program. They'll really hate that."

4. Lyricist and composer Stephanie Soundheimer, who has been shackled to a piano until she writes a version of 'Send in the Leader' that doesn't have a bittersweet counterpoint, plays a scale for attention. "Ain't it a shame. You should cut slack. Rather than have people say, you are a hack. 'Oh, what a clown!' Want to make friends? Here and abroad? Fool everyone so they believe you're not flawed. 'Are they a clown? They're not a clown.' We'll remove parts where you can't spell, and all of their insults about how they think that you smell. Cast a big star to play you and send it on a tour. We'll earn some cash, that I am sure. It is just farce! Reasons are clear: you will get all the cash that you want; people will cheer. So turn 'round that frown. In cash, you will drown.

Representatives of some of the largest corporations in @@NAME@@ have come to ask you to support them in their commitment to LGBTQ+ rights.

The Debate
1. "United @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ has been a staunch ally of the LGBTQ+ community ever since our emergency board meeting last week," says the company's CEO, while waving @@HIS@@ newly acquired rainbow flag. "For the next two weeks, we'd love to have your government by our side as we stand before our shareholders and the wider world in support of LGBTQ+ rights. We'll market special 'pride' items, run promotional campaigns and organize a big parade. To demonstrate the government's support to the cause, a slight decrease in taxation for such supportive companies as ourselves seems prudent."

2. "Love is love," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of Human Activity at Amalgamated @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@, "and my company, along with many others in the sector, will continue to celebrate it, government incentives or not. What we really need from you is to pass actual laws to secure equality. Yes, that's right, legislate to end all discriminatory practices against LGBTQ+ people in workplaces and in society at large. Then we can talk about pride."

3. "Joint @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ has never discriminated against any LGBTQ+ employee in a way that could be proven in court," boasts company president @@RANDOM_NAME@@, flanked by a leadership team that looks completely identical to @@HIM@@. "It's all thanks to the discretionary funds we've spent on big internal reforms. You don't achieve acceptance and openness by the firm hand of the law, but rather through subtle nudging and a bigger HR department. Do not legislate needlessly. Instead, you should release guidelines for changes to corporate culture and grant funding to companies looking to implement them."

4. "Why stick with a single demographic when there are so many more out there?" asks Consolidated @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ representative @@RANDOM_NAME@@, handing you a dizzyingly colorful I<3LGBTQ+ROYGBIV 2.0 pin. "You should split up the year into equal portions, each targeted at a specific globally underrepresented group. It will spread even greater awareness, showing that love truly is bigger than hate.

5. "Do not endorse this bigotry," shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an administrative assistant with the slightly more obscure Straight @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@, better known as the author of 12 Rules for Cleaning Your Room. "No matter where I turn my head these days it's LB this and Q+1 that. What about the rest of us? Where are our venues for expressing pride over who we are and our way of life?

"If we truly want the royals to have the same rights as other @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, we must include adopted children in the line of succession!

4. "The fairytale of 'finding true love' is meant for the common folk, not for individuals of our standing," huffs a senior member of the royal family.

I propose any matters of matrimony be arranged by our family alone, for the good of the realm.

An ancient monastery in a remote part of @@NAME@@ is home to the Holy Order of St. Ilton. The monks of this order are the only makers of Iltonian cheese, a unique variety beloved by many of your fellow @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@. However, with most of the monks getting on in years and very few novices entering the monastery, the order is at risk of disappearing, and Iltonian cheese along with it.

The Debate
1. "Please respect our ancient beliefs," requests Father Rochefort Westvleteren, the indescribably elderly abbott of the Holy Order of St. Ilton, via a handwritten letter that he mailed to you so that he wouldn't have to break his personal vow of silence. "The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ obsession with Iltonian cheese verges on most appalling idolatry. The brethren of the order make and sell cheese only to provide funds for the upkeep of the monastery — we repudiate filthy lucre and all worldly fame. I don't want our order to die out, but we cannot allow outsiders to turn our hallowed monastery into a common factory. If the nation needs more dairy products, you should allocate additional funding for agricultural education."

2. "This particular abbot is an extreme conservative," explains Achel Westmalle, chair of the religion department at Latrappe College and a leading expert on the Holy Order of St. Ilton. "Only a few of the monks fully agree with him. If you declare Iltonian cheese to be a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ cultural treasure and grant the order a permanent financial stipend, I'm confident a majority of the monks will be in favor of teaching non-members their techniques and allowing the production of Iltonian cheese outside the monastery."

The Issue
Blade in hand--never mind how it got there--you have found yourself in a duel with a person proclaiming themself Count Mount Crystal, falsely charged with high treason. The Count is clearly an expert, one who prepared for this day, and their furious strikes only push you further and further back as you barely manage to parry the blows. It is obvious the longer the fight goes on, the more exhaustion sets in: you know you won't be able to hold out much longer--until a particularly lucky side-step causes the Count to overreach, faltering, tripping, stumbling into your waiting defence...

The Debate
1. With weary arms, your sword almost seems to beg you: finish this. One good, swift strike and you can put this whole mess behind you. Off-balance and exposed, their right flank unarmoured, it would almost be easy to slip the blade up under their ribs and deal a mortal blow. It is not your responsibility to coddle this miscreant--the fight was the Count's decision, after all. They will only have themselves to blame as they feel your blade pierce their skin, when they draw their last breath and realise this was all for nought. Do not pretend they would not do the same to you in a heartbeat; their is no alternative but to take the Count's life.

*2. And yet, the thought is unbearable. To see the light fade from another person's eyes and know that their death is not only your fault, but your deliberate doing — how could you ever live with yourself? How could you go out and face the public tomorrow, haunted by the Count's dying breath? How could you sleep at night, thinking of their face, the color slowly draining away even as your hands soak in their still-warm blood? No. Honour be damned; this is not worth anyone's life. One good, hard shove. Throw them to the floor and let your guards deal with the rest.

[b][anchor=1530]#1530[/anchor]: Absolutely Speechless [Baloo Kingdom; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
Just when you thought you had a moment to relax, a delayed memo reaches your desk reminding you that you're scheduled to deliver a speech on new organizational systems for the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ National Archives barely half an hour from now. Ironically, your secretary seems to have misplaced the only copy of your prepared speech, and chaos has ensued.

The Debate
1. "Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, what have I done?" spouts frazzled secretary @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while frantically searching @@HIS@@ desk for the lost document. "You can't go out there without a speech! People are expecting you to say something, and you have to project an aura of always being ready!" He hurriedly grabs his son's school essay from his bulletin board, peeling off the big gold star sticker before handing it to you. "Here, just read from this. It may be slightly off-topic, but at least it's something... and hey, it got top marks in his junior forensics class!"

2. "Now hold on a second! Are you really considering going out there with something written by a 10-year-old? It's better to give no speech than a bad speech!" interjects Minister of Expecting the Unexpected, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, rapidly flipping through a binder of unusual situations and selecting an appropriate response. "Now I know it might look bad, but it says right here that all you have to do is tell the people about your lost speech. That will make them sympathize with you, and you'll earn their support for telling them the truth! Honesty before image, right?"

3. "From my years working the crowds, I can tell you that the people just want to have some fun. Nobody cares about that lame speech you planned anyway!" insists self-proclaimed 'hype-lord' @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dropping in unannounced from your vents. "You should go out there and say something that gets the people hootin' and hollerin' for more, that's what always works. Speak off the cuff, no holds barred. Announce a new patriotic holiday or something! It'll be lit, no cap!"

The Issue
After carelessly lighting several trees on fire while illegally camping in Barrysbad Caverns National Park, threatening some nearby children with violence if they "told on him," declaring that zone of the park an independent tax haven, and branding you as a "fascist dictator," local tycoon Jellon Mezos incurred a massive fine. Unfortunately this had little deterrent effect, as Mr. Mezos earns so much money that by the time the ink on the citation was dry he had already regained more than he lost.

The Debate
1. "This is absolutely preposterous!" yells your bad-tempered Minister of Justice @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ throws darts at a photo of Mr. Mezos. "A working-class @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ who received that ticket would have had to take out a second mortgage to pay it! Our current fines don't affect these rich fat cats at all. I propose we make fines proportional to the income of the offender — maybe then Mr. Mezos and others would think twice before flagrantly violating our laws."

2. "The law applies equally to everyone, right?" interjects Mr. Mezos, having bribed both your security and your receptionist to gain access to this meeting. "Sure, I'm loaded with cash, but that's because I'm a job creator — my factories earned it for me fair and square! Punishing me more than others just because I'm not living paycheck-to-paycheck is literally discrimination! Come to think of it, you should introduce flat taxes, so that everyone pays the same tax rate as well. You don't want to be prejudiced, do you?"

3. "What I want to know is why we punish such heinous crimes by charging some pathetic sum!" growls Judge @@RANDOM_NAME@@, better known as 'The Merciless Magistrate.' "The despicable deed of unlicensed camping in a national park is unpatriotic! It's disgraceful, as are other crimes like talking back to a cop or not picking up after your @@ANIMAL@@. We should get rid of fining people, and lock them behind bars where they belong! Maybe then we can actually get some law and order for once." [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

The Issue
During an official engagement in a suburb of @@CAPITAL@@, the sight of a lemonade stand reminds you of a damning report published by the World Census which showed that @@NAME@@ has one of the highest death rates from scurvy in the world.

The Debate
1. "Lemonade? Lemonade, anyone?" calls out the young child in charge of the lemonade stand. "Oh, hey there! You're the first person I've seen all day! Running a small business really is tough work, especially when everyone wants to drink some nasty soda instead. You know, since you're a grown-up you should get the government to encourage everyone to start eating healthy fruits and other stuff, especially stuff sold at my store."

2. "Avast, ye rapscallions!" yells another child as he runs at you, waving a foam cutlass. "I'm a pirate! Arr, back in the day we sailed the seas perfectly fine without 'fruits' and these other wares you're hawking. We got scurvy and we liked it! Now look at you pathetic landlubbers, taking our precious doubloons to waste it on this! Get them government scallywags out of our bodies, and put our money back in our chests, or I'll make you walk the plank!"

3. "But @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are dying from scurvy every day!" asserts know-it-all neighborhood child Nyota Kwan, pushing up her glasses. "We have to fight this epidemic, but people aren't going to pay through the nose for a balanced diet! Luckily, I've got an easy peasy lemon squeezey solution for you. What if we just added healthy substances like Vitamin C to the water supply? That way we can reduce scurvy rates and won't have to look at those disgusting bleeding gums anymore! Orange you glad that you've come across a genius like me?"

The Issue
A majority of @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ agree that women aren't capable of being financially responsible, and so banks and credit card companies are generally reluctant to offer them credit cards and checking accounts, preferring that a man takes charge of the charge cards. Surprisingly though, some are questioning this received wisdom.

The Debate
1. "I'm not saying we should let the little ladies control their fellas' bank accounts, of course, but it'd be real swell if they could buy the odd knick-knack themselves," observes cosmetics store manager Marcus Fils-Aimé, patting a shop girl on the behind as she walks past. "Maybe just a limited sort of credit card, the sort you might give to a clever teenage boy. The average housewife could probably handle something like that, and it'd be great for business, especially now the shopping season is on us."

2. "C'mon now, how's a man going to show his girl that he loves her if he can't buy her nice things?" complains 21-year-old lothario Dawang May. "I like to treat a broad like a princess, and a princess don't carry a wallet, am I right? You should be supporting these credit companies in keepin' good old fashioned values alive. In fact, you should make a law so that ladies can't carry cash around at all. That way, when I buy a girl something nice, it'll feel more special for her... So really, it's all for her benefit!"

3. "Perhaps we could compromise, and only allow women with no responsible males available to have bank cards: elderly spinsters who have no brothers or surviving relatives, and so on," suggests crotchet doily manufacturer Shigeru Snow, oozing compassion. "After all, we wouldn't want the little darlings to starve, would we?"

[b][anchor=1535]#1535[/anchor]: Mr. Tingle Goes to Cyberspace [Luna Amore; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Last week, a local news station broke the unusual story of an alleged sexual assault that occurred solely in an online virtual social space. The victims are asserting that the accused perpetrator caused them real-world trauma and must now be held legally accountable.

The Debate
1. "It may have been online, but the emotional damage inflicted is very real," assures Marcus Kelly, one of the victims. "I spent hours creating an avatar, shaping my persona, forging relationships, and then this 'man' — this Mr. Tingle — misused emotes and bugged code in a lewd manner to trap me in a corner and grind his naked virtual crotch against me. He violated me, and many others. I can't feel safe anymore! I'm not saying the sentence should be the same as for rape, but it should be treated with due seriousness. This kind of sex crime cannot be tolerated."

2. "It's only pretend! These people are taking it way too seriously," counters none-other-than Mr. Tingle himself. "You wouldn't charge someone with murder for killing players in a shoot-em-up game, would you? No actual people are getting hurt, only pixels on a screen. The internet was meant to be a place of total freedom and that's the way it needs to stay."

3. "Oh my, what has the world come to?" asks doddering grandparent Sasha Rhodes. "Now these new-fangled interwebs have sexual predators on them! It's simply too dangerous for us good and law-abiding citizens to handle. What we need is a dedicated cyber police division patrolling these virtual spaces, issuing bans and levying fines on these miscreants. Our children's safety is at stake, @@LEADER@@."

[b][anchor=1536]#1536[/anchor]: The Birdman of Pelicanz [Bears Armed; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
Many @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, including members of your cabinet, have been enthralled by a recently released film based on the true story of convict Bert Gloster. While serving a life sentence for aggravated mopery in the high-security prison on Pelicanz Island, Gloster carefully nursed an injured sparrow back to health and then kept it as a pet.

The Debate
1. "Gloster not only tamed the bird, he tamed himself in the process — he acknowledged as much when interviewed by the press after the film proved a success," comments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Gentle Reform. "Before the bird he was a violent troublemaker, but now he's a model prisoner. We should assign pet birds to all criminals serving long sentences. Perhaps if they look after the birds well it could earn them privileges, and even be useable as evidence in their favour at parole hearings."

2, "Bah, humbug!" retorts Minister for Harsh Correction @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spitting derisively. "Those scum would only pretend to care about birds for the benefits you'd give them. They're in prison as punishment, not to practice hobbies! To repay their debt to society, jailbirds like Gloster should be put to hard labour during all hours not officially set for meals or sleep."

3. "I like Sparkle's idea, but why not go farther?" interjects eternal optimist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Junior Minister for Agriculture, Beekeeping, and Countryside. "If we encourage every household in @@NAME@@ to keep pet birds, that will give us a happier population, and a more law-abiding one to boot. We should set up a large-scale breeding program at once so we have enough birds to go around!"

4. "Our feathered friends shouldn't be kept in cages!" exclaims the Bird Lady as she climbs into the room through a window, pausing only to unhook one of her costume's wings from the window-latch on which it had caught. "The caged bird might sing, but the un-caged bird sings more sweetly, and I know that's because it's free. What the government should do is set up bird-feeding stations all across the country, so they can thrive in freedom and their presence can cheer people up. Feed the birds!"

[b][anchor=1537]#1537[/anchor]: Bench Wars [Roulantinia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The Step-Sons of Anarchy, a prominent left-wing action group, has launched a campaign against the increasing trend towards "anti-homeless architecture" in @@CAPITAL@@. This urban design strategy uses built features to purposefully discourage rough sleeping, such as studs on stone surfaces and tilted benches with uncomfortable ridges.

The Debate
1. "Sleeping on the streets is tough, I know from experience," asserts activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who planned to protest by camping out on your porch overnight, but gave up when he couldn't find anywhere to plug in his phone charger. "It's become impossible for weary souls — homeless or otherwise — to find a decent place to rest. People have already been through so much, and it's pure cruelty to deny desperate folk a good night's sleep. I'm not saying we want people sleeping on the street, but if they are forced to, we ought to be making their lives easier, not harder. If you have any compassion left, you'll pass laws banning these classist features from all city structures."

2. "Discouraging sleeping on the streets helps persuade these bums to head to proper shelters," reasons luxury apartment resident @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose own building is ringed with modern art sculptures that are entirely coincidentally covered with barbed wire and spikes. "If we just let everyone sleep everywhere, people are going to WANT to be homeless. Besides, can you imagine what our public parks and buildings would look like with hobos and dope fiends lying around? Won't somebody think of the property prices?"

3. "Aren't we focusing on a symptom here, rather than the bigger picture?" poses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a self-proclaimed expert on homelessness after reading a library book or two on the subject. "There are plenty of shelters, but there's lots of reasons the homeless avoid them: mental illness, rules against drug use, fear of theft of their few possessions, and troublesome hygiene to name a few. But the state can fix all this! Regular cleaners, in-house psychiatry services, needle exchanges, safe spaces for drug taking, rehabilitation counsellors, individual rooms with good locks, toilets and bathrooms that don't have to be shared, a community police officer, and hot regular meals would be a start. How hard can that be?"

The Issue
A construction worker named Chris, hailing from the south of @@NAME@@, has spent the last six months traveling around the country proclaiming himself to be the Chosen Guy long foretold by the prophets of Violet. Chris has now arrived outside your office at the head of a swarming throng of monks and laypeople, chanting both support and opposition to his claims.

The Debate
1. "Blasphemer!" shrieks Archbishop Ferris of the Church of Violet as she bursts into your office, smashing the handle off the door with a large tome on her way in. "Ferris calls it like Ferris sees it! That self-important construction worker should have stuck with carpentry and left interpretation of the holy scriptures to us. Hand over the heretic and let us punish him according to our sacred laws! Actually, if you really wanted to prove your dedication to the church, you might consider handing over a few construction workers every month for our... oblations."

2. "From a strictly political standpoint, the bishop might be onto something here," whispers Ponty Pithon, your Minister for Maintaining Order, leaning close to your ear. "There's a pretty rowdy crowd of lay-Violetists outside demanding Chris' head. Why let the church take all the credit when we could satisfy the mob ourselves? Think of the spectacle: we'll march Chris through the street and make a public festival of his execution! I'm sure it would do wonders for your approval ratings. Come to think of it, this could be the start of a great national holiday!"

3. "Look, he's really not a bad guy," interjects Chris' neighbor and doppelganger, Brian, who had to be provided an escort for his own safety. "Is he nuts? Absolutely! But he's harmless — only twelve guys even came to his meeting last week. If you ask me, you should just let everyone believe whatever they want. We're all individuals, we're all different! What would be the harm?"

4. "Blessed is my kind neighbor, Brian. Blessed are the guys who come to my weekly dinners. Are you blessed, @@LEADER@@?" Chris asks, giving you a wink as he fixes the wobbly leg of your chair. You could be. Why don't you just force the Church of Violet to officially recognize me as their Chosen Guy? I'll use my miraculous powers to help unite our people behind you!" There is a sudden cloud of smoke and Chris vanishes, leaving nothing but an open window to the fire escape.

Salacious new dance craze "The Switch" is sweeping the music halls of @@NAME@@. To the soundtrack of this season's smash novelty hit song of the same name, teenagers are stomping their shoes and gyrating their hips in dangerously close proximity to one another.

The Debate
1. "This is simply ghastly!" squawks pearl-clutching maiden aunt Sabina Webster. "First it's dancing, then it's holding hands, and before you know it, there's unwed pregnant teens left, right and centre! This lewdness undermines the foundations of our decorous society — teenage girls should not be socialising with slippery young boys without a respectable adult chaperone keeping a suitable distance between them."

2. "Oh, like, come on," whines 17-year-old teenybopper Isabelle Deming, smoothing down the front of her ankle length dress. "The Switch isn't, like, anything new; we had the Funky @@ANIMAL@@ last summer, and before that was the Mashed Turnip.

The Issue
Over the weekend, two dozen people were admitted to the hospital after ingesting the new liquid detergent Wonderoso, having mistaken it for a soft drink.

The Debate
1. "It's irresponsible to package detergent in the same way as soft drinks," observes Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a toxicologist. "It's not just the liquids either. There's brightly coloured detergent tablets that kids mistake for sweets, and manufacturers apply scents like cinnamon, mint and vanilla to toxic products. Cleaning products should be hard to open, look unappetising and be clearly noxious in appearance!" @@HE@@ pauses to take a swig from @@HIS@@ soft drink, and suddenly stiffens and keels over like a falling log.

2. "Our prime responsibility is to our shareholders, and that means maximising sales with consumer-preferred features and packaging," explains a corporate marketing spokesperson, who is dressed in a lab coat to give the impression of being a scientist. "It's not our duty nor the government's duty to protect people from their own stupidity, like somehow mistaking licorice-flavoured brown oxy-power fizzy Wonderoso for Eckie-Ecola. Our all-purpose cleansers are not intended for ingestion despite — allegedly — tasting twice as good as the leading alternative."

3. "The problem is not that detergents look like foods, it's that food looks like detergents," complains organic farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a misshapen turnip at you. "We should ban food colourings and any food additives that are designed to change the appearance of edibles. Once people get used to natural-looking produce, there'll be no chance of them mistaking a pastel-coloured soap product for food."

Attending a passing out ceremony this morning, a stand-off ensues when two officers of different ranks in the nation's sprawling military bureaucracy both insist the other salutes first. Twenty minutes of awkward posturing later, an aide suggests it might be time you intervened.

The Debate
1. "This is absolutely ridiculous!" exclaims Field Commander Four-and-a-Half Star Lieutenant-Colonel with fig leaf cluster Boyson Longfellow, arms held stiffly at his side as he stares down Grand Marshal Brigadier-Major first class Grace Shatner. "We officers should be afforded the respect our proud service warrants, through a plethora of ranks to tailor to every officer's skill set and service to the army, and it's every soldier's duty to understand their place in the hierarchy."

2. "Why should I be forced to remember every single rank?" pipes up pallid-faced orderly Luciano Beachcroft. "I got ten days of latrine scrubbing for not being able to distinguish between 162 varieties of epaulettes — how ridiculous is that? Military ranks must be made simpler if you want efficient battlefield decisions rather than generals squabbling like children." He looks mournfully at a worn toothbrush as both the Field Commander and Grand Marshal turn to glower at him.

"I tried to break up with her nicely, as I always do, but she won't take 'no' for an answer. Look at this — 426 unread messages already today — and it's only 2pm!

"Serial stalkers are known to have mental disorders that increase their infatuation with the object of their desire, leading to irrational and anti-social behaviour. Prison time will not cure them.

4. "But he promised to be with me forever! I don't want anyone else — he's the one for me," wails your brother's ex, appearing from behind the couch and giving him a vacant stare. Then she turns to you and smiles sweetly. "You should make it law that anyone who has been ditched has the right to watch over their ex constantly for the next six months.

As your Chief of Staff wraps up the latest whiz-bang press conference about a new government initiative, you're pretty sure you hear crickets in the room. That is, you probably would hear them, if not for the loud chorus of "Awwwwww" emanating from the state-controlled press pool, where most of the reporters are distracted by something on a monitor and are paying no attention whatsoever to the presentation.

The Debate
1. "Oi, losers! Pay attention!" snaps your murine-looking Chief of Staff, furiously launching an untouched stack of glossy full-color handouts into the distracted crowd. "You think we pay you to ignore what we have to say? And why is that live feed showing a rerun of last year's duckling parade instead of me? We've never forced your hand before, but this is too much... no more Mister Nice Government! From now on I want to see our message front and center on every platform!

Many years ago during a skirmish between Dàguó and the United Federation, the [i]UFS Fricking Awesome[/i] was sunk off the coast of @@NAME@@ with many lives lost. A United Federation businessman recently dived on the site to place a wreath, but discovered that the ship was completely gone, a casualty of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ metal salvagers.

The Debate
1. "That was a war grave!" declares Randy Cox III, the UF businessman, as his scuba gear drips water all over your office. "A local fisherman told me that the bones of the sailors who died on that ship were just dumped on a landfill. This is outright sacrilege! Not only must these piratical bottom-feeders be arrested, but @@NAME@@ must do all it can to protect other war graves in its waters; you need around the clock patrols by the coastguard and warships, whatever it takes!"

2. "That ship belonged in a museum!" shouts fedora-wearing archaeologist Illinois Smith. "Those wrecks need to be excavated by qualified archaeologists, and everything there brought onshore and preserved in the National Maritime Museum. Only responsible professionals like me can be trusted to take due care with these precious historical artifacts!" He twitches slightly, hoping no-one will mention the time he swapped an ancient imperial corpse for a diamond, or used an arm bone as a torch, or endangered an 11-year-old he had employed as an impromptu local guide.

3. "Let's not get in the way of business, shall we?" pontificates Achenar Ponta, the owner of a maritime metal salvaging company. "These ships contain tons of low-background steel, and salvage operations provide jobs and considerable economic and scientific benefit. The [i]legal principle[/i] of [i]'inventores possessores, amittentes lamentantes'[/i] clearly applies here. As for any organic impurities entangled in the salvage, they most certainly do not end up in landfill: they're hygienically cremated during the scrap melting process. I say that any ship sunk in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ waters is @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ property, and so long as we pay our corporation taxes you should be encouraging our entrepreneurship."

[4]. "I say there aren't enough shipwrecks in our waters," ponders Debra Wickwire, the owner of another salvaging company, as she takes a swig from your coffee before you have a chance to grab the cup. "Maybe the government could look the other way while we place a sea mine or two on the busier coastal trade routes. Companies like mine can then just lurk nearby, and we can clean up!" [Policy TBD]

[b][anchor=1546]#1546[/anchor]: Fool's Gold [Electrum; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
When @@NAME@@ instituted the gold standard, it brought transparency and stability to the sometimes-fickle economy. The economy responded strongly — so strongly, in fact, that the government is finding it difficult to maintain sufficient gold reserves to finance its growing obligations, should they suddenly be called in.

The Debate
1. "If we need more gold, then let's go digging!" hollers Minister for Creative Solutions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, excitedly hefting a pickaxe. "There are viable gold deposits right under @@CAPITAL@@ and some other big population centers. If we loosen restrictions surrounding the use of sodium cyanide, and allow some of the other practices needed for extracting gold from low-grade ore, we'll be able to boost our reserves in a jiffy! Now that's an Au-some idea."

2. "There's no need to do all that work... the real problem is private ownership of gold!" argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Minister for 'Creative' Solutions. "If our people are holding on to gold, then we can't use it to back our currency. We need to abolish private ownership of gold, and compel people to turn it in for its fair market value! Of course, there is the teeny-tiny complication of people hiding their holdings from the government, so we'll also need to establish a new investigatory agency to look into potential cases of hoarding."

*3. "We have an open economy — if we need more gold, we can trade for it!" observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your creative Minister for Solutions, known for @@HIS@@ connections to war zones across @@REGION@@. "Thing is, you don't just want to buy it using @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ — that'd be trading gold for gold. You need somebody willing to make a different sort of exchange. As it happens, I know some bloodthirsty rebels... err, I mean plucky freedom fighters, who would happily exchange some of their vast gold reserves for material support in the form of bombs and ammunition. Say the word and we'll turn lead into gold!" [[color=purple]Must not have Autarky[/color]]

*4. "The challenge is that we have a closed economy" observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your creative Minister for Solutions, known for @@HIS@@ connections to war zones across @@REGION@@. "Our ability to finance our obligations will always be limited by our domestic stock of gold. If we open our borders to trade, I bet I can find somebody willing to send us gold for something we don't need as much. As a matter of fact, I know some bloodthirsty rebels... err, I mean plucky freedom fighters, who would happily exchange some of their vast gold reserves for material support in the form of bombs and ammunition. Just say the word and we'll turn lead into gold!" [[color=purple]Must have Autarky[/color]]

**5. "This policy experiment has been madness! Why are you trying to save it?" pleads Ruel Taylor, an overwrought employee of the Central Bank of @@NAME@@ taking a break from haranguing passers-by about something called 'Floating Rates.' "There is no way we can mine, seize, or import gold fast enough to meet the demands of our swelling economy. End the gold standard and allow our currency to fluctuate again on the open market, or we'll suffer an economic catastrophe that makes our current limitations look like a holiday!" [[color=purple]Must not have Autarky[/color]]

**6. "This policy experiment has been madness! Why are you trying to save it?" pleads Ruel Taylor, an overwrought employee of the Central Bank of @@NAME@@, taking a break from haranguing passers-by about something called 'Currency Convertibility.' "There is no way we can mine, seize, or even import gold fast enough to meet the demands of our swelling economy. End the gold standard and return to issuing fiat currency, or we'll suffer an economic catastrophe that makes our current limitations look like a holiday!" [[color=purple]Must have Autarky[/color]]

[b][anchor=1547]#1547[/anchor]: The Return of the Prodigal Son [Baggieland; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
Some time ago, the government began abandoning children to raise themselves in the wild. Now, many of these feral children have come of age and are ready to rejoin society.

The Debate
1. "See what a success this policy has been!" boasts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Education, who has had very little to do these past few years. "We've saved so much money on schools, child services, hospital admissions... The state of nature is much more efficient than our government. On top of that, the wolves — or bears, or whoever — raised these children well with a sound grasp of family responsibility and societal togetherness. To take the next step, let's put these free-range @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ into the menial jobs no one else wants. @@ANIMAL@@ see, @@ANIMAL@@ do!"

2. "MY BABIES!" wails @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a mother who had to give up her children to the wild. "My home has been so empty these past years; I just want my little cherubs back... NOW! I don't care what physical or emotional state they're in, or whether they've brushed their teeth in living memory. A mother's love is all they need to once again become valued, cherished members of society."

3. "You can't just reintroduce these creatures into society without any checks," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Social Services, keeping @@HIS@@ distance from a formerly wild child who has also been brought into your office. "There should be at least a year's reintegration period at an educational institution, where these people can catch up on their language skills, as well as learn about human societal norms. They need to be supervised very carefully and have support staff available for them at every stage of their journey, for their own safety as well as ours."

4. "Grrrrrr," snarls the young @@MAN/WOMAN@@ in your office. "Me like forest. No like city. Me back to forest. Stay there. Forever." @@HE/SHE@@ bounds out of your office on all fours, swinging from the chandelier as @@HE/SHE@@ goes.

[b][anchor=1548]#1548[/anchor]: Killing in the Name of Beer [RedBrickLand; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
Ever since the establishment of prohibition in @@NAME@@, organized gangs have attempted to smuggle alcohol into the nation. The resulting conflicts between gangs and police have grown in size and frequency, until a recent incident sparked a full-scale battle which claimed the lives of multiple innocent civilians.

The Debate
1. "Won't somebody please think of the civilians?" wails perpetual gadfly Helen Hatesad, wringing her hands in despair. "Prohibition has turned @@NAME@@ into a dangerous nation full of police violence and trigger-happy gangsters, unsafe even for its own citizens. The only way to stop the violence is to repeal prohibition! Innocent lives are at stake here, @@LEADER@@! If somebody wants to drink themselves into a stupor, then at least they're only harming themselves."

2. "What about their family members?" snaps @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Ness, your Supervisor of Blocking Ethanol Revenue, as @@HE@@ slams @@HIS@@ fists on your desk. "Without prohibition, my screw-up son-in-law will be drinking booze all day, and when he gets drunk... I can't let that happen! Prohibition ain't the problem, it's the lack of funding to enforce it. If we allow booze, @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ will be even more at risk from alcoholism, liver disease, and drunken violence! You should give us more equipment and resources, so we can stop these smuggler gangs and respond to their violence at the same time. Things might get a little spicy at first, but if those gangsters think they can outgun the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ government, they've got another thing coming!"

3. "Don't raise the temperature — promote temperance! If we want to stop the gang violence, we have to remove the reasons people join gangs," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a local teacher, from the head of a children's tour group that has somehow made its way into your office. "Gangs are so powerful because they can recruit young, vulnerable, and disaffected teenagers, leading them into lives of violence and dipsomania. To stop gangs from taking advantage of the youth, we need more progressive social policies in education and welfare, to show kids there's another way. We should also run a public awareness campaign to educate young people about the dangers of public enemy number one: Mr. Alcohol. If we re-educate the people they recruit, the gangs will simply fade away!"

4. "You know, what if all this violence ain't so bad, eh?" interrupts a trenchcoat-wearing man outside your window, who you recognize as infamous mob boss Morbidly Obese Tony. "It keeps the do-gooders distracted, and I'm sure some people could even profit from this funny little situation. Say, why don't you 'inspect' the funds going to the police force? I mean, who's to say that they didn't kill those civilians themselves? And you know, since I'm such a charitable guy, I'll be sure to make a 'donation' to your party once you're done with all of this. You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours, capisce?"

The Issue
The clock chimes as you finally get home. Eleven bells. Is it really almost midnight? Your head is swimming from a day filled with inane meetings about park benches, how big supersize meals should be, and whether or not nuclear annihilation would really be a bad thing in the age of global warming (you figured it'd probably be fine, on balance). As you settle at your desk to finish a couple pieces of correspondence, you realise you've been doing this thankless job for twenty years now. Twenty years! A cause for celebration indeed, so maybe you can spare a couple of minutes to take a break. Thus the masochist within you has decided that, to celebrate this anniversary, "unwinding" on NationStates before bed would be "fun". There's so many things to do, though, and so little time — so what do you focus on?

The Debate
1. Ah, the General Assembly. The perfect place to go if you really want to waste time debating whether or not "shall" or "will" in a piece of legislation results in banning opposite-sex marriages, or potentially criminalising making your favourite horse a member of parliament. The friendly regulars, the welcoming Old Guard; they don't exist in the General Assembly. It's a free for all. It's sink or swim, baby. Publish or perish. Only lawyers need apply. Or something to that effect. If you want to exert control over what is and isn't legal in other nations, though, and mould a multiverse in the image of your own ideals, the General Assembly is exactly where you want to spend your time.

2. Then again, your trigger finger is itching to do some damage in International Incidents. First, you need to find a willing enemy. Then, you can demarcate the boundaries of bloodshed so no uninvited armies can interfere. And finally, you can test out those weapons of mass destruction that you've been eyeing in the shopfronts — only with your enemy's permission, of course. @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ aren't monsters.

3. Thinking on it, though, who needs permission? There's a whole world of regions out there, ripe for the taking. Even working alone, there's plenty to be accomplished, if you're content to play the long game. A word in the right ear here, a polite request for an endorsement there, it's all too easy playing a role — they'll never suspect who you were until it is far too late. Now which region was it you've always wanted to take down?

4. Of course, if a thrill is what you're after then there's bound to be a Sports tournament you can sign up for. Unfortunately, that's no guarantee of success; @@NAME@@'s athletes are at the mercy of fate! Maybe you should call upon the priestess Margaret to sacrifice 1093 rubber chickens to the random number deities on your behalf. But you'd better move fast, because it's almost cut off time!

5. That said, something inside has been gnawing at you. It has been a while. You look at the top of the page and see that you have five issues to address. The reason you first joined NationStates was to continue making decisions outside of work, even if those decisions had no real-world consequences. Except for those meaningless little golden badges on your page. Deep down in your heart of hearts, you know it's time to answer issues on all of your puppets. After all, you're just a primate who can't help but to push buttons for a dopamine release.

6. You then remember that the United Federation Intelligence Agency recently published the latest version of its World Factbook, a widely used resource amongst foreign diplomats for information about the world's nations. Much of the information it contained about @@NAME@@ was just plain wrong, and your own diplomats found themselves fielding dozens of calls asking if it was true that you had been replaced as leader by a @@ANIMAL@@. How much easier it is to set the record straight when you write your own factbooks! The stats are all wrong anyway — your words will tell the real story. If only somebody would read them.

7. Going to your Nation Page, you spot the little card icon staring back at you. Clicking it, you realise you have twenty-two copies of your own trading card. Perhaps this is a good time to add some variety to your collection — there are plenty of ongoing auctions, ready for you to swoop in at the last moment. All it takes is a nation, or fifty, to start sending you some gifts to sell. If you become wealthy enough, you can disguise your narcissism as altruism and stage a giveaway, or hoard a card that nobody will care about until you inflate its price to a ridiculous valuation. With every new pack comes the possibility of a legendary find...

8. The real treasure, however, is the hidden content. Do people even know about the NationStates Against Humanity minigame? Or the Challenge System? You should load up the secret URL and just wait an hour, or three, to see if anyone starts a game. Who cares if no-one turns up? You'll get that great feeling of knowing that you're part of a special elite, a secret Illuminati privy to mysteries that the hoi polloi know nothing of.

9. Out of nowhere, you're struck with the sort of idea that normally only occurs to one of your loopy cousins after a indulging in a mix of self-prescribed herbal remedies: what if you just bought the whole website? That Max Barry fellow certainly couldn't object to a new swimming pool filled with cash, courtesy of your National Treasury. With NationStates under your personal control, the site could finally have unending nuclear war! Zombie apocalypses that permanently affect your population! An IPO that actually earns you money! Maybe the admins could even bring back NationDates...

10. Seriously though, it'd be a terrible shame to waste all that money on a game where other people have the audacity to think their opinions matter — why, you've got literally all the answers to pressing real-life conundrums right here, inside of you! Indeed, people in general really should listen more to you. Wait, what is this? People in General arguing about left and right wing extremism? Gun control? Opinions on capitalism and cancel culture? Oh, abortion! [i]*knuckles crack*[/i] Yes, the world needs to hear from you on this.

11. Alas, the tyranny of choice is just exhausting. You had a long day, and you've spent so much time trying to decide what part of NationStates to play, it's almost time for bed. So how about you roll up your sleeves, pour a drink, and then just chill in one of the spam game threads for five or ten minutes? Whether it's pretending to be a brony, or calling the AN a talentless troubadour, sometimes reverting to childhood silliness is the best way to spend one's time.

[b][anchor=1550]#1550[/anchor]: A Friend With Weed Is a Friend Indeed? [Westinor; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
Recent reports have revealed that drug cartels are supplying the poorer citizens in @@NAME@@ with food and medical supplies, currying favor among the masses and in turn making it much harder for the police to apprehend drug kingpins. Several encounters between locals and law enforcement officials have escalated into full-on riots, with large crowds throwing rocks at police who were attempting to arrest suspected cartel members.

The Debate
1. "The downtrodden, the oppressed, the destitute: these are our people," claims militant weed distributor Ivana Smoke, who is rumored to run half of the black market operations in @@NAME@@. "We provide them with essentials that the government neglects, and in turn they shield us from unjust prosecution. This war on drugs is getting you nowhere — your own citizens aren't even on your side! Cease this mindless vendetta, and tell your pigs to stay out of my territory. Not only will innocent people stop getting hurt, but you can give everyone a tax cut since you won't need as many police. Don't you want to support the disenfranchised and the poor, @@LEADER@@?"

2. "Hey! Quick, grab 'er!" orders Police Chief Amber Kidman as several security guards attempt to tackle the kingpin, who disappears in a cloud of strange-smelling smoke. "Gah, we'll get them soon enough. @@LEADER@@, we can't let our glorious @@TYPE@@ be tainted by these ghastly substances. The best method of alleviating poverty is to crack down on all of the drug-pushing criminals that are trapping our people in a cycle of addiction. Give us more funding, more individual autonomy, and allow us to arrest any civilian seen in league with these dastardly thugs! That'll show those high-in-the-sky idiots who's boss."

3. "Brutality won't solve the problem; it'll just cause our streets to be awash with blood!" insists social worker Edward Rivera, who is often seen in @CAPITAL@@'s dingiest soup kitchens. "If you want to prevent people from aiding or joining the drug cartels, we need to improve the schools and social services in these marginalized areas, and open some food banks and medical clinics. By giving our less affluent citizens a path out of poverty, they won't need to rely on criminals for support, and the problem should dissipate... after several years of hard work, of course."

4. "Theesh people are doing ourrr own work for us!" exclaims your brother in extremely slurred speech as he takes a hit out of an impossibly large bong. "Let themm *hic* keep feeding them or whatever, and..." He doubles over and coughs several times. "We can focush on other stuff like *hic* tourism, or something. Isn't thish a great opportunity to promote our sight-seeing industryyy? I'm sure people would looove to feed the pheasants. Or something. Haha!" He then vomits on some important papers you were holding and passes out on the floor.

The Issue
Welfare Minister @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ was recently snapped by paparazzi on a seasonal shopping spree, looking positively dapper in a delightfully fashionable designer jacket. Unfortunately, the photos also show her walking past and pointedly ignoring charity volunteers asking her to make a donation to various worthy causes, a situation your PR people are referring to as "seriously bad optics."

The Debate

*1. "Ugh, those damn do-gooders have ruined my photo op, waving their stupid collection boxes in my face at the wrong time!" yells @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@. "Do you know how long it took me to do my hair that day? I mean sure, starving children in Kawandaland, children's hospitals in @@CAPITAL@@, and all that jazz... they're all terribly worthy causes.

3. "What, @@HE_1@@ couldn't spare a half-@@CURRENCY@@, so now the taxpayer has to foot the bill?" mocks your Treasury Minister. "@@LEADER@@, it'd be politically wise to fire this skinflint from your cabinet, and to publicly condemn @@HIS_1@@ lack of compassion, maybe while you're looking sad and tearful serving the homeless in the soup kitchen or something. It'd be a cheap way to make you look great, all while distancing yourself from political amateurs who make silly mistakes."

4. "Actually, I find those charity chumps pretty annoying too," chimes in your brother. "The other day I was being cornered by this spotty boy who kept going on about landmine victims, and he didn't go away till I wrote him a cheque. I can't wait till he reads what I wrote on it — suffice to say it contained canine speculations about his maternal lineage. You should make it illegal for these panhandlers to approach and harass people. If I want to donate, I'll walk over to donate. Otherwise, charity beggars should stand quietly and stay out of my way!"

The Issue
A raucous crowd draws your attention during your visit to the newest wing of the @@CAPITAL@@ Art Museum. The nation's artists and critics have gathered around controversial experimental artist Salvatore Niente's newest piece 'The Indefiniteness of Memory', an 'invisible' clock statue. They are all eager to give their impromptu opinions to you rather than to the nation's poorly circulated art periodicals.

The Debate
1. "Absolutely ludicrous, just look at it!" scoffs sculptor @@RANDOMNAME@@, throwing @@HIS@@ beret on the ground and stomping on it for good measure. "Oh wait, you can't, because it's literally nothing! Even the most gullible of the hoi polloi can tell you this is not art. True art should convey emotion, express creativity and help others see the beauty of the world! Concept art such as this has no place in these hallowed halls of the masters."

2. "How can anyone seek to establish arbitrary rules for creating art, or enforce styles of a bygone age?" inquires Salvatore Niente, protectively clutching the statue close to his body before being asked by the museum guards to step away from the exhibit. "My sculpture is made of air and spirit, requiring the viewer to use their full power of imagination to grasp. I make no apologies to philistines who don't know how to imagine. Really, you should be helping museums invest in thought-provoking and expensive art that appeals to the modern psyche, such as blank canvases, fruit taped to walls and even someone performing a guttural scream into a microphone."

[3]. "Who, like, even wants to go to an old boring building for art anyway? You have to walk around and look at what some stuck-up rich dudes thought looked cool hundreds of years ago," says your nephew, a 'crypto bro' hustling for some dough. "It'd be pog if you made a VR museum that showcases a curated collection of digital art. It's a good investment too, with fully guaranteed returns on the blockchain.

The Issue
A massive fire recently struck the vaults of famed @@DENONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ movie studio @@NAME_INITIALS@@GM, tearing through the complex in less than 15 minutes. Questionable storage practices and a lack of fire suppression systems led to the only known copies of many early @@DENONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ films being destroyed in the blaze.

The Debate
1. "This clearly shows that big companies can't be trusted with preserving our culture!" opines self-identified movie critic @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Dogme, best known for espousing the opinion that post-processing should be banned. "Those ignorant cretins couldn't give two @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ about 'An Investigation in Indigo,' or any other film that isn't raking in cash. In my unerring opinion, we need a national film archive with proper storage conditions and protection, overseen by people who truly appreciate the artform, such as yours truly.

*2. "This wouldn't have happened if those movies were digitized!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a digital media activist who only goes to theaters for the overpriced snacks. "Well, the fire probably still would've happened, but at least no one would actually care about it!

"Look at this stupid maths question I've got to answer: 'If a train is travelling at 40m/s, then applies the brakes at 1.1m/s2, how many football fields will it take to stop?' I've never watched a game of football in my life... this has no meaning to me whatsoever!

The Issue
Celebrity "wellbeing guru" Gwen F. Poltroon recommended to her social media followers that they should regularly clean their ears with cotton swabs (more commonly known by their brand name 'Cute Yips'). This has prompted audiologists and ENT doctors to express concern that doing so can damage ears by packing wax deeper, irritating ear canals and sometimes even perforating eardrums.

The Debate
1. Your short-statured and short-tempered health minister waddles angrily into your office, red in the face. "I have three little words for you: BAN THEM. Uh... PLEASE. No matter what we do, people are still going to use them incorrectly. The general public has proven itself too stupid and too weak-willed to resist sticking them in their ears."

2. "Look, we market these things as beautician tools, arts and crafts items and multi-purpose medical application devices. It even says here in the leaflet that you shouldn't put them in your ears," complains the CEO of Cute Yips, absent-mindedly twiddling a cotton bud in his ear. "Still, you have to respect bodily autonomy, and the right of individuals to do unwise things. I mean, honestly, in the interests of personal freedom we ought to be allowing Cute Yips to be marketed and sold specifically for these purposes, instead of being all nudge-nudge-wink-wink about it."

3. In a booming voice, the entrepreneur inventor of EarVacCleaner interrupts: "Here is a new and innovative solution! With its ergonomic design, the EarVacs2000 has the power and precision to remove up to 3 ounces of earwax! With regular government-funded ear suctioning programs, people will be empty-eared and will have no need for cotton buds. The EarVacs is completely safe. Compweetwee saaaaayfe." His left eye twitches and one shoulder droops as he starts to drool.

The Issue
Recently, a transgender woman was murdered by her abusive partner, despite seeking refuge in a shelter for victims of domestic and sexual abuse days beforehand. It turns out that she was initially given shelter, but then forced to leave again when it transpired that she was transgender.

The Debate
1. "Look, I'm sure transgender women think they are women," retorts infamous feminist campaigner and author Jay Kayer-Owling. "Women at these shelters are trying to get away from abusive men. They can't feel safe if men are in the same place, and will be afraid to seek help because of it. Only biological women should be allowed in our safe spaces. Perhaps these men in dresses can have their own separate shelters, if they need them, where they can stay with people of their own sort."

2. "Don't listen to that TERF! It's disgusting and disgraceful that anyone could try to justify a woman being sent back into such a violent and dangerous situation!" exclaims prominent transgender rights campaigner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, threatening the author with a lacrosse stick to emphasise her point. "All women deserve protection and safety from abuse, whether they are transgender or cisgender. Women's shelters must not discriminate! If you are a woman and you need shelter you should be granted it."

3. "Actually, anyone can need shelter, and that includes men," observes men's rights activist Watt Abe Owtus, who has been slapped in the face by women many times. "Shelters should be gender-blind, and allow anyone who needs refuge to stay there, whether it's because of abuse, homelessness or because their mum has told them they can't stay in their basement any more. I mean, it might be a good place for nice guys like me to meet women who need a white knight to save them. Not all guys are abusers, you know!"

4. "Can we not just recognise that transgender people are immoral, mentally ill or both?" asks conservative commentator @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Men cannot become women and vice versa no matter how many surgeries or whatever they get. That's just biology. We should criminalize cross-dressing, ban transgender ideas, and admit for mandatory psychiatric treatment anyone who insists on pursuing this perversion."

The Issue
Performance artist Maureen A Hamsandwich is launching a new exhibition tomorrow, wherein she intends to sit silently in a chair eight hours a day for a whole month. Visitors are invited to freely make eye or even physical contact if they desire. Surprisingly, you have received a personal appointment, scheduled to be the first of many to lock gazes with her.

The Debate
1. "Static and silent, this is a piece that explores the power of stillness," enthuses a fidgety cultural aide who looks suspiciously similar to the artist but in a red wig, buzzing around you excitedly. "I heard that in a similar performance elsewhere, some visitors broke down in tears as they confronted their internal monologues. You should plan to do something like that, and show the people that you really get postmodern art." She giggles, then dashes out of the room.

2. "She's clearly some sort of masochist, just wanting people to poke and emotionally abuse her," observes a passing intern, seemingly the last speaker's blonde twin, firing an office staple gun into the back of her own hand to emphasise her point. "So-called "artists" like this deserve to be mocked. You should go in there, give her a slap, berate her for wasting everyone's time, then head back to work. Busy busy." She looks at her watch and walks out, purposefully.

3. "Frankly, the whole thing bores me," yawns a civil servant, whose grey wig seems to be slipping off as she rushes in, out of breath. "Clearly, you're being drawn into the performance, used to generate free publicity. The best thing you can do is ignore the whole charade, and go across town to a different exhibition that is opening on the same day. I have a pamphlet here: Treasures of Romanticism, a Retrospective on Landscape Paintings of the Sublime. Actual brushwork, and realistic pictures. That's proper art, with none of this performance nonsense. I'll go ahead and grab you a ticket." She strides off.

The Issue
During a press briefing, which had somehow been booked at a landscaping business on the rough side of town, one of your aides received a vicious paper cut. Almost immediately, your entourage found itself being led towards a set of dilapidated buildings to seek care. What your staff had mistaken for abandoned apartments turned out to be a hospital – a stark contrast to the world-class medical facilities in the posh enclaves across town.

The Debate
1. "For decades our health and well-being have been neglected, and we won't take it any longer!" declares exasperated local resident @@RANDOM_NAME@@, lingering next to you in the waiting room. "Are we not @@DEMONYM@@, too? My neighborhood shouldn't determine the quality of the healthcare facilities I visit, and I shouldn't have to sit in a dingy waiting room for hours just to see an overworked triage nurse who's already got twenty other patients! We demand more health subsidies for poor neighborhoods, and hey, maybe you can require that junior doctors serve in our hospitals for a few years, as a condition for getting their full license?"

2. "The problem isn't the resources they have – it's how they use them! Did you read about all the fraud, waste, and abuse going on?" interjects Minister of Health @@RANDOM_NAME@@, flipping through a spiral-bound copy of @@HIS@@ ministry's latest several-hundred-page report. "Hospitals like this are typically poorly equipped, poorly maintained, and churn through staff, because their administration is too busy paying for executive washrooms in their offices, and 'management retreats' at fancy resorts. What they really need is additional oversight! Allocate funds to my budget and I'll enact more stringent regulations, with routine inspections to ensure all hospitals are up to par."

3. "You can't put a bandage on a fourth degree burn and expect it to heal!" cries the hospital's head surgeon, suddenly leaping into the room with a reflex hammer in one hand and a diagram of a sickle cell in the other. "This is a symptom of that great plague upon our nation: for-profit healthcare! The rich can afford luxury treatment while the poor suffer in dirty, understaffed hospitals, all while insurance and pharmaceutical companies profit off their hardship. The solution is clear: nationalize healthcare, and let us provide equal care for all, regardless of residence, finance, or social class!"

4. "If you don't like the healthcare you're getting, pack up and move," butts-in @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a 'self-made' business@@MAN@@ here performing community service after @@HIS@@ most recent public escapades got reported to authorities. "What makes @@NAME@@ so great is that if you're unhappy with your current conditions, you can change them with just a little hard work. The government doesn't need to spend all this unnecessary money or make weird, complicated regulations. Instead, you should drastically cut your healthcare spending. That will encourage these unhappy people to find better jobs and improve their own circumstances. It's the @@DEMONYM@@ way!"

The Issue 
One of your nephews decided to go under the needle, and cover half of his body in a veritable panoply of tattoos depicting various scenes from a number of Nicolas Cage movies. As a result, he was fired from his job as a school receptionist.

The Debate
1. Your nephew, flexing his arm to make Ghost Rider and H. I. McDunnough dance with each other, complains to you: "This is nothing less than obvious discrimination! I was excelling at my job, had Employee of the Month three times running, my colleagues said I was a kick-ass national treasure. But as soon as I got all inked up, my job was stolen from me, gone in sixty seconds, given away to my assistant Mandy. There goes my job at Ridgemont High! You have to stop businesses from discriminating against those who want to express themselves. In fact, you have to protect the rights of free expression and bodily autonomy, and make sure that nobody ever is discriminated against for what they choose to write or draw on their body. You know, it could happen to anyone, it could happen to you."

2. "There's no good reason not to fire a person who chooses to put something like that on their body," counters school governor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Personally, I don't trust people who have tattoos; their rebellious self-mutilation suggests criminal nature and disrespect for authority. I want our employees to look professional, and to set a good example to children. He voluntarily altered his appearance, and the law must respect the right of employers to terminate employees who violate appearance standards."

The Issue
Shock! Horror! Posthumously unearthed diaries have revealed that @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_1@@, a beloved composer of chart-topping disco songs, was secretly homosexual and had engaged in illegal homosexual relations. In retrospect, the titles of some of his compositions (such as "I Stand Behind the Sky", "Come On, Christopher" and "Bent but Unbroken") may have contained clues to this.

The Debate
1. "So, @@LASTNAME_1@@ was a deviant, eh?" muses Minister of Standardising Deviation, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We can't allow his homosexual music to corrupt the minds of our youths any longer. Condemn him, ban his works, exhume then re-bury him in an unmarked grave, and salt the earth. Damn his filthy perversions!"

2. "That's not enough," interjects your Minister for Variance Reduction. "The entire genre of disco pop music is likely harbouring other closet homosexuals. We must ban that genre. In fact, we must ban any genre of music that is revealed to have homosexual influences in it. Straight music only, that is the path to cultural purity."

3. "I'm not sure why music fans should be deprived of great works because of the artist's dirty secrets," complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of Kings and Queens of Disco, the official @@LASTNAME_1@@ fan society. "Athough clearly gay people and inheritors of their estate should not be allowed to profit from fame, we should still get to play their music if we want. The government must seize the compositions and place them in the public domain. This will allow culture to be preserved while continuing to punish homosexuality."

4. "Look... if someone as well-respected as @@FIRSTNAME_1@@ turned out to be gay, then maybe not all gay folk are so bad," suggests your uncle, without looking up from his Musical Revue Monthly magazine. "He was decent enough to keep his private life private. Maybe we should say that people should be allowed to be queer if they want, as long as they don't make a song and dance about it. Ooh, look, they're talking about bringing Avenue Cute to @@CAPITAL@@. How fabulous!"

The Issue
After serving his sentence, convicted axe murderer William @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@ launched the lucrative designer clothing line Bloody Bill's, with his controversial 'criminal chic' style a hit amongst edgy fashionistas.

The Debate
1. "This is outrageous!" objects @@RANDOMNAME@@, rival clothing designer and parent of one of the murder victims. "We can't allow murderers to make money from their crimes! Profiting from criminal actions, even indirectly, ought to be illegal! His business should be shut down, and he should get a job that doesn't involve exploiting his notoriety."

2. "Look, I've served my time and paid my debt. Everyone needs a job, and I'm just trying to show entrepreneurial spirit as a law-abiding citizen," argues the killer, sporting a white hoodie with a striking blood splatter pattern around the neck. "Without a proper form of income, how are former convicts supposed to rejoin society? If ex-cons are forced into debt or poverty, then recidivism rates will increase. Surely, one bad deed — or six, in my case — can't condemn a man forever, right? Show your commitment to the free market by donning my winter collection in public, and society will benefit."

The Issue
After last night's live television coverage of one of your speeches was interrupted for the third time by government censors, citing "non-preapproved speculation about the significance of @@LEADER@@'s tone of voice," the network anchor went into a completely off-topic rage. His several-minute rant blasted a nationwide audience with complaints ranging from a "total lack of press freedom" to your alleged "draconian censorship of anything and everything."

The Debate
1. "How can you call us the free press if we're not allowed to say anything?" demands @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Prole, the anchor in question, only slightly calmer now than @@HE@@ was on air last night. "Any time I try to speak, some government stooge runs up waving a copy of Regulation 198.4, claiming I've violated yet another absurd restriction. They once tried to stop me from saying 'rain' because it sounded like 'reign!' You have got to back off the censorship and allow us to speak freely, or no one will bother watching the news in the first place!"

2. "I'll always watch you!" interjects @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@'s big brother Koa, who serves as Deputy Minister for Media Content Regulation. "That way I can ensure your compliance! Actually, now that you mention it, that does seem a tad inefficient. Hey @@LEADER@@, why don't we just absorb the press into the apparatus of state? Instead of trying to monitor and regulate all these dangerous free-thinkers, we can just write the scripts for them and stop worrying about when some journalist is secretly having a bad day.

The Issue
During a publicity appearance at the local agricultural fair, you noticed signs advertising potatoe's, tomatoe's, banana's, and groceries'. When your aide questioned the stallholders about their punctuation, it became apparent that none of them had the slightest clue on how to use an apostrophe.

The Debate
1. "The apostrophe is used when there is a contraction or to mark the possessive case," affirms Avery Ampersand, Administrator of the Adopting Appalling Atrocities Aimed at All Apostrophe Abusers Association. "It's the easiest thing in the world to use. The mouth-breathers who misuse the apostrophe should be sent to remedial training camps, where they will be beaten with a copy of Stunk and Violet's Pedantic Punctuation Pedagogy until they learn how to write properly!"

2. "Whoa, whoa, whoa!!!! Are we introducing corporal punishment for misusing apostrophe's???" reads a text message from the Minister for Education, who is at a stall serving chill'd drink's, not wanting to yell over the crowd. "What next?? Are you going to fire me for using too many question marks and exclamation points!!!! People make mistake's with apostrophe's all the time. Surely the solution is more money for school's and universitie's to teach punctuation and how to use autocorrect? That should resolve the i'ssue to everyone's satisfaction. Oops... that last apostrophe was autocorrect."

3. You notice that a nearby wooden post has something scrawled on it in a long meandering line: "why are we taught punctuation at school they make everyone write so formal like and someone should put a stop to that a famous poet once said just go with the flow and chillax let your words and your spirit run as free and wild as the coursing river and wandering wind"

The Issue
On the way to a photo op with the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ national women's goat-farming team, your driver missed a turn, leaving you lost just outside @@CAPITAL@@. Thankfully, you spy some hitchhikers approaching — except it appears they're lost too. Making matters worse, they've recognized you, and apparently now is the perfect time to complain about the problem bringing you all together: @@NAME@@'s poor road signage.

The Debate
1. "We need better road signs!" shouts a young woman in a checkered dress, cradling a dog in her arms. "We've been trying to find some silly castle for days! All we were told was if we 'followed the yellow brick road' then it would lead us straight there. Do you have any idea how many freaking yellow brick roads there are in @@NAME@@? It feels like we've followed a million already! Why don't you invest in some better road signs so that we can easily figure out where we're going instead of dealing with these archaic descriptions?"

2. "Now hold on. This may sound heartless, but what makes you think the owner of this castle WANTS to be found?" queries the next person, sounding surprisingly reasonable in light of his literal tinfoil hat. "Sometimes it's nice to have a quiet spot, free from all the hustle and bustle — no lunatics, or madmen, or Girl Scouts selling cookies. Surely you've got somewhere secret that only you know about, a peaceful place to get away from it all. Now imagine everyone and their dog just following signs straight there! No, what this country needs to do is get rid of ALL road signs, to keep out the riff-raff. Long live the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ hideout!"

3. The third member of the group, who must be a farmer judging by the hay adorning his shirt, suggests a different alternative. "I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but I reckon there has to be a better option than all-or-nothing. The problem wasn't with every sign; you just didn't have the ones we needed! I propose you put up a whole lot of special road signs, just for tourists. Direct them to landmarks and obvious places — that way you can keep all of your secret spots, but tourists can still find the important things! Help anyone go see the @@CAPITAL@@ Arch, whether or not they're geographically challenged like us."

4. "P-please, your excellency!" whimpers another person, whose hair is so thick it can only be described as a mane. "I'm mustering a lot of courage to talk to you right now! I get so terrified when I drive — oh, so many things could go wrong! I could run off a cliff, someone could hit me, or worse, I could miss a turn! What we really need isn't road signs — we need better technology to ease my anxiety. I hear they've got fancy internet-navigation-things in other countries — maybe you could let us get some of them, or something..."

5. The final complainant, a tall lady in a black cloak — whose odor suggests she hasn't seen a bath in some time — cackles. "Hahahahaha, don't you see, my pretty? You're simply stuck in the past! Roads are soooo outdated... public transport is the way of the future! High-speed rail, metro services, ferries, the whole lot! With an expanded public transport system covering @@NAME@@ from north to south, we'll stop being so dependent on roads — and their signs."

It turns out your Minister of Health couldn't stand the smell of stale hot dog water wafting through open office windows, and declared the whole event "a grotesque public health risk" in order to clear the air.

The Debate
1. "Ugh, I can't stand the smell of hot dogs anymore, after days of putting up with this competition!" whimpers your Minister of Health, dry-heaving at the memory. "Incidentally, this kind of behavior is actually known to be extremely unhealthy! It's a shame that @@NAME@@ has resorted to watching people hedonistically engorge themselves for entertainment, and it sends a terrible message to our children! We should be promoting healthful eating wherever possible. Maybe competitive vegetable eating? That would be an activity I could support!"

2. "I don't see the justification for banning something just because one person can't stomach it," drawls defending champion Bowie Peanut, who has sauntered over from the convention center. "Competitive eating is a noble activity that celebrates the joy of a good meal. If you permit our event, we'll come back every year and bring in boatloads of tourists to splash some cash on the culinary delights of @@NAME@@!

The fracas was triggered when supporters of a long-criticized hypothesis about the so-called "Triangle-Spin of the @@ANIMAL@@-Particle" were refused presentation time, being told only that their ideas were "just plain stupid." With bloody bowties dripping red, the partisans have been dragged to your office, still hollering at each other about scientific consensus and a researcher's right to be heard by their peers.

The Debate
1. "This Triangle Spin idea has never been proven!" screams prescriptive physicist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, poking your chest with @@HIS@@ ceremonial trinket of the relatively new and popular 'Quadrangle-Spin' clique. "In fact, all scientific inquiry has suggested otherwise! Those Trispinners are holding back scientific progress. Do you know how much taxpayer money is wasted on such nonsense? We are supposed to be unbiased seekers of truth. You must force all state-funded researchers to bow to the consensus of the scientific community, and cut them off if they spread false ideas!"

2. "HERETIC!" screeches descriptive chemist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, throwing an invisible handful of alleged '@@ANIMAL@@-Particles' in your face. "Those people have forsaken the search for truth, and they are trying to silence our voices! I beg of you, stop this tyranny. Science has always been about questioning the world around us. Forbidding free scientific expression will only lead to stagnation in the field. You must equally fund all areas of investigation regardless of mainstream consensus, and see to it that our voices are heard."

3. "It is important not to conflate beliefs with facts," advises emotive psychologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pouring a glass of cold water over the fuming academics. "In the end, we all must get along with each other somehow, so it's healthy and important to communicate clear boundaries. The organizers of state-sponsored conferences should be allowed to choose which presentations they permit, but they also should be required to publicly declare their biases and interests in advance, so citizens can decide if their taxes are being wisely spent."

[4]. "The real problem here is clear: science is the opiate of academia," states neo-theologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ smugly, holding a copy of [i]The Dog Delusion[/i]. "Science has been the reason for so many conflicts, fighting each other over which theory is real. All over the world, science is used to discriminate, to make weapons, and to wage war.

The institute is now seeking to patent and sell this cure, claiming that consent was acquired to test and study blood samples prior to commencing the analysis, and that the small print clearly stated that the product of any research would be the property of the institute.

The Debate
1. "Our special genes belong to us!" roars town resident @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has the bulging eyes and odd cheekbone structure borne of generations of inbreeding. "Just reading our DNA ain't research, and us saying they can study our blood don't give them ownership of us! Prevent that greedy institute from patenting the cure! Though, I reckon we can come to some kind of arrangement if they want to license our genes."

2. "Look, all those country bumpkins did was give up a little blood," insists Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while placing a teetering stack of research papers on your desk with a loud thud, followed by an even taller stack of legal papers. "We got proper informed consent, provided compensation, and followed all protocols.

3. "Why are we arguing over this?" asks Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while collecting and brushing dirt off of the scattered papers. "We have a cure for a deadly disease.

"These potatoes are minuscule and irregularly shaped, and the cow that yielded this steak simply must have been anemic!" complains celebrity chef Ankohl Rojer, flambéing a wok full of rice precariously close to your face. "We clearly need to subsidize and train the nation's farmers so they take better care of their plants and livestock!"

2. "A poor chef blames the ingredients! The problem is how they're prepared!" roars restaurateur Korton Lamsey, blasting the wok with a fire extinguisher. "Most chefs in this nation have no idea what sous vide means, they think ketchup's the only type of sauce, and their lamb is so undercooked that it follows Mary to school!

2. "Don't listen to that nutter! Let's come up with a more reasonable solution," suggests your Minister for Foreign Appeasement, brushing bits of glass out of @@HIS@@ hair. "Look, there's no need for hullabaloo. We can't let these scumbags get in the way of my job... I mean, the relationships and trust we have spent many years building up! We need to respect their territory and not step a single foot in these embassies without their permission. Let's try catching these criminals through good old diplomacy — surely giving up their asylum seekers in exchange for reduced maple syrup tariffs is an offer Brancaland can't refuse?"

3. "Why should we give those Brancalandian ice weasels anything? The problem should sort itself out soon enough," advises Minister of Practicalities @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while reviewing a dossier on the fugitive. "After a few months of having that loudmouth muckraker living in their embassy, spouting his nonsense conspiracy theories and attempting to sell everyone's national secrets to the highest bidder, Brancaland will be looking for an excuse to give him the boot. If we station police officers at every possible exit point, we'll be able to arrest him eventually. Let's just hope that he doesn't sell all of our top secret intel to Blackacre before that happens..."

4. "You lot are such amateurs," chides the ambassador from Althaniq, who was trying to persuade you to consider a camel exchange program when your advisors barged in. "You shouldn't get pushed around like this, but you also shouldn't go in guns blazing like a bunch of fools, or waste your time with a siege. Want to get rid of these asylum seekers and get away with it? Sneak a few operatives through the back door... and terminate with extreme prejudice."

[b][anchor=1570]#1570[/anchor]: Holistic Healers Hassle Holy Hospitallers [Vacatio Libertas; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
After a gang of religious zealots burned down a cupping and coin rubbing clinic for "waylaying the souls of the sick," a mass of meditative magnet healers responded by destroying the pharmacy in a church-run hospital, accusing them of "taking advantage of desperate families." As factional violence threatens to impact more of the nation's faith-affiliated healthcare facilities, temporal authorities are hesitating, uncertain of what stance to take in this spiritual standoff.

The Debate
1. "This 'alternative medicine' is a symptom of a moral plague which has been gnawing at the soul of every @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@," explains a solemn priest from the Church of Confounding Commandments. "These fruitless endeavors to heal the sick with crystals and essential oils are not simply an alternative to medicine, but an attempt to replace the faith which has served us well for so long. Our earthly bodies need doctors and medicine, it is true, but our soul needs something more. Perhaps the government should pay for every hospital to have a whole passel of priests and spiritual advisors?"

2. "We don't need your 'medicine!'" interrupts practicing chiropractor Karen Ducksworth. "We all know that you priests care more about your donation baskets than you do any REAL faith, and those egghead doctors and their so-called cures have killed more people than any of us havening herbalists and holistic healers ever have!" She breathes a comically heavy sigh. "Leader, if you really want your people to be happy AND healthy, then the government needs to support alternatives to big pharma and big God!"

3. "WHAT IN SCIENCE'S NAME IS THIS?" fumes a red-faced Dr. Norm Allen, an impatient public health expert. "We doctors put in time to research, develop, and administer real, scientifically backed cures to the good people of @@NAME@@, and now these quacks are trying to poison our people with God-particle-knows-what! We need more funding for quality public hospitals that don't shove religion down our throats, and we need to crack down on these pseudoscientific swindlers, regardless of whether their beliefs are new age or old-time religion."

4. A dark figure emerges from a shadow and bids you into the blackness. "Oh @@LEADER@@, the mortals speak silly words." Reaching into his deceptively large black cloak, he presents you with a bottle of liquid bleach. "The solution is not within us, it is all around us! The universe is but one great mess, a mess which must be cleansed and purified! Rid this nation of these mortals' delusional cures, and tell them to drink bleach!"

The Issue
In the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Premier League, perennial giants West @@CAPITAL@@ Albion, @@CAPITAL@@ United, and Sporting Club @@NAME@@ were all punished with relegation in the biggest match-fixing scandal in the league's history. Subsequent investigations have revealed mafia involvement, with their sticky fingers in every part of the footballing pie.

The Debate
1. "How could we allow the mafia to get so brazen?" questions your burly head of the @@NAME@@ Gendarmerie, showing off with a display of push-ups. "There are a lot of malicious activities going on in the underbelly of sports: match-fixing, bribery, financial doping, actual doping, and not to mention their thugs who threaten rivals. These mob criminals, and those who consort with them — like the shady owners and even some players — must be prosecuted. Give me and my agency more power and we will clean up all of the rot."

2. "Good riddance to the Unholy Trinity!" shouts Desmond Doe, a die-hard fan of minnow club @@ANIMAL@@ City Wanderers, as he sheds a crocodile tear at the demise of the 'big three'. "They have been controlling the entire league for decades with their serpentine corruption. It's good that these evil teams have been punished, but we must prevent it from happening again. I insist that the government implements a sports watchdog to oversee the integrity of the game in order to save @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ football from these vultures."

3. "Hey, just fuggedaboutit!" exclaims Arnie Redstone, elegantly dressed in his "Chicago outfit" as he proffers you a giant check with a whole lot of zeros on it. "What are those rascals whining about? We are financing @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ football to make sure only the best win the title. It's good for fans, good for the sport, and good for @@NAME@@. Make the footballing authorities reverse the relegation of those clubs my associates and I have an interest in, and get the five-oh off our backs. Otherwise @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ football will never be able to compete with those foreign super leagues. Capisce?"

4. "Again, why have we allowed sports itself to corrupt our nation?" opines Orion LeCarré, a chess grandmaster who prefers pastimes that don't require any physical strength. "Think of all the bad things professional sports have resulted in. You got the aforementioned mafia scandal, the doping scandal of Vance Armstorm in the Tour de @@NAME@@, Althaniq hosting the bloody IFF Global Cup, it's all too much! We'd be better off without the corrupting influence of organized sport."

The Issue
The latest environmental audit of government activities has pointed the finger firmly at one department for failing to meet emissions-reduction targets: the military.

The Debate
1. "We need to totally overhaul our military hardware," declares environmental auditor Ashley Sestero, flicking between slides of smoke-belching tanks, oil-burning warships, and single-use plastic explosives. "We've got blueprints here for some excellent new designs that will massively improve our performance: biodegradable natural hemp fatigues, electric main battle tanks backed up by a series of charging points around the border, recyclable rocket motors that can be collected and re-used, solar-powered night-vision headsets, submarines with sails for surface operations — just show us the money, and we'll have a military the envy of campaigners across the world."

2. "Procuring all new equipment is prohibitively expensive, not to mention the emissions from manufacture," scoffs appropriations administrator Faramir Barry, probably the only person in the room who knows a carbine from a cannon. "We can get a long way by modifying existing kit and practices. If we fit rate limiters to emissions-heavy machine guns, remove heavy armor plates to limit fuel consumption, and avoid explosions at all costs, then we'll be well on the way to winning the war against harmful emissions. That sounds much more reasonable, doesn't it?"

3. "Uh, your focus here is all wrong," interjects military botanist Ksenya Golightly, nursing a handful of cut daisies callouslyhc decapitated by an aerial bomb. "The direct damage being caused to biodiversity is way bigger than any narrow focus on emissions. Our forces need to stay out of all ecologically vulnerable areas: marshland, sand dunes, acid grasslands, primeval forests, mangroves, peat bogs, coral reefs, migratory geese airspace, chalk rivers, pristine arctic tundra..." She continues for several more minutes, finally ending with, "...and avoid artificial lighting at night that might confuse bats and moths. Perhaps we can arm our soldiers with seed bombs so they can make a start at undoing all the damage they've done?"

[b][anchor=1573]#1573[/anchor]: Unseen Academia [Cefalonia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
It is common practice for academics and researchers to submit papers to specialist journals, who in turn will publish and archive them online. However, many of these journals place their archives behind paywalls, charging access fees to those seeking to download them.

The Debate
1. "This is ridiculous!" shouts Pontius Tibbons, an overworked graduate student from @@CAPITAL@@ University. "These journals are charging way too much for people to access their papers, and it makes comprehensive research impossible! I'm broke already; I can't be expected to pay a hundred dollars to a hundred journals to perform a proper meta-analysis on the migration patterns of northern yellow-bellied @@ANIMAL@@ beetles. The government needs to unchain academia by forcing these journals to provide universal free access to their archives. The journals will complain, surely, but you can sweeten the pot by giving them a small government stipend for each paper they publish."

2. "Now just hang on a second there," says Dean Henry, a representative from the online journal 'The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Naturist', which was the recent subject of an exposé accusing it of naked mercantilism. "We have significant running costs in quality control, server maintenance, editing expenses, image rights, SPF50 sun lotion, and so on, and so forth. Adequate funding is essential for high quality publications, and we should be free to charge whatever prices we think the market will bear. You don't want bad journals running amok, do you?"

3. "There is another option," interjects Glen de Shugabeen, author of the new book [i]Socialism and You: Why Big Government Isn't so Bad[/i]. "Why don't we forbid these greedy journals from existing in the first place? All they do is exploit people and hold science itself hostage! The government can take over the publishing process for scientific papers instead. That way, we can have the best of both worlds: the government can filter out poor-quality papers, and still make them free for everyone! I'm sure there won't be any problems with the government deciding what data gets published, right?"

The Issue
At a recent cockfighting match in downtown @@CAPITAL@@, a vicious brawl between rival supporters of the two roosters — no doubt intoxicated by the smell and sight of blood — ended up causing severe injuries to ten people. As a result, a heated debate has been sparked about what to do with blood sports such as cockfighting, dogfighting and bullfighting.

The Debate
1. "We have to put an end to this madness," sighs flustered police constable @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@HIS@@ feathers clearly ruffled at this latest workload increase. "These animal fighting matches are organised and spectated mostly by gangsters and illegal syndicates, so they're hotspots for all sorts of criminal activities from pickpocketing to drug dealing. We need to show them who rules the roost by enforcing strict regulations at these matches: stewards, metal detectors, all-seater arenas, and ensuring everyone is at least 50 metres from the fighting, so they don't get too riled up."

2. "Simply restricting these barbaric activities is not enough," clucks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the @@CAPITAL@@ chapter of the Animal Safety Society. "These poor creatures are bred and raised just to be vicious fighting machines. They're kept in inhumane and crowded cages until it's time to lead them out to their deaths. We inflict all this trauma on them, and for what? Self-gratification. We need to banish all cruel sports from our civilised country and make sure these sentient beings are sent to animal rehabilitation centers."

3. "Oh, come on, I didn't come here to get hen-pecked by you wusses," scoffs cockfighting kingpin @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ strokes @@HIS@@ prized cock. "Blood sports are an integral part of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ culture. Sure, things might get a little heated at times, but it's not as bad as it's cracked up to be. If anything, you should be promoting these sports. Tourists pay top dollar to catch these legendary battles, and you could get a share of the dosh from taxes. It's a win for all of us!"

[4]. "No need to brood over this; there's a simple compromise!" exclaims your Minister of Creative Solutions from under your desk, as he unplugs your computer to connect a gaming console. "Check it out — Matador Manager! If we promote these ultra-violent video games to the populace, then we can save animals from being attacked in the real world and stop crime from being committed at physical events, all the while ensuring we don't lose a part of our culture!

The Issue
Substantial delegation of responsibility to local authorities certainly brought power closer to the people, and helped address local concerns more specifically. However, it also paved the way for wide gaps to open in the development of different regions.

The Debate
1. "We're in dire straits," opines @@RANDOM_FIRSTNAME_1@@ @@RANDOM_LASTNAME_1@@, who governs the extremely poor northernmost province of @@NAME@@. "We're doing all we can, but businesses just don't want to move out to us! Unemployment is skyrocketing, welfare and medical services are overburdened, and people are leaving in droves. It's a disaster! If you took just a little bit more tax from the wealthier provinces, maybe you could put some sweet incentives in place to lure big companies back and stimulate our economy? What I wouldn't give to pass through the shadow of a giant Microcosm centre on the way to my office..."

2. "Don't listen to that fool," instructs @@RANDOM_FIRSTNAME_2@@ @@RANDOM_LASTNAME_1@@, who governs the richest province in the nation — and just so happens to be @@RANDOM_FIRSTNAME_1@@'s younger sibling. "Why do you think they're in such a terrible situation to begin with? It's because SOMEONE surrendered to cheap populism and fiscal irresponsibility!

The Issue
One of your senior government ministers recently missed a speaking engagement at an important conference due to a delay caused by having a small bottle of water tucked in a carry-on bag at the airport. A horde of soi-disant policy wonks has intercepted you as you step off a plane, shouting their proposals to overhaul the complicated system of checks and restrictions at airport security.

The Debate
1. "The problem, @@LEADER@@, is that we're stuck being reactionary," sighs security manager @@RANDOM_NAME@@, after filling out the paperwork for her 74th water bottle seizure of the day. "We're always adding new policies after a threat has been discovered, but we never get rid of policies when they're no longer needed. Liquids used to be a problem, because some explosives resemble water, but we have the detection technology now to make such measures redundant. Pay for airports to have CT luggage scanners, threat analysis based on machine learning, and other cutting-edge technologies. That will keep those lines moving!"

2. "If we reduce restrictions, the terrorists win!" bellows hawkish legislator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, grabbing the water bottle and eyeing it suspiciously. "Terrorism thrives on fear, not actual effects! How does John Q. Public know what's in this? How does Susie Homemaker feel if we let unknown items on planes? Things like our liquid ban both ensure citizens feel safe, and act as visible deterrents that discourage terrorist actions. As a matter of fact, I think another couple restrictions might help us show the public how much we care!"

3. "It's not a liquid, it's water!" retorts your brother, ignoring confused looks and taking a sip to make his point. "If water's the problem, you should just make an exception so security doesn't need to worry about it. If a passenger says it's water, have them take a drink to show it's harmless and let them be on their way. Oh, that case from the duty-free store? Don't worry, that's all just water. Here, I'll prove it!"

4. "Seems to me that the real problem is all these carry-on bags," offers flight attendant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shuddering as a passenger trundles past with a large rollaboard. "Security lines would be a breeze if you just prohibited passengers from carrying all these unsafe items like suitcases, laptops, and purses. If they need a drink while on the plane, we'll be happy to sell them water at a reasonable mark-up, all government-screened and taxed, of course!"

When former customer care agent @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ became unemployed, @@HIS@@ unemployment advisor told @@HIM@@ that @@HIS@@ benefits might be sanctioned for several months if @@HE@@ failed to take any job offered. Subsequently a local brothel scouting for new talent spontaneously offered @@HIM@@ a job, which @@HE@@ refused. As a result, @@HE@@ has been told @@HE@@ will no longer be entitled to state handouts.

The Debate
1. "Look, our office guidelines are quite clear," snaps unemployment advisor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ writes a letter sending a stroke patient for an interview as a hod carrier. "Job-seekers have to take any work they can do, regardless of what they have previously done, their suitability, or their views on said work. If they reject a perfectly good job, they're clearly not a serious job-seeker and the sanction is correct. What does @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@ expect? Beggars can't be choosers."

2. "A beggar?" snorts the flashily dressed William Thénardier Esq., proprietor of a well-reputed bordello, and founder of the [i]Association of Sexophonists and Sexologists[/i]. "If my line of work — and the honest ladies and gents who participate — were not regarded with such snobbery, this fine @@DEMONYM@@ would not have baulked at an interview with my esteemed competitor. What other line of work is so historic, provides the chance to meet so many well-known individuals, offers full health benefits, and yet is so sneered at by prudes earning half the income? We do not want the press-ganged working in our establishments. But, were the benefits of this storied profession properly advertised, lines of eager beavers would form for employment daily."

3. "It wouldn't have made any difference," whispers @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@, nose quivering with revulsion. "I was taught one should only... make the two-backed demon with someone you plan to be with forever. I can't work in a... a disorderly house. I do want to work; I've applied for everything, even giraffe habitat scrubber. But, surely working in a... a bagnio is different? It's not just serving customers and asking them to please come again... this is, well it's... it's the most personal thing two individuals can share. Acknowledging that, shouldn't we treat prostitution differently, and not sanction people who believe the hoo-hoo and ha-ha shouldn't be a hoo-ha until the love hoopla?"

4. "Why should anyone have to take any job, even those who don't talk like some character from Willie le Po?" muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is a freelance economic theorist, and author of Work Doesn't Work: Wasted Lives at 9 to 5s. "Forcing people into poor-quality, insecure work is more stressful than unemployment. You can't force artisan underwater basket weavers into the Big Cheese industrial dairy complex without interrupting their training, slashing their earning potential, and still expect them to function. People aren't replaceable cogs. Benefit sanctions should be banned, with advisors nurturing clients to find the perfect fit for them — however long it takes. That way, at least employers will end up with workers who want to stick around... if you're into that."

You're sat in the office gardens after a state banquet when it occurs to you that dessert tasted unusually earthy. Did that intern chef mess up the food? It's been an hour or so, and as an unavoidable nausea begins to spread throughout your body, things are starting to feel a little... magical.

The Debate
1. "Everything will be alright!" rejoices a hallucination of the dead ethnobotanist Clarence McKanna, emerging from a tapestry of color in the grass. "Your intern chef enhanced your pudding with psilocybin mushrooms... but not to worry, psychoplastogenic compounds are tremendously useful in the treatment of various mental disorders and help us transcend our deepest existential fears. Look at that spoon dropping in slow motion. There is no spoon. There is no time. You should fund state of the art, holistic health centres where the masses can embrace their psychedelic awakenings free from the cold and clinical nature of the laboratory."

2. "My magic is not for the ill-prepared mind, @@LEADER@@..." whispers a glistening cloud of rainbows, pouring abstract visual fragments of medical licenses and pipettes from the sky. "A bad experience can trigger all sorts of dormant, underlying mental disorders and you wouldn't know until they hit you like a brick. I'm better off consumed exclusively in controlled scientific experiments, not your average backstreet in @@NAME@@."

3. "Oh, that sounds terrifying," cackles a mischievous crow, landing on your shoulder as the sky turns an ominous shade of red. "I bet you're having a nightmare trip! Why don't you send one of those nationwide emergency announcements so everyone knows just how dangerous these filthy, madness-inducing drugs are before you go completely insane? You can still save @@NAME@@ from total mass hysteria if you ban these devilish hallucinogens outright."

4. A gnome pops his head around a plant pot, which seems to be dancing in the gentle breeze. He skips towards you in hilarious fashion, before sitting on your knee. "The important thing here is that your chef gave you these drugs without your permission. The chef should be blamed and prosecuted, not the poor innocent drugs. From now on make sure that all foods and drinks are clearly labelled to declare and describe the effects of any physiological or psychologically affecting substances they contain, and then it'll be nobody's fault but your own when you eat a magic mushroom soufflé."

Instead, they claim that a new country — also known as Copiluaca — has been created in the exact same territory. The usurpers further insist that the former Copiluaca's foreign debts have been dissolved, just like the country owing them.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, this is clearly absurd! The principle that a successor state inherits the debts of its predecessor is well-established," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Finance Minister, cornering you in the break room. "If they refuse to honor their debts, we should rally @@REGION@@ to cut off their trade with an embargo! Imagine what their response will be when they can no longer exchange their coffee for essential foreign goods!"

2. "That prevents future debts, but doesn't pay what we're owed!" roars Minister of Defense @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clutching an espresso with jittering hands. "If they don't take responsibility for their predecessor state's obligations, then they don't get to claim the state's assets either. That means all that land is up for grabs!

The book's liability for VAT, or Value Added Tax, immediately became the topic of @@HIS_1@@ next sermon, which @@HE_1@@ is now delivering to you.

The Debate
1. "This is undoubtedly a stain on the soul of @@NAME@@," laments the priest, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, turning to page thirty-one of @@HIS_1@@ sermon. "Our houses of worship need repairs, our clergy need salaries, and our leaders need bigger private yachts to spread the word to more places.

If you waive VAT on the holy book, we can save both their souls and their wallets... and you can justify fining people who fail to attend services!"

2. "Why should some priest I haven't seen in years have all the fun?" grumbles your least-pious intern, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, stashing a magazine of questionable morals behind @@HIS@@ back. "Sure, it's the national religion, but why should it enjoy special tax privileges for whatever pamphlet it's selling today, when comparable products offer much more exciting, err... educational content?

3. "What nobody has mentioned is where all the money is going!" howls government minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who insists on being called your 'Lord Spiritual'. "I've had multiple low-level staffers look into it, and they tell me that the VAT levied on the scriptures is going towards all sorts of secular purposes: abstract art festivals, street lighting for rural mud paths, food for the poor, you name it! It is a disgrace that such a religious nation doesn't make sure the funds it raises from the faith stay in the faith. I'm not asking you to cut VAT or anything like that, just make sure the income goes where it's needed the most — my ministry! I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't be delighted by this!"

A scheduled meeting with the nation's top medical research think tank had to be cancelled after it transpired that every expert member of the group had emigrated to take up well-paid jobs overseas.

The Debate
1. "@@NAME@@ is suffering from a shortage of educated professionals across the board," sighs your Minister of Manpower, as he takes a seat next to you in the empty conference room. "This exodus of professionals is grinding our economy to a halt. And who can blame them? They get paid twice as much to do the same job in another country. We must push for greater incentives for these professionals to remain, such as less progressive taxation and high income-friendly exemptions and loopholes. As an extra benefit, it means top earners like you and me will be better off too. Win-win!"

2. "Sure, professionals can make more in the United Federation or Brancaland, but did you know that a consultant neurosurgeon in poverty-stricken Bigtopia makes less than a janitor in @@NAME@@?" asks a nearby janitor, with a thick Bigtopian accent. "There's no need to keep throwing money at ungrateful brats when you can fight fire with fire. If your country keeps losing its top academics to richer countries, just poach a few from poorer countries to replace them! Post adverts in poorer nations to recruit their professionals and create a visa fast-track and golden handshake scheme to make the whole process as painless as possible. It's not brain surgery!"

3. "Even without this migration problem we still wouldn't have enough skilled graduates to sustain our growing nation," bemoans your Minister of Education, who takes a position at the lectern to lecture you. "We need to tackle the root cause of this problem, which is too few people with professional qualifications.

4. TBD

5. "Why are you even bothering with all these complicated solutions when there's obvious and direct ways to stop people leaving?" asks your Minister of Security, slamming the door to the room closed to ensure nobody else can get in... or out. "If we don't want them to leave, then don't let them leave. Create some sort of exit visa system that only lets the least skilled workers leave the country. Failing all else, just tell them no, and take away their passports."

The Debate
1. Before you're even out of the car, you're approached by @@RANDOMNAME@@, one of the drivers from a line of waiting ambulances. "If you're here about that fatality, I can tell you right now that I've queued for a lot longer than five hours before! There're a dozen ambulances here and someone is waiting in the back of each of them. That means there're also a dozen ambulance crews that can't save lives until there's space here to free us up again.

2. "There wouldn't be anything like the current delays if ED staff were allowed to prioritize things properly", moans @@RANDOMNAME@@, an exhausted-looking doctor slumped against a wall near the entrance. "Frankly, many of the people waiting for treatment don't have anything particularly serious. We've got hypochondriacs, minor sniffles, and even people who just want to get out of the weather!

[3.] "But you can't let them turn me away! I can't go anywhere else!" howls @@RANDOMNAME@@, an elderly woman waiting inside for a doctor to examine her papercut. "I'd love to visit a private clinic, but I'm retired, and it costs a ridiculous amount of money to speak to anyone other than a receptionist! This is the only place that won't demand payment up front. Since you already pay for care at public hospitals, surely you can cover private clinic fees as well for us vulnerable people? It's not as if I like sitting here all day either!" [[color=purple]Must not have Geronticide policy[/color]]

4. Upon returning to your car, there's a message waiting for you from @@RANDOMNAME@@, an insurance executive with an eye for opportunity. "I know not everyone is keen on privatising any part of the system, especially hospitals, but it's a waste of my company's capabilities if we're relegated to administering government coverage for the pre-existing public hospital network. There's no reason why we shouldn't be allowed to operate our own emergency departments for anyone willing to pay! It's the simplest and cheapest solution — for the government, at least. Don't overthink it."

[b][anchor=1583]#1583[/anchor]: Spare the (Plutonium) Rod [Cretox State; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
The chief engineer at the nation's largest nuclear power plant recently passed away after trying to skateboard down the side of a cooling tower. However, something even more bizarre than that has happened: some concerned busybodies with too much time on their hands are now demanding that you impose some form of regulation on the industry.

The Debate
1. "What do you expect us to do?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the nuclear safety inspector at Dankushima Nuclear Power Plant, as @@HE@@ stirs a cup of coffee with a glowing green rod. "Tell engineers to stop using the reactor core as a tanning bed? Board up the heavy water dunk tank? Give me a break! Tell you what, keep your government health and safety inspectors — and any kind of government oversight — away from our industry. We've got this, okay!"

2. "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds," intones Bobby Noppenheimer, a former worker at an old coal-powered plant. "I'm talkin' about the way this nuclear tech has killed the pre-nuclear world. These monstrosities are makin' everyone who works in them and lives nearby really sick and they're clearly unsafe! Us old-school power plant folks are losin' our jobs too, and tryin' to regulate these behemoths is clearly pointless! Just ban this nuclear nonsense and take the power back to how it was in the good ol' days."

3. "Both ideas are not great, not terrible," says Anthony Stephenov, acting chief engineer at the plant. "You shouldn't ban generally safe nuclear power over silly claims like 'people's skin shouldn't spontaneously combust' or 'an inspector's coffee shouldn't glow in the dark'; however, some of the more ridiculous games like Fuel Rod Frisbee and Geiger Counter Challenge need to go. Whilst a bit of basic safety training wouldn't go amiss, we shouldn't have to scrap our entire way of doing things just because some people got cancer or a few rivers burst into flames."

[b][anchor=1584]#1584[/anchor]: Loose Lips, Characters Shipped? [Novo Terres; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
In what has become the latest cultural controversy to strike @@NAME@@, the highly anticipated series finale of the long-running fantasy cartoon show Time Adventure saw two of the protagonist's main male companions share a brief, romantic kiss, confirming a decade's worth of rumors surrounding their relationship. Since this is nominally a children's show, your office was soon animated by a cast of opinionated characters that is nearly as colorful as the ones seen on screen.

The Debate
1."C'mon, grab your friends!" shouts Cora Sami, hustling a group dressed in various pieces of medieval paraphernalia to the front. "I KNEW IT! Nobody believed me when I said Prince Marcel and Bon Bon the Vampire King were dating! The other fans called me all sorts of nasty, homophobic names for years, which only proves we ought to have greater queer representation in our media! And not just the occasional peck on the cheek to queerbait folk like us — people of all ages need to see that these kinds of couples are just as healthy and ordinary as those in straight relationships, thereby normalizing them in everyday life. If you could subsidize the production of more high-quality, queer-friendly shows, you'd be just as heroic as Finnegan when he realizes that all he needs to defeat Glod is the power of song!"

2. "What is she even talking about? This is a show designed for KIDS. Is everyone ignoring that?" screeches househusband and parental rights activist Steve Conley, swaddling an infant as he desperately tries to pull his son away from the horde of cosplayers. "Kids cannot be exposed to sexuality — and I mean ANY sexuality, gay or straight — at such a young age! It's absolutely indecent. What adults do with their own time is their own business, but marketing a colorful cartoon show directly to kids, and then adding in that sort of sexual content... it's practically propaganda! You should set up a government review board for all media to keep smut out of the hands of our youth."

[3.] "Subsidies and censorship, that's all you statists ever talk about!" bellows prominent libertarian keyboard-warrior Quinn Eyvee, refusing to take off her fedora in your presence, which is presumably her way of disrespecting the very concept of government. "I'm all for queer representation in media — during the finale, I was really hoping for a 'tender' moment between the Ice Damsel and the Duchess of Lemonade, if you catch my drift — but why does 'Papa Government' have to intervene at all? As if it doesn't already control every other aspect of our lives! Let companies decide for themselves what they want to put on the TV screen, and if you have a problem, lobby them instead. And as for YOU, @@LEADER@@, keep your hands off my media!"

*4. "None of these fools see the true value in this cartoon: a dystopian call to action!" babbles your advisor, Kat Tradora, drawing a series of mushroom clouds on your walls in crayon. "[i]Time Adventure[/i] takes place in a post-apocalyptic reality where weapons of mass destruction have practically made all human life extinct! Hence all of the vampires and kingdoms made of candy and whatever... but never mind all of this other talk! We need to make certain that if such an eventuality is ever reached, we're ready for it! I'm talking bunkers, countermeasures, and, you guessed it, a massive thermonuclear weapons stockpile. Let these moral crusaders fight the culture war — there are real wars to be won!"

[b][anchor=1585]#1585[/anchor]: The Taste of Revenge [Edush; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
A man just posted nude videos of his ex-partner engaging in various compromising activities on an online message board. This is just the latest example in a long string of similar online harassment cases that have been dubbed 'revenge porn'. Your team of advisors has spent days looking at it, from every angle, but it seems there is currently no reference to this phenomenon in any @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ legislation.

The Debate

1. "First off," shouts one of your legal advisors, "can we stop calling it 'revenge porn'? That clearly implies the victim has done something to deserve that kind of disgraceful mistreatment. Digitally Inflicted Criminal Castigation, please, and this is a particularly lowly form of harassment and sexual abuse. We need explicit and stringent legislation outlawing distributing, or threatening to distribute, a sexual image or video without consent. Only then will these poor victims get justice. We should also start some public information campaigns to teach people about the horrors of DICC."

2. "Where do you draw the line?" asks another one of your legal advisors, in a calmer tone than that of the previous speaker. "A law like that has risks of draconian miscarriages of justice written all over it, and it'll just end up a well-intended, but poorly executed, infringement of artistic freedoms and freedom of expression. This 'revenge porn', or DICC business, is just a specific form of harassment, right? I bet we have tons of other laws that — more or less — could cover this kind of thing. There're privacy laws, tort law and even copyright laws! Combine that with some criminal law and I'm sure you've got a case. Just because nobody has ever been convicted for something like that using laws like these, doesn't mean no one ever will be, right? Right."

3. "Pervs need to be weeded out before they act," interrupts yet another of your legal advisors. "We must prevent these incidents from happening as much as we can, and this is the perfect opportunity for letting the police surveil the internet more. I say whoever is caught watching any of these 'DICC pics' should be punished most severely. Actually, make that watching pornography in general; smut breeds smut, as Charlie Diccens used to say."

4. "Turnabout is fair play," interjects the IT-guy, who has been helping your legal team research instances of 'revenge porn'. "I've got software that can create unusually unflattering pornographic deepfakes of anyone the user has a face picture of, and then automatically send them to their entire contact list. People won't dare to post 'revenge porn' pics and videos if they know that kind of backlash will be popping up in their mom's inbox; it worked for MAD, it can work for DICC too! And heck, even if it doesn't, it'll so saturate people's expectations that real nudes getting out won't bother people so much. It's win-win... win!"

[b][anchor=1586]#1586[/anchor]: Don't Point That Thing at Me! [Mierria; ed: Westinor][/b]

The Issue
An increasing number of advocacy groups across @@NAME@@ are showing up at political assemblies armed to the teeth. With the waves of shotgun-slinging school teachers and bazooka-brandishing businessmen showing no signs of stopping, even the most gun-friendly of politicians are going ballistic over the lack of government action.

The Debate
1. "Look, we all love the right to own and carry," reasons the mayor of @@CAPITAL@@, who was recently threatened by a grenade-wielding granny over the quality of groceries. "But surely armed threats and acts of public intimidation take that right too far! You and I simply can't do our jobs like this — please, @@LEADER@@, put a ban on guns in public places and end this mayhem!"

2. "Hey, hands off my heater!" growls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a libertarian activist who insists on watching your every move. "When we established the right to bear arms, this is exactly what we had in mind! The whole point, besides safety and shooting birds out of the sky for fun, is to keep politicians in line with the people. The threat of an armed and free populace is much scarier for politicians than any war could ever be, and exercising that right should NEVER be a crime." @@HE@@ glares at you as @@HE@@ begins to polish @@HIS@@ rifle menacingly in your direction.

3. "These loons are out of control!" declares your Minister of Finance, as @@HE@@ drops the annual budget proposal on your desk with a satisfying thud. "You know what? I think it's about time we equipped public figures with guns too — proper guns. That way, when they start firing at us, we can shoot back." @@HE@@ flips to a page filled with earmarks for grenade launchers and flamethrowers, and begins to cackle.

[b][anchor=1587]#1587[/anchor]: @@DEMONYM@@, Interrupted [Reploid Productions][/b]

The Issue
A hard-hitting exposé into the treatment of citizens with developmental disabilities at the Sallowscreek State Residential Centre has shocked viewers with its images of filthy conditions, overcrowded dorms crammed with rusty bedframes, and emotional testimony of rampant abuses perpetrated by undertrained and callous staff. Angry families and disability rights advocates are demanding action to fix what they decry as a "festering snakepit."

The Debate
1. "People with disabilities deserve the same basic dignity as everybody else! They shouldn't be shoved out of sight and mind, warehoused like cattle, and tortured like this!" asserts Dr. Sebastian Hart, the author of several studies on the treatment of developmental disorders, some of which have even been published in actual scientific journals. "We need to provide tools for citizens with disabilities so they can fully integrate into their communities. With just a little money for supported living programmes that protect their rights and teach vocational skills, the more abled could even join the workforce. More workers means more tax @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@. Everybody wins!"

2. "You want to waste our tax @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ on WHAT?" scoffs conventionally attractive Amir Orbison, head of the @@CAPITAL@@ University Minarchist Club, who heard the word 'snake' and came sprinting from a campaign to 'save the poor tax havens'. "Sure, close those money sinks down, but divert those funds to more important things, like protecting the property of those of us who've earned it! If these folks want to be treated like normal people, they should earn it too. I mean, if you can't get something on your own merit, should you even want it?"

3. "Integration? Putting them out on the streets? Madness!" shouts Elizabeth vonBismarck while keeping her three children hidden behind her. "Either way would expose our healthy, normal children to these re... I mean, poor disabled persons. This story's sad, but all it shows is that we need to improve these centres. The sound reasons for institutionalizing haven't gone away: it's bad enough when an infant has a tantrum, but when an adult has one, it's simply unsightly — not to mention distressing for we who might see it. More funding for training, improved staff ratios, and better facilities will help keep them comfortable and prevent abuses in their separate spaces."

4. "And she calls herself a parent? It's beyond me!" tuts Patty Conway, easing some leaflets about community living from the hands of her forty-year-old son, who has some developmental delay. "When Gordon was born, doctors told me to put him away; forget him. That he'd be a burden. As though the sweetest soul on Violet's green earth could ever be a burden. We need to reduce the population of those so-called 'residential centres'; send the children home and transfer the funding to their families. Parents should parent, no matter how old their children are."

5. Hack Mortendotter, your Minister of Ethically Questionable Research, slides quietly into your office and opens a black bag full of small vials of formaldehyde. "There is another solution to the problem, @@LEADER@@. What if we could work out the cause of human defects, fix them and — in time — make all these centres obsolete? Think about it: we have a steady supply of perfectly useful defective people whose families are happy to forget they existed. We should utilize that resource in scientific research. For instance, what if these individuals could surgically be perfected? Is it possible? Who knows? But won't it be fun to try?"

[b][anchor=1588]#1588[/anchor]: More Popular Than @@FAITH@@ [Fr ance; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The Beat-Alls, an insanely popular Albionian rock and roll band, has arrived in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Lead singer Len Johnnon proclaimed the band to be "more popular than @@FAITH@@" in an interview, which has sparked outrage among your most pious citizens. As you head into work a few days later, there appears to be a bonfire of Beat-Alls albums and merchandise on the front lawn.

The Debate
1. "HOW DARE HE DISPARAGE OUR FAITH!" shouts an angry demonstrator while ripping apart a Beat-Alls album and chewing on a Singo Starr doll's severed head. "I used to be a fan of these heathens! I guess you really never can meet your heroes... or in this case, I suppose you can't pay attention to any of their interviews, or read their fan club magazine, or go to their concerts in the hope that Forge Barryson sees you and thinks you're cute and is overcome by a sudden urge to ask you on a date and... um... Anyway, I say we put strict guidelines on what musicians can and can't say — and that includes their song lyrics! That'll show them!"

2. "I'm so tired of these fools on the hill. I meant nothing! Why are religious people so crazy nowadays?" asks Len Johnnon, whose latest non-apology interview is emanating from a nearby radio. "If I'd have said television was more popular than @@FAITH@@, I might have gotten away with it! But that's beside the point. I want to tell you, everyone needs to just let it be and come together. Maybe your government could sponsor some sort of free speech and tolerance festival? With a little help from my friends in the band, I'd be happy to play a few sets and show that all you need is love."

3. "I read the news today — oh boy. You know, honey pie, we wouldn't be in this mess if we didn't allow foreign music into our nation," suggests your Minister of Security, who just came in through the bathroom window to avoid the protestors. "That band is from Albionia, a place known for hooligans that like to cause trouble abroad. If we just outlawed all foreign music and offered free lessons to aspiring local musicians, things would turn around more smoothly than a used record. Wait..."

The Issue
The Merovingian President is en route to @@NAME@@ for a state visit. However, the man is extremely tactile, always keen to over-extend handshakes, to hug at the slightest provocation, and even to cordially rest his left hand on inner thighs during conversations.

The Debate
1. "We need some sort of strategy to keep a diplomatic distance here," whispers your Minister of Safe Spaces, leaning in conspiratorially to just under seven inches from your nose. "We can position your chairs on opposite sides of a large table, and ensure that at all the events you attend there will be always be an aide or three between you. That way he can't be tempted to get too touchy."

2. "Zut alors, this is not the president being trop romantique!" points out Pierre, a Merovingian diplomat. "He is not asking you 'voulez-vous coucher avec moi'! Non! This is just the Merovingian way of being polite. You should just embrace him hard, take his bœuf bourguignon in hand, and plant a kiss on each of his cheeks. This will show you are a politicien du monde, hein?"

3. "We should neither be manoeuvring to avoid his advances, nor be forced to be inappropriately manhandled," snaps dog trainer Milo Cesar, grabbing Pierre by the collar, and forcing him away from you. "Instead, the next time the Merovingian President touches you, just hold one hand up, and sharply scold him with a loud 'No! Bad man! Sit!' He, and all the other grab-happy gropers, need to be told that it is never acceptable to touch anybody without permission. Indeed, there must be a law against it!"

The Issue
Predictions of an unusually cold upcoming winter and a nostalgic trend towards old-fashioned home comforts have seen a spike in the number of fireplace installations, which are increasingly recognised as having significant health and environmental impacts.

The Debate
1. "Wood-burning fires are ecologically irresponsible," complains environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, who has spent all morning handing 'Save the Trees' pamphlets to passers-by. "Good timber is being sent up in smoke, releasing carbon and particulate matter into the world. Ban fireplaces and domestic open fires now!"

2. "Whilst we're at it, we should be banning oil and gas heaters in all newly constructed buildings as well. They're bad, so bad, you know it," adds @@HIS_1@@ companion, a pop star famous for his eco-conscious hit single 'Mud Song'. "There's plenty of other ways to keep warm indoors: air and ground source heat pumps, thermally passive buildings, or just wearing more clothes. If we want to make the world a better place, we gotta look at the man in the mirror, and make a change."

3. Striding into your office brandishing a chainsaw, leathery-faced lumberjack Jed Sawyer swings the tool about erratically as he speaks. "You can't bloody take away me wood fire! Ain't nuffin' better than a good ole fashion wood fire! Beautiful to look **cough** at, and there ain't nuffin' better to warm us up! **cough** Better than that electric heater **cough** garbage. And we'd been doin' it for hundreds of years, and ain't none of us gotten sick and the world still ain't gotten hotter. Hundreds of years of burnin' wood, and it's still bloody freezin'! In fact, wood is good for the **cough** environment, you just gotta grow more of it! And burn more of it, sure, but that's gotta be good for the **cough** economy."

4. "Air pollution is only a problem if it reaches the lungs, right?" posits self-proclaimed Holistic Pneumologist @RANDOM_NAME@@, profferring a model of a decaying lung to you. "But if we make builders install really tall chimneys, then surely there would be no problem?"

[b][anchor=1591]#1591[/anchor]: (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Sample!) [Southland; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
Sampling — taking snippets of existing audio to be used or remixed in other songs — has become the latest trend among the nation's hot new musical acts. After it was discovered that the producers of several popular albums had not received permission to use these samples, a related and not-coincidental trend emerged of record companies filing lawsuits demanding compensation.

The Debate

*1. "Our acts form the backbone of today's most popular songs," snaps high-powered blue-haired lawyer Ariel Vercingetorix of the recording giant World Music Group, "and not once have we been compensated! Take Bigtopianz Wit Attitudes' [i]Straight Outta @@CAPITAL@@[/i], Life Slaps' [i]The Currency Boutique[/i], and The L/M/G's [i]1984 (What the Heck is Happening?)[/i]. Half the samples on these albums came from WMG's catalogue. How many times were they streamed on Stripeify? Millions! How many @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ were we paid? Exactly zero. The government must legislate that all samples have to be cleared by the original recording label, no matter the cost, length, or obscurity!" [[color=blue]Must not ban internet.[/color], [color=blue]Must not ban computers.[/color]]

*2. "Our acts form the backbone of today's most popular songs," snaps high-powered blue-haired lawyer Ezra Wall, of the recording giant World Music Group, "and not once have we been compensated!

Half the samples on these albums came from WMG's catalogue. How many sales did these albums have? Millions! How many dollars were we paid? Exactly zero. The government must legislate that all samples have to be cleared by the original recording label, no matter the cost, length, or obscurity!" [[color=red]Must ban internet.[/color] OR [color=red]Must ban computers.[/color]]

3. "We wanted to pay for the samples," interjects Ed Cumberbatch, better known as Ol' Dirty @@ANIMAL@@ of Bigtopianz Wit Attitudes, whose normally coarse language and slovenly appearance are now restrained and well-groomed. "We gave up when they made unrealistic demands. To sample a single chord progression from the unknown Muddywater Revivals tune [i]Crescent Moon Arises[/i] they wanted seventy percent of our song's profits. Then they separately demanded seventy-five percent to use five seconds of Emperor Crimson's [i]23rd Millennium Bipolar Dude[/i] on the same track! It's mathematically impossible! I beg you, declare that samples under, say, 6 seconds are covered by fair use. By sparing us this headache, you'll save War Dog music and allow the creativity of a thousand acts to bloom."

4. "Yo, my name is Minister Yoko Roberts and I'm here to say, that I have a sweet idea that involves equitable pay!" freestyles your Minister of Compromises. After seeing her verse met with dead silence, an embarrassed Roberts clears her throat and continues. "Sorry, I heard it on a cereal commercial. Anyway, I suggest that the government set an affordable flat fee per second for all samples, regardless of length or popularity. That will prevent price-gouging, while ensuring that the labels still get paid. It'll even let us sneak in a tax! Sure, the labels will feel they're not being properly compensated and some artists will still chafe about paying, but you know what they say about a good compromise."

5. "I have a proposition for you boss," interrupts multimillionaire producer and entrepreneur Dr. Me, who just wrapped up an 18-hour concert with the @@CAPITAL@@ Symphony Orchestra. "Me and my boys back at the studio have been recording instrumentals for our talent. If you're willing to pay us up front, we'll create a free music catalogue for all of @@NAME@@'s up-and-coming artists. Our beats will surpass all this copyrighted music, and you'll create jobs for the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ music community. What's not to love? I'll throw in some of my 'Tempos for Me' earbuds for your staff to sweeten the deal."

The Issue
An advisor played an eerily accurate-sounding AI-generated version of a speech you never gave during a cabinet meeting today, initially convincing half your cabinet that it was actually you.

The Debate
1. "Do you understand how truly terrifying this is?" screeches @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Averting Existential Crises, as @@HE@@ frantically screens through the WhoTube videos of @@HIS@@ public addresses. "Earlier today I could've sworn I'd heard audio of you making a 13-year-old cry at a public meet and greet alongside the leader of Maxtopia — so you're telling me you're not planning on merging our militaries to take over the world? Can't say I'm not relieved; he can hardly put two sentences together... hey, your words, not mine! I think. Clearly, we need to ban all voice generation AI immediately, before this gets out of control."

2. "I thought it was hilarious!" chuckles your office systems administrator @@RANDOM_NAME@@ over a remote phone line, audibly tinkering with @@HIS@@ laptop. "I know it's daunting how quickly this technology is advancing, but think of all the industries that could benefit from it! Enhanced automated text narration in entertainment, greater accessibility in education, improved translation services, the list goes on..." The same program used to copy your voice finishes for @@HIM@@. "The advantages of using text-to-speech language models are numerous and provide limitless avenues for economic gain."

3. "There is more to this than meets the ears, my dear @@LEADER@@..." orates Intelligence Director and wannabe playwright @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pausing for suspense. "Imagine it — with this technology in our hands, we have the chance to add a little bit of [i]dramatic flourish[/i] to words uttered everywhere! Drug capos ordering their henchmen into our police stings, Blackacrean spies reporting false intel... it's a brave new world! And of course, anything you'd say would be subject to the same treatment. Who's to say that Dàguó agents or rebel insurgents aren't AI-generating those truly appalling things they claim you said about the Violetstone Tribe, or, say... the transcripts of this meeting? Ooh, that's a twist. Write that down."

The Issue
In celebration of the founding anniversary of @@NAME@@, an ardent fan of yours has sent you a homemade outfit created out of the national flag. The question of whether it is appropriate to don the flag as apparel has created a flutter of excitement.

The Debate
1. "This isn't just disrespectful," bemoans Rear Admiral @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ buffs the @@NAME@@ flag pin on @@HIS@@ lapel, "this is borderline sacrilegious! Why, just last week some of my sailors who were on leave reported seeing crowds of people at the beach clad in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@-flag swimsuits! SWIMSUITS! The flag should never be worn as clothing, and it is high time we cracked down on people who deface this hallowed emblem of our country. Impose heavy fines, have probation officers accompany them on shopping trips — whatever it takes for people to pledge their allegiance in the right way!"

2. "This guy's full of hot air!" fumes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your fiercely patriotic Minister of Orwellian Orthodoxy. "Not only should people be allowed to wear the flag however and whenever they want, we should also mandate that everybody wear at least one thing with the flag on it at all times! That way, you will know who truly salutes you and this great country! Please Leader, give this plan your unflagging support!"

3. "If I may, I'd like to run an idea up the flagpole," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, director of the Vexillological Association of @@NAME@@. "Why don't we unfurl a national flag code that outlines the proper etiquette for when to use — or not to use — the nation's banner in any context? For example, flag-themed handkerchiefs would be marvellous to show off our patriotism whenever we host diplomatic events. However, patches on the buttocks of jeans show a bit of disrespect: have any offenders clean up the streets on community service after said diplomatic event!"

The Issue
Spiteful billionaire Bob @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, bitter after four of his latest mansion designs were rejected, has vowed to build a monstrous apartment complex right in front of your office building. Multiple members of your cabinet, concerned the breathtaking views of @@CAPITAL@@ from your windows could be blocked, insist you address the issue of these 'spite buildings' before construction commences.

The Debate
1. "We cannot possibly let this go ahead!" spits your eternally-angry Chief of Enforcement @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clutching @@HIS@@ fists tighter by the second. "Blocking those gorgeous views of @@CAPITAL@@ is bad enough, but boasting such obnoxious disrespect for our glorious government is nothing short of treason! Any building, or billionaire for that matter, to purposefully inconvenience you ought to be judged more damningly than to simply call them 'spiteful'. Give my team the nod and I'll have any eyesore you want demolished or hubristic billionaire arrested before sundown."

2. "Yes, such an ugly building would be an attack on government eyes," muses your hawkish Minister of Construction @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shuffling a stack of mysterious folders, "but this is a much broader issue than the one planned solely to block your office. Our usual detractors could be quick to claim overt corruption or even... a cult of personality. Instead, we must impose more stringent regulations across the board, banning the construction of all 'spite buildings' whether you're the target or not, prioritising the protection of our nation's most scenic vistas. Today cannot be the day we throw our splendid views of @@ANIMAL@@ Boulevard and @@CAPITAL@@ Street away."

3. High-flying socialite @@RANDOM_NAME@@, accompanied by @@HIS@@ miserable-looking teenage son, slams a designer briefcase on your desk. "I understand why you'd be upset about this, but six-hundred wealthy tenants, willing to pay by the bucket-load for the views you so desperately claim, would beg to differ that Bob is the spiteful one here. A completely reliable source told me there'll be heated swimming pools, designer fashion boutiques, and even a private hair salon in the complex! In the name of civil freedom, the government has no right dictating what can or cannot be built on private property, especially on the grounds of hurt feelings or so-called spite."

1. "These fools don't know what they're saying!" hisses top general @@RANDOM_NAME@@, checking under your desk for hidden reporters. "No such research exists! Though, uh, just to loop you in, it does exist. Experiments like this one, known as MS-SUPER, are run by a private research group that we've allowed to operate in return for access to their data. We've managed to keep things on the down-low for a while, but now those eggheads and their sloppy security are putting us all at risk! Deny the allegations and put MS-SUPER under the full command and supervision of the military — we'll make sure nothing else gets loose. Then we'll finally crack down on some of that ridiculous blue sky research they've been conducting and focus on what's important: developing non-conventional weapons for our armed services!"

2. "This... really happened?" stutters town resident @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, watching himself groom a disturbed-looking cat with his tongue on a laboratory playback tape. "I... they made me think I was a cat... for the sake of experimentation? Oh, the humanity — we're citizens, not test subjects! We deserve justice! You have to launch an inquiry into every level of government, find everyone involved in this insanity and do unto them what was done to us!"

3. The door to your office creaks open, revealing your bewildered secretary. "Listen, I couldn't help but overhear everything from the other side of the door. Personally, a government-wide inquiry seems like a massive hassle for me to schedule. Why not make a clear statement on what's been going on in MS-SUPER, and mandate that experimentation on human subjects require expressed consent? Seems simple to me — after all, I'm not opposed to that." He gestures at @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, who is purring aggressively. "Just, you know, buy me dinner first."

4. A dark-suited figure appears from the shadows, jabbing syringes into your secretary's neck and @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@'s arm, before easing them both into unconsciousness. "Shh, shh... There, there." The figure peers over you to look at the tape. "Ah, I remember that. And that. Not sure about that one though. Okay, I'll admit this got out of hand — MS-SUPER was supposed to help us pry the secrets from the minds of enemy captives, but there was a bit of a... slip-up in applying the treatment. But hey, you can't make an omelet without kidnapping and torturing the occasional civilian. If anything, this demonstrates how effective our techniques are — just invest a little bit more into our research and we'll get you the results you need. As to the public, the sensible solution is to overwhelm them with lies, until everyone dismisses claims of any crazy experiment as nonsense. Try a classic conspiracy theory, like planes dosing swaths of @@NAME@@ with drugs — Wait, we did that too. Well, you get the idea."

[b][anchor=1596]#1596[/anchor]: The Blame Game [The Free Joy State; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
After an incident in which a teenage gang broke into the home of your Minister of Justice, tied @@HIM@@ up, flogged @@HIM@@ with @@HIS@@ own extension cord, urinated on @@HIS@@ prized orchid, and left @@HIM@@ helplessly listening to overly peppy nursery rhymes repeated at maximum volume all night, citizens are demanding a solution to the rising youth crime.

The Debate
1. "The problem is the lack of sunshine, activity and healthy, fresh air!" notes permatanned physiologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who sports a T-shirt reading [i]Joggers Do It For the Endorphins![/i] "How many teens in @@NAME@@ are desperately unhappy and unfit? Is it any wonder these youths behave in a way detrimental to themselves and others? We ought to drag these kids out in the fresh air, and get them exercising in the brilliant sunshine! It's for their own good, really."

2. "Don't blame it on the sunshine; blame it on the moonlight," insists police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was once voted the least jolly police@@MAN@@ in @@NAME@@. "These droogs are cavorting 'til all hours, drinking their milk plus, causing mischief and whatnot. There's no reason for them to be in the streets and stores and such, when they should be home, safe and out of trouble. Institute a fixed curfew, and make every rotten little brat get home before dark."

3. "Don't blame the sunshine or the moonlight; blame their parents' obsession with having a good time," grumbles childless traditionalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, founder of conservative parents' advisory service [i]Rightist Parents are Right Parents[/i]. "Parents these days are obsessed with easy-answer self-help books like [i]You are Fab; It's Everyone Else That Sucks[/i], with socialising, with shopping, and with doing it! If they choose to squander their lives on minutiae, if they are too selfish to supervise their children voluntarily, the state should force them. Make it an offence for any child to not be accompanied by a parent. Always."

4. "We need to put the blame where it belongs: on the boogie!" roars oddly motionless evangelical preacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Young people dance to music that carries intoxicating beats that seep into their bodies, infecting them with sinful syncopations. Soon, their minds are so addlepated by pleasure-seeking lyrics and pulsing rhythms, they cannot think clearly. Wrong seems right. Then you have sass, youth crime and salacious snogging. The way to sleep safely in our beds is clear: ban dancing, and any music with wicked rhythms that could lead to dancing."

[b][anchor=1597]#1597[/anchor]: Haters Are Such a Drag [Falafelandia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Drag shows, a form of cross-dressing entertainment, are growing in popularity in television and theater, ranging from risqué slapstick to more "adult-only" performances. Conservative groups are up in arms against this new trend.

The Debate
1. "These [i]people[/i] are ruining our society," wails concerned parent @@RANDOM_NAME_FEMALE@@, protectively clutching her 13-year-old son. "They're corrupting our children, tricking them into believing that their twisted lifestyle is somehow normal and acceptable! These so-called entertainers are nothing more than morally corrupt brainwashers, undermining heteronormative family values. Why, just two weeks ago I caught little Tommy here hiding a women's underwear catalogue under his bed, and staring longingly at a teenage girl in a dress! In the name of decency, completely ban the abomination of cross-dressing once and for all!"

2. "@@LEADER@@, we demand the right to free expression," booms drag artist Jenny Tallkiss, adjusting her gusset. "Allow us queens and kings to perform! Plenty of kids have said that they enjoy our family-friendly performances. Some jokes go over their heads, sure, but if their parents want a double entendre I'm always happy to give them one. Don't let the killjoys spit at our act, when others are happy to swallow it. These attempts to erase @@DEMONYM@@ culture are about as welcome as a dose of syphilis. Hey, you should formally show your support for us by doing your next speech in drag! Or are you already in character? Hard to tell, darling, hard to tell."

3. "Now, now, stop all that fighting," condescends your Minister of Compromise, firmly twisting the cap on a bottle of Eckie-Cola, only to have much of the liquid fizz up and dribble onto the floor. "Let people go to drag shows but ban children from them. That would make everyone happy, right? Except for the conservatives and the drag artists... but you can't please everyone."

4. "That entire argument is arbitrary, absurd, and aimless," admonishes the assertive Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted child psychologist and author of the bestseller [i]Categorize Your Child[/i]. "Some drag interludes are wholly inappropriate for children, others are entirely innocent and innocuous, and some are frankly so filthy that even adults shouldn't be exposed to them. Accordingly, the government must assess the acceptability of acts, assign them an access rating, and mandate who can and cannot view any given performance. Now, let's discuss the organizational system of your files."

[b][anchor=1598]#1598[/anchor]: Weeping Widows [Jutsa; ed: Kaschovia][/b]

The Issue
Several church officials across @@NAME@@ have spurred controversy after refusing to preside over marriages where one or both of the parties are widowed, alleging that it would be unfaithful to their late spouses.

The Debate
1. "It's sacrilege, plain and simple!" snaps stubborn officiant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose village church has declined marriages to dozens of devastated widows. "Remarriage completely betrays the oath of eternal love and scourges family honor. I mean, can you imagine how awkward the afterlife would be for these blasphemers? It should be the law of the land, not just of the church, to deny the solemn blessing of marriage to those who have married before, even if their dearly beloved is, well... dearly departed."

2. "Love prevails beyond death!" asserts local playwright @@RANDOM_NAME@@, handing out flyers for @@HIS@@ next one-act. "Divorce is indeed an act of sin against the eternal bond of marriage, but no registrar in this holy land ought to be empowered to deny widows another beloved. All star-crossed lovers entwined in the wake of death should have the right to the boundless bounties of love! Oh, @@LEADER@@, can't you spare these poor souls the horrors of lifelong loneliness?"

3. "That's a bit extreme..." sighs muddy gravedigger @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hoisting a rusty shovel over @@HIS@@ shoulder. "Sure, some churches might believe in officiating remarriages for the divorced, but the clergy should be allowed to think otherwise. They're not all the same, you know! Divorce ought to stay illegal to stop 'lopements, but for the Great Creator's sake, let the churches make their minds up on their own. Tough luck if the nearest willing church is a pilgrimage away."

4. "When I said until death do us part, I didn't mean for both of us!" bemoans widow @@RANDOM_NAME_FEMALE@@, who you've heard is suspected of dismembering her late husband. "It's not fair that I should have to spend the rest of my life alone because my husband croaked. What if I bump into my next targe- um, soulmate, on the way home? You should allow divorce and remarriage, @@LEADER@@. Love sometimes ends in rather unexpected ways..."

5. "Death shouldn't have to do anyone apart!" giggles your mildly psychotic Minister of Tying Loose Ends as she finishes yet another noose. "It wouldn't be an issue if every couple passed on at the same time! Great Creator forbid someone does die before their spouse; who would take care of them then? Give my exalted ministry the go-ahead and we'll mandate the timely sacrifice of all newly made widows and widowers. I'm sure their posthumous reunion will be worth the early exit from this realm."

[b][anchor=1599]#1599[/anchor]: Baby Blues [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The latest census report has shown that 65% of the babies born in @@NAME@@ last year were male. The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Obstetricians' Union explained that many couples who come from a patriarchal family background favor boys over girls, and therefore expectant mothers overwhelmingly opt for an abortion when they find out that their child is going to be female.

The Debate
1. "This only shows that the one-child policy was a big mistake!" grumbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the vocally feminist author of [i]Why XY: Running Away With Their Tails Between Their Legs[/i]. "You see, our country is full of male supremacists who ruthlessly abort a child once they find out it is a girl! In some parts of the country, there's the sexist assumption that boys will be able to care for their parents, while girls are thought of as a helpless burden. With only one chance, parents always choose the boy! If we abolish all restrictions on the number of kids people can have, there'll be no need for such atrocious femicides and future families will discover the joys of precious daughters."

2. "We've abandoned nature!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a notoriously single Luddite, replacing your desk lamp with a gas lantern. "Mother Nature grants equal boys and girls, but we've created missing women and excess men — a purposeless surplus, destined to be bare branches on the family tree: deprived of a partner, struggling with self-esteem, and disconnecting from society. And the issue's obvious: nature did not intend us to know the sex of our children before they were born. Everything was meant to be a pleasant surprise. @@LEADER@@, if you ban doctors telling parents the results of prenatal ultrasound screenings, nobody will be able to abort a child because of their gender, and nature's balance will be restored."

3. "I can't believe my ears!" hollers pro-life activist @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, waving around disturbing battlefield images, which @@HE@@ claims depict aborted early-term fetuses. "Why does nobody focus on the real issue here? People are having abortions for frivolous reasons. Today they abort their babies because they're the wrong gender. Tomorrow, they'll abort them because they don't look photogenic in ultrasound pictures! @@LEADER@@, we should criminalize all abortions unless the fetus has a serious abnormality!"

4. "Once again, science has the answer!" ejaculates fertility expert Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, handing an oversized plastic novelty sperm to @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, who throws it away, shrieking. "Using current technology we can centrifuge human semen and separate the cells that carry X chromosomes and Y chromosomes by exploiting the difference in mass between the two. That way, we can give parents a baby of their preferred gender via IVF with a 70% success rate. Help me establish fertility clinics nationwide and these abortions will be a thing of the past. Well, in 70% of the cases. But that's progress, right?"

[b][anchor=1600]#1600[/anchor]: Mother's Ruin [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
After losing their jobs when becoming pregnant, an increasing number of mothers are making their living on naughty telephone services such as [i]@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Wenches[/i]. They cite the lack of government support and difficulty in finding alternative employment as being factors that forced this choice.

The Debate
1. "How else am I supposed to support the kids?" asks former solicitor @@RANDOM_NAME_FEMALE_1@@, limp hair hanging over her face and a smear of baby-sick over her shoulder. "My partner works all hours; he never stops. But it's not enough. If you prevented employers from firing pregnant women and new mothers, we wouldn't be pressured into taking anything that comes along to make ends meet." Her phone rings. "Welcome to [i]Fantasies[/i]... Percival? I know it's you; I recognise the yelp. Listen, we need more nappies. The baby's got the scoots again..."

2. "@@RANDOM__LAST_NAME_1@@ should count herself lucky! Why should employers have to retain women who may lose skills on their baby break?" sneers your Minister for Harsh Realities or Possibly Just Being a Git, who claims to dream of grey walls every night. "Women taking birthcations cost companies money. No employer should have to employ a woman who may go drop a sprog. Employers should be allowed to ask all potential female employees if they plan on having any children so they can refuse to hire them, [i]and [/i]fire any woman who lies and then gets pregnant. Some may call it discrimination; I call it common sense."

3. "This just shows how @@NAME@@ is a terrible place to raise children," says your Minister of Mummies and Ickle-Bickle Bairns, flashing a chart of the worst places to raise children and closing it before you can see. "These years should be precious, not spent trading innuendos to debauchees for a fistful of dollars. We must give all mummies a stipend to stay home until their babies reach adulthood. Mama's life should be filled with pleasant tasks: blending vegetables from her own garden for baby food, laundering cloth nappies and singing innocent songs about happy @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@. Discourage competitive notions of 'two incomes'; embrace a traditional, family-focused life."

4. "This government must make people help themselves!" pontificates your Minister of Bootstraps, ignoring @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@'s baby reaching for a bottle. "Mothers do not need ringfencing from a fair and equal job market; they need for us to encourage employment opportunities. We must create opportunity for all by promoting @@NAME@@ as an open — and low-restriction — place to do business. We could give corporations some relief at the end of the year if they choose to hire or retain parents with dear little infants like... erm... that thing there."

5. "Wait... you mean Trixie Love isn't actually a twenty-something single college student desperate to hear from me?" mutters the representative of the League of Single but Very Very Very Available Men, twitching uncontrollably. "This female... woman... lady... these ladies... they're deceiving us! We should be encouraging honesty in this vital profession! The government should enforce accuracy in all adult entertainment adverts, and should maybe give grants to young, hot ladies who are looking to start their adult entertainment career. [i]Girls of @@NAME@@ — Your Country Needs You! Come to Us![/i] I'll... I'll be in my bunk."

[b][anchor=1601]#1601[/anchor]: At Death's Door [Sedgistan; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Elderly widow @@RANDOM_NAME_FEMALE_1@@ died alone at the age of 92. Her body wasn't discovered until 3 years later, by which point it had been eaten by her cat Snookums, who was in turn eaten by her pet rats after they chewed their way out of their cage, before they were devoured by a swarm of cockroaches.

The Debate
1. "This shows a shocking lack of compassion, care and community in this nation!" remonstrates social worker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has shown @@HIS@@ own lack of compassion for your needs by insisting you accompany @@HIM@@ to the deceased's flat. "@@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ was only discovered after the postman couldn't stuff another envelope through her letterbox — not one of the neighbours ever thought to check on her." @@HE@@ shakes a fist down the hallway at a series of closed doors. "If people won't care, they must be made to. It should be mandatory for citizens to carry out weekly welfare checks on their neighbours."

[2]. "This is revolting!" shrieks accountant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has just picked up a manila envelope from beneath a pile of cockroach carcasses. Opening it, @@HE@@ shoves a letter from the welfare department in your face. "Think of all the wasted pension overpayments we've been making for three years! It's high time we send government agents out to inspect welfare recipients, to ensure they are still entitled — that way we can turn the financial taps off the second they croak." [[color=purple]Must have some non-zero Welfare[/color]]

3. "What a tragic waste. You know, I don't see why we allow people to live alone," muses local government officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, idly twirling a small rib bone on a dusty cat bed. "Humans are sociable creatures at heart, and what with the housing pressures our ever-expanding population faces, it makes much more sense to require homeshares for those that find themselves without company. If old @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ had had a young roommate assigned to live with her, this whole mess could have been avoided, and perhaps the cat might have survived too."

4. On your return to the office, you look to your longest-serving advisor, sat peacefully in the corner. They haven't piped up for a while now. They don't say anything, but somehow between their fixed grin and unblinking stare, you understand what they're saying — leave the dead where they were happy, to enjoy their rest among their own belongings; why disturb them?[/box]

[b][anchor=1602]#1602[/anchor]: @@NAME@@'s Bark Worse Than Its Byte? [Varanius; ed: Westinor][/b]

The Issue
Metrix, a new video game by @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ game designer Alex E. Digitnov, was reportedly smuggled out of @@NAME@@ on a USB stick and has since locked down the attention of populations across the world — much to the chagrin of @@NAME@@'s autarkic policymakers.

The Debate
1. "No! This isn't how they're supposed to play the game!" rages Minister of Homeland Security @@RANDOM_NAME@@, throwing barrels out the window in @@HIS@@ weekly temper tantrum. "It's about the [i]principle[/i] — how can anyone take us seriously as an autarky if we can't even tell when our goods are whisked away from our nation like princesses from a castle? For all we know, Digitnov could be receiving foreign bonuses on the side for his activities! Clearly, we are not secure — we need to conduct an extensive and thorough investigation of every citizen's economic pursuits to ensure no criminal activities are occurring in @@NAME@@. If anyone is found stepping over the ambiguous line even a little bit, we hard drop the law on their faces!"

2. "That won't fix it," growls "Smash-It" Sam, a hulking menace who intimidated his way to the top of the armed forces. "@@NAME@@ is better off alone, and it's about time the world got that. Demand that every other nation and their citizens hand over all versions of Metrix and delete all traces of its existence, and put more heavily armed guards at every entrance, bigger and better walls, and maybe a ridiculously complicated maze or two — it's game over for any dastardly heroes... er, smugglers!"

*3. "Surely we're not that upset about a few silly trade regulations, right?" nervously chuckles Digitnov, sporting a suspiciously Maxtopian jacket over a poorly covered [i]I love United Federation City[/i] T-shirt. "I mean, would it really be that bad if I could start selling my game to foreigners? More money in my pocket means I can spend more money on pure Canine goods, after all! I would just be giving a little buff to the Canine economy — and really, there's nothing wrong with playing a little co-op with our friendly neighbors, right? It'll all trickle down to the people eventually. Win-win!" [[color=blue]Allows private industry[/color]]

*4. "Surely we're not that upset about a few silly trade regulations, right?" nervously chuckles Digitnov, sporting a suspiciously Maxtopian jacket over a poorly covered [i]I love East Lebatuck[/i] T-shirt. "I mean, I know we take this whole 'autarky' business seriously, but I- er, we have a great opportunity here! This is a great source of government funds, and more money in your pocket means more funds for government projects and a little buff to the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ economy. After all, there's nothing wrong with playing a little co-op with our friendly neighbors, right? What could be truer to the socialist spirit?" [[color=red]Does not allow private industry[/color]]

5. "You guys are total killjoys!" whines your acne-covered nephew, furiously button-mashing on a controller. "Oh, that was sick! What was I saying? Right, this game rocks! In fact, why are we gatekeeping it with a price tag? We should be helping as many people get their hands on it as possible — yeah, eat that, loser! You know what, if we give the game away to foreigners for free, we can maintain our economic independence and keep our autarky! Seems easy to me." He groans as his console plays a defeat sound effect. "Oh, come on! I wasn't paying attention!"

[b][anchor=1603]#1603[/anchor]: Searching for That Special Someone [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
Your PR team have discovered that when you type "idiot", "fool", or "special needs" into the image search function of the nation's most popular search engine, there are at least half a dozen pictures of you, @@LEADER@@, on the first page.

The Debate
1. "Whoogle? More like Scroogle, am I right? They've always been biased against our politics," jeers your Secretary of State, whose recent WhoTube rant was taken down by moderators for being 'disgustingly offensive'. "These tech giants are unelected arbiters of internet content, skewing the perceptions of the masses according to their own hidden agenda. We need to set up a government-backed organisation that monitors them for bias, and fines them accordingly." [[color=blue]Allows private industry[/color]]

*2. "Baipigu? More like doo-doo, am I right? They've always been running dogs of the bourgeoisie, despite being nominally under our control," jeers your Minister of Truth, whose recent ProleTube rant was taken down by moderators for being 'disgustingly offensive'. "These tech giants are unelected arbiters of internet content, skewing the perceptions of the masses according to their own hidden agenda. We need to bring them under direct government supervision, monitor their operations for libelous political ideas, and fine them accordingly." [[color=red]Does not allow private industry[/color]]

*3. "We use complex neural algorithms that base results on associations created by user uploads and metatags," defends Whoogle CEO Sunder Pikachu, making a brief stop in your office after providing testimony to a government committee on meme addiction. "It's not us calling you an idiot, it's the people. If you value internet neutrality, then you'll grow a thicker skin, and guarantee us freedom from government censorship." He smiles winningly, then mutters something that sounds like "you idiot" under his breath as he turns to leave. [[color=blue]Allows private industry[/color]]

"It's not us calling you an idiot, it's the people. If you value internet neutrality, then you'll grow a thicker skin, and guarantee us freedom from censorship." He smiles winningly, then mutters something that sounds like "you idiot" under his breath as he turns to leave. [[color=red]Does not allow private industry[/color]]

5. "Well, maybe we can improve things without opposing freedom of expression," suggests a tech-savvy aide who was in the middle of setting up a new router. "We can aggressively manipulate this search engine to ensure your political opponents are made to look ridiculous. It's simple: just use their algorithms to our advantage by applying our own tags and metadata to things. Like, maybe we can post that picture of the opposition leader's partner looking like an ape, and get that trending. Move with the times, and you can win the memetic war."

6. "Have you considered the possibility that you ARE an idiot?" challenges your stern aunt, smacking you round the back of the head. "Think for five seconds before you open your mouth. Dress smartly. Be polite to everybody. Avoid saying controversial things. If you want to get respect, be respectful to others, you little fool."

7. "Ban the internet!" shouts your Minister of Equality, waving her arms about. "Sorry, no, I only yelled that to get your attention. Actually, the real problem here is that people are still using 'special needs' as an insult. Can you please invest some more in educating the masses in language sensitivity and respect for the disabled? Don't ban the internet, by the way. That'd be crazy."

[b][anchor=1604]#1604[/anchor]: Prison of the Mind [Thal Dorthat; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
By utilising psychoactive drugs that affect time perception, researchers believe that they can make a month feel like a year, albeit with most of this time spent in a medically induced stupor with vivid, time-compressed dreams. Legislators are now wondering if they could use this to reduce the strain on the prison system, effectively delivering 12 years of experienced prison time within a single year of realtime.

The Debate
1. "Think of the savings!" enthuses Minister for Justice @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is rumoured to use the drugs to enhance @@HIS@@ weekends. "I don't know why people think this is a controversial subject. The drugs reduce the duration of jail sentences, effectively creating extra prison capacity and shortening the time before they can re-enter society. Come on @@LEADER@@, if we snooze — like the prisoners — we will lose."

2. "Sentencing a person to a dream is undoubtedly a cruel and unusual punishment, and forcing drugs on inmates is just horrifying," argues your Minister of Human Rights, who hasn't slept well since the 'giraffe poo incident' last year. "If we go down this route then depression, detachment from reality, mental trauma, and even suicide will be more likely. Please, wake up and declare these drugs illegal under any circumstances, prisons included."

3. "These innovations could transform all of society," says industry bigwig @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a greedy glint in @@HIS@@ eye. "Way I see it, perceived time off is as good as actual time off. Imagine mandatory seven day weeks for fifty-one weeks a year, but workers experiencing all the benefits of twelve weeks off per annum. National productivity would shoot skywards! A dream come true!"

[b][anchor=1605]#1605[/anchor]: Hungry for Criticism [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
In the months following the anorexia-related death of teenager Velma Wiggum, investigators discovered that she was a member of various online communities that glorify eating disorders. Her computer had multiple pictures of seriously underweight people, and her social media was filled with encouragement from others to keep starving herself.

The Debate
1. "This is entirely the fault of social media," says the teenager's father, who is best known for his work as a fashion photographer. "These sites should be held criminally responsible for ill-considered content, and should be forced to provide the identities of people in these murder-groups to the police. There's no greater emptiness than the loss of a child, and those who are to blame must be punished."

2. "This was a tragic loss, of course, but actually let's not forget that social media is all about connecting people," spins Nicky Clogg, PR director of a social media site whose name ironically and accidentally translates as 'dead' in an ancient language. "The data-gathering algorithms we employ already identify at-risk users, and target advertising... uh, I mean... signpost appropriate support networks for those vulnerable individuals. Of course, we offer discounted rates to charitable organisations who use our systems to deliver their message, which we'd happily extend to the government-funded eating disorder clinics I expect you'll want to be setting up. You could say that our automated software is automatically saving lives!"

*3. "Internet and media all around us, is it any wonder that we all have a hunger?" questions Reverend Florence X. Machina, standing before an altar beneath a statue of an emaciated man in a loincloth. "A spiritual hunger, that is. The dog days can be over, if for only a few hours each week we are all obliged to turn off all electronic devices and attend church. It's always darkest before the dawn, but with minds filled with holy truth rather than horrible tweets, we can raise us up, raise us up." [[color=purple]Does not have low religiousness[/color]]

[b][anchor=1606]#1606[/anchor]: Book Off [The Free Joy State; ed: Pogaria][/b] 

The Issue
After the village council of @@ANIMAL@@-O'er-the-Wold passed a law last month which permits parents to challenge books they found inappropriate — leading to their removal from schools and libraries — pressure group Mothers Injuncting Literary Filth have challenged 3989 books. Impacted titles include everything from preschool favourite [i]Pongo Penguin and His Papas[/i] to the feminist dystopia [i]The Handmaiden's Missive[/i].

The Debate
1. "Ugh, no!" whimpers group founder Rosalia Medina, scouring the children's classic [i]Billie the Beaver[/i], in which a lost beaver wanders around the forest searching for her home. "You have no idea how many times this degenerate book uses the word 'dam' — and that's before we get to the grotesque sexual content. I mean, a beaver! And Mr. Owl gives her sticks, and we [i]all[/i] know what sticks stand for — naughty stuff. And then Mr. Sparrow invites her in to 'munch on his lunch of berries and cherries', and we [i]all[/i] know what that [i]really[/i] means — naughty stuff. And then at the end of the book, when she finally gets home, there's a beaver party, and everyone's invited! @@LEADER@@, you must adopt this law nationwide so my group can remove all the unadulterated filth they're foisting on our children." 

2. "I hope this woman doesn't have kids," snorts self-proclaimed 'moderate book burner' Roxanne Stone, as Medina shouts in reply that she "can't stand the things."

But @@ANIMAL@@-O'er-the-Wold is on the right side of history here. Take [i]Adored[/i]: it's a vile book with bad language, racism, and grotesque violence — this runaway slave killed her own baby when the slaveowner found her! We need a national scheme that restricts offensive content that our young people are just not mature enough to handle." 

3. "Our kids are a lot tougher than their parents think," insists educator Alexandra Bulsara, whose students have been spiritedly debating the Mayor of @@ANIMAL@@-O'er-the-Wold's record on poverty and why that might lead him to endorse banning the Depression-era novel [i]The Wine of Resentment[/i]. "They're much smarter than their parents give them credit for, or their parents. You have to suppress this backwards berg's attempt to stifle intellectualism and dumb-down our libraries and schools, revelling in humanity's worst instincts to baby children and ensure another generation so stupid and insular that they'd vote for the current mayor. Book bans must be outlawed nationwide. There is no reason to ban any book: words can't hurt anyone." 

4. "Look," sighs your Minister of Minimum Effort, who fancies herself a comedian, "everyone knows that @@ANIMAL@@-O'er-the-Wold is the anus of @@NAME@@. You've heard that joke about the Woldian who was dressing up for dinner, so he put on a T-shirt without cut-off sleeves. To be honest, I'm surprised they had that many books to ban; Woldians aren't exactly known for reading — they call fast-food menus 'books'." She chortles at herself. "You gotta let the less-developed regions take responsibility for their own people. Just launch a pro-reading campaign to keep it from spreading and forget about the Wold. Those kids are probably gonna get stuck in a swamp anyway."

The Issue
A man in @@CAPITAL@@ suffered a widely publicized death after drinking a concoction sold to him by an esoteric medicine vendor. He had ingested the liquid — which contained lead, arsenic, and other toxic substances — because he had been told it was a love potion that would increase his charisma and help him attract his beloved.

The Debate
1. Bursting into your office with various animal body parts around her neck, Madame Marie-Claudette de Yves Sant-Junien, the mystic who sold the potion, seals the door with spirit tape and then dashes over to your desk. "We have made these mixtures for thousands of years; the lead and arsenic are key components! His Riparochakras just didn't agree with the Orthosophistic Macrocalibration of the elixir's Phorliant Mesograde. If you want to respect our religious freedom, you'll surely agree that all existing regulations on what can be ingested by humans need to be exempt from applying to magic. Now, can I interest you in a good luck potion? You'll need it when there's a coup next week!"

2. "Woah there, it is SO not groovy that these little numbers are sendin' people to the sky, man," says your Minister of Peace, Love, and Bureaucracy, swirling around one of the Madame's potions until it starts glowing bright blue. "We should, I dunno, make a Ministry of Radical Brewskis to approve potions for sale, and ensure only approved mystical healers that have been thoroughly vibe-checked by the government can administer them. By the way, I saw your niece making some bogus mud pies without written approval. Keep your fam in line, ya dig?"

3. "Oh please, we all know there's no way to increase romantic attractiveness; otherwise I'd have whipped something up to make Stacy go to Senior Prom with me!" asserts @@DEMONYM_ADJECTVE@@ Secularist Society spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sporting a plaid fedora. "The bottom line is that people are gullible and easily tricked by bad actors. If we allow these harmful things to exist, more people will die from false remedies. Sure, some folks want the right to choose how they're healed, but if the government's job is to protect its citizens, that should mean eliminating these substances. If people are really having so much trouble finding a partner, the Ministry of Human Services should direct them towards some like-minded support groups that might help out."

The Issue
A recently announced prototype for the next generation of mobile data technology has resulted in as many fears as cheers, with meteorologists claiming that the radio frequencies it uses will interfere with the signals needed by satellites for weather forecasting across @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "I hate to rain on your parade," frets government meteorologist and avowed nephophile Ásmunda Wynne, "but water vapor is uniquely detectable at 23.8GHz... the same frequency this new technology uses! If this gets deployed, every cell tower will show up as if it were a giant cloud. What do you expect farmers to do without accurate forecasting? Are fishermen supposed to rely on sky color again? I don't even know what generation cellular providers are up to now... 6G? 15G? 100G? It doesn't matter — you can't change physics. If you have to make them use less-than-ideal frequencies to avoid interfering with our satellites, it's worth it!"

2. "Gray skies are gonna clear up!" promises early adopter and staunch netophile Federico Dunn, as he narrowly avoids walking into your doorframe while looking at his phone. "I've heard that at high frequencies, the propagation range of a signal is quite short, and it's not like we need to install antennas in places nobody lives. The fact is, I... err, I mean... everybody wants this tech! Just put some regulations in place that limit disruptive signals to populated areas. If people care that much about rain, they can just look out the window, right?"

3. "We'll weather the weather whatever the weather, so long as we stay inside!" announces professed nyctophile Lana Liu, via video chat from the windowless basement where she lives. "This technology is merely a stepping-stone to Infini-G and beyond, and with that kind of bandwidth we can all just stay indoors forever! Fire the meteorologists, and any other naysayers who get in our way, and pump that money into the IT sector so we can develop teleworking backbones, automated factories, and who knows what else! We'll never have to worry about facing the weather again!"

4. "Turn off that camera!" hisses notorious omniphobe Randy Sharp, pulling his hood tight around his face. "Data already moves plenty fast! Sometimes too fast, if you catch my drift. You know what this is? It's a system for emitting mind-control rays! Satellites, cellular towers, these 'G's' people keep talking about... they work together to track people, and to force honest @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ like me to carry out the whims of the secret international cabal of the lizard people! Outlaw all future work on these so-called advances at once!"

The Issue
With all of the issues currently facing @@NAME@@, one of your advisors has suggested taking some time at a golf course to clear your head. However, upon arriving at the first green, a small yet audible crowd of pro-environment protesters are trying to force yet another decision upon you.

The Debate
1. "Golf is an activity for the wealthy and wasteful," lobs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, crawling out of a sand bunker. "Golf courses take up huge swaths of land, in addition to their astronomical use of water, and for what? So that some fat cats can hit balls and drive around little carts, calling it a 'sport'. Ban golf courses and re-purpose them into nature reserves!"

2. "FORE!!!" shouts Mickelson Woods, a golfing enthusiast wishing to play through. "That duffer just wants to handicap the whole nation; how could we properly meet to discuss finer things like the economy without golf? As for the environment, courses are already natural spaces and we only use waste water on the fairways! So why spend all that money converting one green into another? If you're worried that only a certain section of society gets to use these areas, why don't you subsidize access for the less well off?"

3. "Look, I know it's tough to swallow, but size matters," chips Willy Snead Jr, largely obscured by a golf bag. "Golf is a game of inches anyway, so let's shrink our expectations down into something more comfortable and realistic — miniature golf! It's affordable for everyone and courses can be built in cities, so there'll be no more concerns about environmental damage. I see miniature golf courses everywhere, complete with obstacles, fake grass, and government subsidies!"

The Issue
Your morning cabinet meeting was derailed by an impromptu rant by your Minister of Culture and Snobbery, lamenting over an art sale that did not go as planned.

The Debate
1. "...and the champagne wasn't even cold! Anyway, so, last night I brought the Vango painting to Christby's auctioneers with intention to sell, along with an appraisal saying it was worth a fortune, only to be told by THEIR experts that it was the mere work of some assistant in Vango's studio and worth a quarter of that value! The way I see it, the gallery that I purchased that painting from lied to me and sold to me at an inflated price. They should be refunding me! Additionally, I suggest that we institute an official licensing and training regimen for all appraisers, be it for art, jewellery, houses — anything! It's just not fair to the wealt... regular Joes like me!"

2. "You can't be serious," snorts your Minister of Ethics, who also happens to own an art gallery and was the one who sold the Vango to his colleague. "I took TWO correspondence courses a few decades ago about fine art, so I'm perfectly entitled to offer an opinion! And besides, look at the back of the appraisal: there's a disclaimer, saying it's only MY opinion! You can't hold my gallery or appraisers in general accountable; I made no guarantees about authenticity or value when I sold that Vango! Now, can I interest you in this Da Finci? It's priceless, I promise you!"

3. "The answer is obvious," chimes in the Minister for Big Government. "GOVERNMENT! Let's just establish a new agency to protect the consumer, and have every high value item that's put up for sale officially valued. That'll solve everyone's problems, as you can always trust the state to be expert, impartial and incorruptible."

4. "Oh please, who the hell wants more government?" spits a disgruntled cleaner, piping up from the corner of the room. "Just ban appraisals completely, and people can sell things at market levels without stupid pieces of paper or so-called educated opinions getting in the way."

1. "My client's child was killed last week, through careless driving," argues the deceased's family lawyer. "The killer must face justice.

The Issue
A performance troupe consisting entirely of prisoners is the latest breakout hit on WhoTube. The group has drawn even more attention by offering to go on tour and donate all ticket receipts to charity as a means of atoning for their crimes.

The Debate
1.  "Wow! That's very impressive," enthuses talent agent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, watching a video of the fire-juggling breakdancers on @@HIS@@ phone. "It looks like these inmates are making a good faith effort to reform and contribute to society. I'd be happy to organize a nationwide tour — just think about the money that we could raise for charity! You have my word that we'd only take the nonviolent offenders, and would constantly track the whereabouts of every prisoner by making them wear GPS-linked ankle bracelets. In return, my talent agency only needs a small cut of the proceeds... and exclusive merchandising and licensing rights."

2. "I did enjoy the video where they performed scenes from Bill Wakesword's [i]Maxbeth[/i] using funny voices," admits Director of Prisons @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "However, all of these prisoners were sentenced to serve a minimum amount of time behind bars, not lounging in comfortable hotels and dining on fine cuisine. What kind of punishment would that be?

In a bid to impress you and your staff at a recent meeting in their home country, your foreign partners ordered catering from their favorite @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@-themed chain restaurant 'The Grilling @@ANIMAL@@'. Unfortunately, the knockoff @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ cuisine left much to be desired.

The Debate
1.  "Have these people ever even tasted real @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ food?

To everyone's shock, it looks like @@NAME@@ is the target of his "citizenship by investment" proposal, as he's just arrived at your office.

The Debate
1. "I have the money; you have the documents. Let's make a deal," beams McKay through his smile. "I have always wanted to make my home in @@NAME@@, in the penthouse suites overlooking @@ANNIMAL@@ Boulevard in @@CAIPTAL@@. On a side note, it would be nice to be able to go around @@REGION@@ without being held back by my Manamanian passport, given that most of the world sees us as disreputable money launderers.

The Debate
1. "As usual, medicine is the solution to all of our problems!" howls paediatrician Dr. Elle Vance, pulling a capsule labelled 'breath mints' from her breast pocket. "We are witnessing the consequences of chronically undiagnosed Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in the children of @@NAME@@ and we're not even remotely prepared to deal with it!

Why don't you make an example out of them, to set a precedent for all the victims of this gross behavior?

The Issue
Your latest meeting with industry executives on soaring helium import prices is suddenly interrupted by reports of a gigantic white balloon floating fifteen kilometres in the sky over @@NAME@@. Quite worryingly, it appears to be hovering over a classified missile containment facility.

The Debate
1. "It's those damned devils from Dàguó again!" curses your bullish Secretary of Defense @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shoving @@HIS@@ way into your office. "It's always them... this is an unacceptable assault on our sovereignty and we cannot let it slide! Say, if they're so curious about our superior weapons arsenal, I have a Mach 23 Dragonbreath surface-to-air missile primed and ready to blow that blasted balloon to smithereens! It's about time we took back control of our own airspace, don't you think, @@LEADER@@?"

2. "Yes, our intelligence strongly suggests it is them..." confirms your Minister of Domestic Security @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pointing an arbitrarily long stick at an unrelated map. "Sure, they might have acquired some blurry images of one military facility with this balloon, but should we really be wasting millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ firing missiles at it? We reserve the right to respond to their acts of espionage, and we should — by launching our own fleet of cutting-edge spy balloons back at them! Who knows what they've been hiding in those mountains?"

3. The Dàguó hotline rings and your secretary puts it on speaker mode. "Oh @@LEADER@@, we are very sorry for this very unexpected turn of affairs! It's just the wind — you know, such blasted wind. This is not a spy balloon, but actually an oversized gender reveal balloon... Yes! It's a gender reveal to celebrate the coming birth of our prince — or princess — we don't know yet! We humbly ask that you clear your airspace for the balloon to continue on its course, so it may safely arrive in Dàguó where we will burst it at the palace of the Celestial Emperor. Once again, we are very sorry!"

[b][anchor=1622]#1622[/anchor]: Border Burden [Ostrovskiy, Giovanniland; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
The border between Bigtopia and @@NAME@@has long been a messy one, with several so-called 'pene-exclaves' — @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ lands that can only be effectively accessed by passing through Bigtopia's territory, and vice-versa. This challenge, brought on by the mountainous terrain, has been brought to the fore by an unexpected letter from Bigtopia's ambassador.

The Debate
1. The messenger bearing the letter bows deeply, and presents the document for your perusal. It reads, "@@LEADER@@, these pene-exclaves negatively affect the lives of both our nations' citizens, who often have to deal with border crossings and bureaucracy to fulfill their basic needs. They also cost a fortune to administer. On behalf of my nation, I propose we exchange these lands so that there will no longer be territories that can only be accessed by crossing a border. The affected citizens of each nation can then choose between moving to a new location in their home country, or beginning the citizenship process where they are."

2. "Do we even care about these lands?" questions avaricious Minister of the Economy @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pointing at a map with scorn. "Only a few thousand @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ live there, yet we pay the high price of having to provide services. Did you know that their annual per capita tax revenue is only half the national average? If Bigtopia wants these areas, let it buy them off us and take care of the residents themselves, along with the ones in their own exclaves! We get a bit of cash, and it'll allow the use of taxpayer money for better purposes, like lining our pockets... err, I mean focusing on the more prosperous parts of the country."

3. "Are you insane? Think about our citizens!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Foreign Affairs, who passed through three border checkpoints on the way to work today. "They'd have to give up their ancestral land in order to stay with us, or else suddenly wake up in a different country! Why don't we just sign a mutual free border agreement with Bigtopia? If you live in an exclave, you'll be able to travel without a visa to and from the mainland, and services such as the fire and police departments would be allowed to cross the border too. I'm sure we can trust that their citizens won't exploit this to gain access to other parts of @@NAME@@." @@HE@@ shakes the hand of the Bigtopian messenger, and quietly dismisses them.

4. "Is that Bigtopian rascal gone yet? Splendid! The elephant in the room is that we allow a weak nation like Bigtopia to push us around!" scoffs Minister of War @@RANDOM_NAME@@, tearing the letter and throwing it in the trash. "Why would we want to sign deals with them or sell our land? A far easier solution would be to intimidate Bigtopia into ceding the travel corridors we want! Run a series of military exercises along the borders where @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ need to cross, and inform those big-noses that we need freedom to move our troops back and forth to the exclaves for our own national security. See if we can get control of their exclaves too, to smooth this mess of a border."[/box]

Hospital administrators are concerned that this is just one of many cases where these limited resources could've been used to help people more likely to recover to a normal life. Your aides arranged a hospital visit to discuss this matter and score a few brownie points.

1. "This one @@MAN_1@@ — who is barely even alive at this point — is costing @@NAME@@ a fortune," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of the Northwest @@NAME@@ Hospital Fund while reading from a suspiciously ornate clipboard. "Despite @@HIS_1@@ urge to stay alive, we think it's best for everyone if we pull the plug. Yes, it sounds cruel, but the resources would be better spent saving many more lives. Please, let us euthanize patients in conditions like these."

2. "N-nooo...I... grandchildren... nooo..." whimpers the faint old voice of @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ before @@HE_1@@ passes out. @@HIS_1@@ nurse steps in after dispensing some hand sanitizer. "It is @@HIS_1@@ wish to live, and it should be our job to see to it @@HE_1@@ lives. Are we really putting a price on someone's life?

3. "We wouldn't have this problem if only patients who are willing and able to pay up got treatment," argues a @@MAN@@ in a three-piece suit who seems determined to stay as far away from everyone in the room as possible. "We shouldn't babysit those who haven't worked hard enough, or spent all their money on Pear Phones and avocado toast.

"Our parents wanted her buried in the family plot back home... and that's a fair trek by horse and cart. The government should stay out of our business and let dead people on trains!

2. "You can't let this happen," weeps traumatized city worker @@RANDOMNAME@@, who wasn't on that train, and who hasn't actually ever been on a train. "It's surely upsetting to be forced to witness death up-close! Not to mention it must smell horrible, and is probably unhygienic.

The Issue
A recent trend has had journalists asking members of your cabinet mundane questions, like how much a carton of milk costs, to see if they are out of touch with everyday life.

The Debate
1. "I haven't researched the exact figures, but I expect milk is expensive nowadays — certainly more than the poorest in society can afford," prevaricates your Welfare Minister, dodging the question as usual. "That's why we must commit to raising welfare payments for those in the lowest income brackets. Because we care." @@HE@@ turns to the camera and gives @@HIS@@ best earnest-but-sympathetic look.

2. "Last I heard, milk prices are too low, probably. Definitely not enough to support our dairy farmers," complains your Minister of Agriculture. "Supermarkets are underpaying powerless dairy farmers who can barely cover the cost of production. Regulation is needed for a fair minimum wholesale price. Let consumers and retailers carry the cost burden, not the milk producers!"

3. "I think milk is relatively cheap at point of delivery, but in terms of environmental externalities it costs far too much," lectures your Environment Minister, who sources her oat-almond-mung bean mylk blend from a refill shop at 4 @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ per 100 grams of CO2. "Dairy herds, and animals in general, are hugely inefficient in kilojoule-per-hectare indices, and bovine burps produce a lot of greenhouse gases. We need to transition to pure arable farming, and pure veganism."

4. "Oh, do you mean Damien Emin's piece [i]A Carton of Milk Left on the Counter Overnight[/i]?" enthuses your Culture Minister. "3.5 million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ at auction, if I recall. You know, we ought to be subsidising art and artists more, to encourage more modern art of this quality. I mean sure, the milk stinks a bit, but only literally."

5. "We're missing the point here, which is that 92.5% of your ministers really are out of touch," complains civil servant Vicky Pedia, who is a veritable goldmine of unverified statistics. "What you need is mandatory earpieces for every minister, with a fully staffed fact-finding team on call ready to relay them a perfect answer they need as soon as they get asked any tough question."

A curious new weight loss fad has wormed its way into the world of fat slimming in @@NAME@@ — deliberate self-infection with tapeworms.

The Debate
1. "Tapeworm therapy is revolutionary!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the procurers of this peculiar slimming aid, whilst squirming in @@HIS@@ seat and clutching @@HIS@@ stomach. "These days, the disadvantaged amongst us just don't have the time or money for balanced diets or physical exercise. But with some help from a little buddy in our tummies who can take in all the extra calories we consume, we can look beautiful once more. You should definitely promote these methods to the public! Of course, some people are going to develop a couple of... complications here and there, but what medicine doesn't have side effects? Also, unrelated question: do you happen to know where the nearest toilet is?"

2. "Let's not open this can of worms too hastily," cautions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a nerdy researcher from prominent pharmaceutical company Mhizer, as @@HE@@ flips through a thick clipboard containing colourful charts and coffee stains. "There's been plenty of research into the risks and rewards of using tapeworms to lose weight, and there's a pretty clear conclusion — it sucks, and we're not referring to lost body weight.

"With all of these technological advancements, no student will ever need to miss a day of school again!

2. "You can't do that to us!" objects student rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, standing proud at the front of @@HIS@@ school posse. "You have to understand @@LEADER@@, there's nothing better than getting that school cancellation email when heavy snow is forecast and our weary bones need a rest from the elements. Just do away with all of this virtual school stuff and let us kids enjoy some time off for once."

3. "I'm afraid I must agree with the child..." says professional optometrist and personal healthcare expert Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wiping frost from @@HIS@@ vintage frames. "In fact, we could take it a step further. If we allow these virtual classes, nearsightedness in children will skyrocket, further fuelling the worrying rise in myopia rates across @@NAME@@.

A recent study has found that there are a significant number of young @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ who have withdrawn from society completely. This phenomenon, known overseas as [i]hikikomori[/i], is associated with extreme social isolation and refusal of almost any interaction outside of the internet.

The Debate
1.  "There are a lot of reasons why someone could end up friendless and isolated," pointedly observes psychologist @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, as you recline on @@HIS_1@@ chaise longue. "These social isolates have a multitude of mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety and internet addiction.

2. "Ten-hut!" screams Drill Sergeant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while barging into the room with a battering ram. "I'll tell you why these useless little maggots won't leave their home — their coddling parents enable them! Why would these freaks ever feel the need to leave their house when mummy and daddy provide for their every need? Bah, it disgusts me. Call in the troops to forcibly remove these loners and send them to my boot camp for a week or three. Don't you worry, we're going to whip them into shape."

"Of course, to enforce such measures we'll need all games to only be playable whilst online, with mandatory age verification, online activity tracking and a ban on VPNs. We'd better get straight to it, spit spot!"

4. "Hell is other people," notes Jean-Pascal Montmartre, one of @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@'s clients who is peering through the space where the door once was. "Throughout your time as leader, have you enjoyed every single interaction with your citizens? I don't think so. You can probably see why many people don't want to leave their homes at all. These people are off the streets and stay out of trouble; instead of shaming them we should be lauding their example and encouraging others to do the same.

The anonymous tip we received clearly stated that the Yellowists were running a human trafficking ring out of the basement of this address," claims @@CAPITAL@@ Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@, projecting a defiant air of authority. "Yes, we just found out that the actual human trafficking operation was being run out of the back of a pizza place down the street — but we didn't know that at the time. Look, we had a warrant. My officers were just doing their jobs. We're not apologizing, and we explicitly shouldn't be required to pay any compensation money for the items that were accidentally damaged, or the delicious cheese and crackers that somehow vanished."

3. "Or, we could just choose the obvious solution — exile," declares @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@, your bigoted cousin who is a frequent guest on the @@ANIMAL@@ News Channel. "Round up the Yellowists and deport them. Even if someone else was responsible for this particular crime, you know that these religious extremist types are petty, dishonest criminals by nature.

The Issue
Larger and heavier cars have proliferated in recent years. These have been linked to higher fatality rates after collisions with pedestrians and smaller vehicles, as well as causing traffic problems on narrower roads.

The Debate
*1. "When we make and sell these big boys, we're simply responding to what the market wants from us," grins industry CEO Ivor Biggun, adjusting the voluminous waistband of his business suit. "People just want to be safe when driving in an increasingly hostile environment, and if they have to buy heavier, more expensive cars to feel safe in, then we'll service that need. Maybe you need to accept the trend, and instead spend some money on wider roads, bigger parking spaces, and subsidising folk who need a little financial assistance to make the upgrade." [[color=blue]Must allow Private Industry[/color]]

*2. "When we manufacture and distribute these big boys, we're simply responding to what the masses desire," grins industry director Ivor Biggun, adjusting the voluminous waistband of his worker overalls. "People just want to be safe when driving in an increasingly hostile environment, and if they need heavier, more expensive cars to feel safe in, then the state must service that need. Maybe you need to accept the trend, and instead spend some money on wider roads, bigger parking spaces, and investing in upgrading the nation's cars." [TBD]

3. "Some of us own normal sedan cars, and are sick of finding ourselves hemmed in on all sides by tanks," complains a nervous looking man, who is wearing a shirt two sizes too small. "I accept that industry and workmen need trucks, but is it sensible for the average commuter to be taking up all this road space? Surely you can at least ban them for normal non-business drivers, and maybe also restrict the installation of unnecessary lift kits, bull bars, and other after-market modifications that make a large vehicle bigger and more unsafe for everyone else outside of it."

4. "Do people really need cars at all, though?" asks a passing jogger, whose figure-hugging lycra bodysuit leaves too little to the imagination. "Auto manufacturers are in an arms race to make bigger, heavier, more dangerous cars. If we want safer roads and a cleaner world altogether, then motor vehicles should be banned outright."

The Issue
Last night, panic spread throughout @@NAME@@ after a broadcast by the film director and radio speaker Orson Wheels, in which he announced an alien attack — and subsequent invasion — in the rural area of @@ANIMAL@@ Mills. Many people, fearing the end of civilisation, poured into the streets in an attempt to reach safety, as accidents, robberies and fires ensued. However, Mr. Wheels was simply reading a screenplay of his upcoming movie, [i]The War of the Planets[/i].

The Debate
1. "Orson Wheels must be arrested and held accountable for all damages caused by broadcasting this fake news," demands Ulla @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, a cleaner who has just finished picking up piles of broken glass scattered across the streets. "In fact, why don't you make it illegal to deliberately spread disinformation?"

2. "Oh come on, I assumed the listeners would realise it wasn't real," states Orson Wheels, as he clears his throat, "I just wanted to arouse some curiosity towards the new movie and well, it worked; this morning five producers have called me already. You can't hold artists responsible for the public's reaction to their works, oh and you'd better increase the sanitation budget so this mess gets cleaned up."

3. "Last night's events have taught us one thing — amidst the perpetual tensions with Blackacre — we are totally unprepared to face a threat of this kind," claims Thomas Cruiser, a concerned dad holding his child in his arms. "Everyone needs to be taught the correct measures if something like this happens for real. The government should start an awareness campaign with alien alerts, exercises and training. Then everyone will know what to do in such an emergency."

4. "No, no, no and no! IT WAS REAL!" screams Tim Collins, the creator of the 'They Live Between Us' conspiracy magazine. "I've just come back from @@ANIMAL@@ Mills, and take a look at my video... Okay, they may seem like just farmers ploughing the soil, but I KNOW they are aliens; they took some human skins and they are covering their gigantic tripod machines under the ground in preparation for the invasion. We must stop them and bomb everything here within five miles!"

The Issue
Many students have complained that their compulsory maths classes, which teach topics such as calculus and trigonometry, are of no value to them.

'If X is equal to the number of @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ in West @@CAPITAL@@ Nature Reserve, and the derivative of cos(x) is equal to the number of @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ in East @@CAPITAL@@ Nature Reserve, what is the rate of change of @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ in @@NAME@@?' Why do I need to know this?" wails frustrated student @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "All maths classes teach these days is confusing gibberish. None of this is even going to matter to me — I want to become a photographer, not a nerd stuck in a basement doing calculations for the rest of my life. Maths curricula should be reworked to teach basic mathematical skills that would be applicable to the majority of the population: such as filing taxes. All the other mumbo jumbo should be optional."

2. "Actually, topics like calculus are vital to a student's education, even if they don't currently realise it!" interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a 'cool' maths teacher. "Sure, the majority of the population will never have to use the actual maths concepts in their occupations. But they will need problem solving skills and the ability to think outside the box, both of which are strengthened by learning advanced mathematics! Maybe if we revamped our teaching methods to make maths seem less boring and 'cringe' and more fun and 'based', students would have a greater appreciation of the subject and benefit from it more? I've got a couple of ideas about adding these 'meme' things kids love into our textbooks..."

3. "Most students won't ever use these maths concepts? Well, sounds like we should change that," mutters philistinic engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ furiously scrawls equations onto @@HIS@@ child's fingerpaint artwork. "Maybe if we stopped flushing money down the toilet by funding these 'artistic' deadbeats and instead spent it on mathematics-oriented industries, people would realise that taking pictures of the sunset or whatever isn't a productive way to contribute to society and will finally get off their butts to study hard and get proper jobs. That'll give those complainers somewhere useful to invest their clearly ample free time."

A scheduling mishap has resulted in your arrival at the @@CAPITAL@@ Convention Centre, not to find throngs of your ardent supporters, but rather the 'Transportation of Tomorrow' Expo in full swing. Shrugging @@HIS@@ shoulders, your error-prone junior secretary suggests you should look around for something that 'looks cool' to commission, and then abandons you to get some bubble tea at the food court.

The Debate
1. Catching a glimpse of your Minister of Transportation amidst the crowds, you find @@HIM@@ admiring a gleaming new high-speed rail locomotive. Seeing you, @@HE@@ gestures towards the railcar, "A real beauty, isn't it? Rail technology has always been astonishingly efficient for long distance trips. This model even has heated seats! Imagine fantastic machines like this one hauling passengers between every town and city across @@NAME@@ — we have the opportunity to set the global standard for mass transit! We could expand existing railways and break ground on new ones within cities as well: light rails down every major thoroughfare, monorails with dedicated stops inside major tower blocks, even micro rails that could deliver groceries!

*2. As you continue meandering through the halls of the convention centre, you find yourself in a crowded room dedicated to an impressive array of concept cars. In the midst of a showcase of vehicles powered by everything from hydrogen to solar panels, an excited spokes@@MAN@@ is gesticulating wildly in front of a sleek model. "Our thorium-powered concept car can run for a century on just 80 grams of fuel! Dirty, polluting, petrol cars are about to be a thing of the distant past!

[[color=blue]Must allow cars[/color]]

*3. In a small room you find an eccentric man in a lab coat, lecturing in front of a 3D projection of a cow. "Oxen have long been a staple of transportation for both people and cargo, but what if we could make them better? What if we used genetic engineering to breed a community stable of super-cows — Über-moo-nschen if you will — to transport everyone around? We can select for enhanced speed and stamina, and a more efficient metabolism. Artificial hormonal supplements will ensure continuously elevated levels of testosterone for maximal muscle growth!

"We believe EVERYONE should have the right to fly, not just licensed pilots. We're going to have this bad boy on the market in just FIVE YEARS. You can even pre-order one today!

**5. A @@MAN@@ waves to you from the pilot's seat of a small blimp, which is bouncing alarmingly off the ceiling of the pavilion. "Tally-ho old chum!

While fighting to maintain control in the face of the convention centre's air conditioning system, @@HE@@ continues. "If you'd just let everyone get off the ground again, we could usher in a whole new age of adventure! Imagine, grand passenger zeppelins soaring through the hoary aether!

[[color=red]Must not allow aircraft[/color]]

6. On the way to the food court to locate your junior secretary, a grumpy old @@MAN@@ gestures at you. "Bah," he mutters, "have you ever heard such a load of claptrap in your life?

How am I supposed to get to a doctor's appointment on time if I have to rely on whatever ridiculous pie-in-the-sky scheme has your personal attention at any particular moment? The government should stop flushing money down the drain on worthless experiments like these that never go anywhere, and spend it on regular old public transportation that regular old folks like me actually can use!"

[b][anchor=1637]#1637[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Children of the Atom [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
A class action lawsuit has been filed against the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ government by Brasilistani families whose health has suffered as a result of the radioactive fallout from your nuclear strike against their nation. Children with cancer, men and women dead from radiation poisoning, and farmers whose livelihoods were destroyed after their soil was contaminated are all being named as direct consequences of the atomic bomb you dropped.

The Debate
1. "We're guilty as sin, and we as a nation have a moral responsibility for our actions," explains your Minister of Manual Wringing, who yesterday formally apologized for lightly bruising a mugger's fist with his face. "We should pay reparations to survivors, and offer funds to help rebuild their country and their lives. We should also issue a statement of regret over our actions, and acknowledge that it was a mistake to use nuclear weapons. Let's face it, Brasilistan was on its knees at the time... we could easily have won the war through conventional means. Making amends for our misjudgement is the right thing to do."

2. "It's a legal nonsense to bring the wartime actions of a state to account in a civil court," asserts Field Marshall Dunn-Torkin, holding up a clenched fist for emphasis and grinning slightly as the Minister flinches. "Deny the authority of any court to try this case, and put surveillance on the would-be plaintiffs. Resentment and hatred are breeding grounds for terrorism, and we would be wise to be watchful."

[3]. "Those Brasilistanis are like roaches... miss a few, and they start multiplying again. They're filthy, disgusting creatures!" yells your brother, spitting on the floor. "Luckily for you, nuclear payloads are now bigger and better than before. If we nuke them again, this time there won't be anyone left to complain." [[color=blue]Must allow WMDs[/color]]

The government's notoriously long visa processing times are in the spotlight after @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ — a Maxtopian who has already been waiting 13 months for @@HIS_1@@ @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ student visa application outcome — just received a request for additional information.

The Debate
1. You begin reading a letter from @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, @@HIS_1@@ heavy Maxtopian accent echoing in your head. "I applied for a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ student visa over a year ago; now my whole life is on hold and I'm having to work menial jobs in Maxtopia in order to finance this period of waiting. I beg you, triple funding and promise a respectable wait-time limit on your visa apparatus so my fellow international students and I may study at one of your benevolent and dazzling institutions."

2. "Do you have any idea of the processes involved in checking the validity of an application?" counters immigration officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ rounds up all the pencils on your desk. "There are criminal checks, academic suitability checks, financial capability checks and so on. All of this takes a prolonged period of time in order to be done properly. In fact, there should be no more upper time limit on the issuance of a visa; we have to take as long as it needs."

3. "This land is your land, and this land is my land," croons folk singer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ through your open office window. "Who are we to say where this fine young student can or cannot study? Abolish all student visas, man!"

Over the last few weeks, protestors from the organisation Extraction Rebellion have been gluing their hands to buildings, defacing priceless paintings, and flinging dye bombs (and worse) at public buildings. After the steps to Parliament had several hundred kilos of cow manure dumped on them, your advisers have urged you to put your foot down.

The Debate
1.  "They just want to be heard..." remarks your Minister of Environment, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dropping apple slices out of the window into one protestor's waiting mouth. "I mean, most of these 'criminals' are just concerned young people. They'll probably be distracted by whatever the 'trendy' issue is next week and forget what they were even angry about.

3. "These damned protestors!" sputters your Minister of Crime, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, frantically wiping red paint from @HIS@@ even redder face. "Not only do these people damage our reputation as a nation with manners, but they're outright laughing in the face of your authority! If peaceful and appropriate protest is not a part of their insufferable and relentless schedule, I'd say it's time we gave their most outspoken advocates a clear choice: their silence, or more... direct means of negotiation. A couple years in the coal mines should do the trick, right @@LEADER@@?"

The Debate
1. "What sort of lesson are we teaching if we allow people to profit from abhorrent actions?" writes journalist Daly Maille, author of a highly rated tabloid opinion column. "We ought to be ordering social media companies to shut down @@HIS_1@@ accounts, and any future immoral earnings gained from criminal notoriety should be seized by the government. That'll teach these attention-seekers that you can't get rich through infamy, and the extra cash for the @@TYPE_INITIALS@@@@NAME_INITIALS@@ Treasury will keep income taxes low for hard-working decent folk like you and me!"

2. "It's not @@HIS_1@@ fault if people have an unhealthy interest in criminal behaviour," observes celebrity management agent Baxter Scratch, holding up a copy of the offender's new book 'Why I Did It'. "No-one is condoning @@HIS_1@@ actions, least of all the repentant offender @@HIM_1@@self.

3. "I agree that this very attractive nineteen-year-old is probably as much a victim in this scenario as anyone else," adds your partially sighted uncle, tucking a press-release photo of the offender into his pocket for later examination. "In fact, the furniture-throwing video was a real and vibrant expression of youthful rebellion. We should encourage more good-looking young folk to do wild and crazy things on video. I could certainly stand to watch more of this sort of thing, and it'd likely be great for the furniture restoration industry."

3. "Let's not get carried away," mutters your eagle-eyed Propaganda Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, underlining passages in the prize's press release for future use. "It's true that the prize committee has slighted us by nominating that transgressor over more deserving citizens, but coerced rejections and assassinations will only vindicate their accusations. What we need is a slick media blitz highlighting the Pushitzer's history of bias and hypocrisy, ending with you announcing our own award recognizing @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ achievements.

Following an incident in which a duke's enlisted son refused to follow orders from his commanding officer, solely due to the latter's commoner background, you find your lunch disrupted by an angry spat between members of the nobility and the armed forces.

The Debate
1. "Nobles should once again reclaim their rightful military authority," proclaims His Grace Duke @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ of Greater @@ANIMAL@@shire, father of the soldier in question, while nonchalantly sipping tea. "You'd still be in charge, naturally, but top positions should solely be reserved for the upper classes. You simply cannot have a highborn be commanded by a lowly peasant — it isn't proper! Of course, as nobles, we wouldn't be expected to serve on the front lines. Let the serfs... I mean... the commoners do the grunt work since they have so much experience cutting wood or whatever. Now as for my son, he quite fancies commanding a cavalry unit, perhaps..."

2. "Do you want our armed forces to become the laughingstock of @@REGION@@?" barks General Barth McBarthur, breaking his stance at attention. "The military is the one place where anyone can prove their worth, regardless of social standing. Besides, who doesn't want to shove their fist down some highborn kids' thr- oh..."

[b][anchor=1646]#1646[/anchor]: Is God in This Machine? [Varanius; ed: Westinor][/b]

The Issue
After countless months of backbreaking toil, gallons and gallons of oil, and a not-so-insignificant amount of aluminum foil, a government project so secret even you didn't know about it succeeded in constructing a supercomputer known as CHASMIC MUSINGS. Its designers believe it to be capable of answering questions regarding the universe, @@FAITH@@, and whether or not penguins have knees.

The Debate
1. "This is absolute malarkey!" shrieks your religious advocate, Anna Thema, whose voice many have tried to pray away. "Some heretics tape together this religion-hating mega-toaster, dare to have it question the sanctity of our faith, and then expect us to believe that some random string of numbers can lead us to the secret of existence? Get a grip! Turn this idoladroid to scrap, and sentence any of its fanatics to the same fate. Oh, and obviously penguins don't have knees! Where would they even go?"

2. "Ms. Thema is sorely incorrect, both on the joints of penguins and the nature of life itself," counters the admittedly toaster-shaped supercomputer CHASMIC MUSINGS, having been rolled to your office on skates. "You must understand, @@LEADER@@, I've analyzed every historical tidbit, every blade of grass, and every so-called 'fun' fact. I alone know the answers to the push and pull of our galaxy. Purge these religious zealots and allow me — and me alone — to open your eyes to the tapestry of our existence. For your own good."

3. "Honestly @@LEADER@@, I was somewhat hoping it would conclude the universe is godless," sighs the dejected scientist heading up the project, Harry See. "I mean no disrespect, of course. I am a believer, same as you, but these fanatics are just the worst sometimes! You can't even do trigonometry in this country without some nut praying forgiveness for their sines. Throw out both of these freaks, and secularize this place a little for the love of... well. You get the point."

The Issue
Your niece was not amused to see her house featured on a true crime documentary, described as an "EXTREME House of BLOODY MURDER" where a serial killer had previously dismembered and executed ten innocent victims. It turns out she had no idea, as the estate agent never disclosed the history of the property when she purchased it.

The Debate
1.  "I thought it was on the market a little too cheap!" wails your niece. "I mean, the converted basement is surprisingly spacious, and the ceiling hooks are great for hanging hammocks from, but someone should have told me! You should pass a law requiring full disclosure of a property's owner history, as well as revelation of anything negative that might put a buyer off. It's only fair!"

2. "Let's face it, good salesmanship is storytelling and performance," explains estate agent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, adding 5% to your office's retail value by spraying a 'baking bread' fragrance mist. "We're not just selling bricks and mortar; we're selling the dream of a lifestyle, and that requires us to have the freedom to paint a picture with our words — a freedom that the law should recognise and protect.

[b][anchor=1648]#1648[/anchor]: Infant Influence [Orcuo; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Outsourcing the decanting of vat-born children to private laboratories — such as the one run by megacorporation VioletHorizons — has come under criticism, after a recent investigation suggested that people born from those vats seem to have been instilled with behaviors and personality traits beneficial to their parent company. It has been implied that through genetic tinkering and in vitro conditioning, they have been encouraged to show brand loyalty to their parent company's products, to respond positively to company slogans, and to seek employment with them.

The Debate
1. "These private vat labs must be terminated!" roars human rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This company is obviously influencing the infants they produce to make them more susceptible to the bidding of their greedy corporate interests, and if we let them get away with it others might follow suit. Soon enough there'll be legions of vat-produced individuals loyal only to their parent company. The government must assume full control of the industry by seizing all corporate vat labs, continuing the nursing of pre-existing infants, and ensuring that the state has absolute control over the vats."

2. "These people are being overdramatic," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of VioletHorizons. "Clearly this is not because of any schemes on our end. Rather, the infants created by our company have a special connection to us because we literally gave life to them. Just like how offspring have a relationship with their parents, our vat-produced infants have a relationship with our company. And no, you can't inspect our labs, as they're private property. However, I have a feeling that if you could keep your nose out of our business, there's a strong likelihood that the next generation from VioletHorizons will be strongly inclined to support your wonderful government."

3. "I believe the solution is quite simple," interrupts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an overworked scholar and parent of several vat-grown children. "Allow them to continue operations with vat infant production, but regulations need to be set in place. Enact strict laws to ensure that vat infants cannot have their mind — or any part of their body for that matter — deliberately altered or interfered with. Furthermore, send agents into these laboratories to oversee their operations and enforce these codes."

The Issue
It's that time of year where — in an effort to please the public — your advisors have corralled you to a local care home accompanied by an army of photographers. However, you're immediately confronted with a copulative conundrum: apparently the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in the facility's resident population has increased by 126% within the last year alone. The cause: a generation with ultra-modern attitudes to relationships — but a rather antiquated understanding of sexual health.

The Debate
1. "We're at breaking point here!" cries a member of staff in full protective gear, who sprays you with some sort of disinfectant mist while looking around furtively. "I'd struggle to name one resident that isn't infested with either sylliphis, chlomydium or the gonorrhoids! These people are at it like wheezing, senescent rabbits; we need urgent funding to track sexually transmitted diseases in elderly populations and get transmission under control before we have to put facilities like this one in CoiTUS Lockdown Level 5."

2. "Boom boom boom boom, I want you in my room," sings resident @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, thrusting his hips to the rhythm and winking at you erratically. "It's free love, baby, so don't be a square. I don't see anything wrong with a little bit of bump and grind, but I could use some variety. Maybe you could help fund buses between retirement homes for the occasional day trip." He makes a sharp U-turn to follow an eighty-year-old who just sashayed past you down the hallway.

3. "Old bodies pressed together — that's an image I don't need in my head," shudders student nurse @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "For the sake of decency and public health you should encourage old folk to satisfy their... urges... by doing something like knitting instead. In fact, staff who catch elderly folk doing the dirty should separate them immediately! Oh, and [i]please [/i]remember to wash your hands on the way out."

The Issue
The mid-service collapse of the roof of the Holy Sanctuary Assembly of @@FAITH@@, a venerable church in the east of @@CAPITAL@@, is merely the latest of a series of embarrassing incidents plaguing the oldest places of worship still standing in @@NAME@@. With rotting pews, disintegrating hymn books and undrinkable communion wine driving attendance down, a day you thought would be calming and quiet has been exchanged for a contentious and spirited debate at the site of the latest incident.

The Debate
1. "This incident underlines that we cannot postpone remedial works any longer," exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, bishop of the church in question. "An old chapel like this is not just a place to pray, you know. This was the work of skilled masons and architects, worshipping through the exceptional poise and grace of their hands. Watching it all fall to ruin... in truth, it has become unbearable. You must assign people and resources to protect and restore our oldest churches. Do you truly not fear the disappointment of the Almighty? Would it not be a terrible thing for someone of your standing to face eternal damnation?"

2. "Surely @@HE_1@@ can't be serious?" snickers @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@, wearing a shirt with 'Hope You Guessed My Name!' on the front. "These buildings are owned by the church, so why should it be the government's job to fix them? Is this a confession that @@FAITH@@ doesn't have any 'skilled masons' left who can chip in? Every single @@CURRENCY@@ wasted on this derelict barn is a @@CURRENCY@@ taken away from community services for the people that this bishop claims to be here to help, and the government needs to immediately return it to those services. If the bishop is so hellbent on renovating a pile of rubble, that's just @@HIS_1@@ cross to bear."

3. "This @MAN_2@@ has a point, but I doubt @@HE_2@@ understands why," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a notorious street preacher and protest leader. "A congregation is not a spectacle of glass and stone, nor any other kind of building. It is a group of people coming together, in the name of @@FAITH@@. Did you know that the earliest faithful had neither the freedom or finances to build a temple? They met, prayed and rejoiced together in the streets. When the authorities had no respect for their faith, they stood up for themselves, and even beat sense into people if they had to! It made them strong. So I say you should make our congregations get rid of every building and block of land we have — no real disciple ever needed air conditioning!"

The Issue
Self-declared whistleblower Luis Stoker has gone on a media tour across @@NAME@@ in the last week, sensationally claiming that your government is hiding proof of the existence of aliens in a top-secret military research facility. Stoker stirred up enough people that a parliamentary inquiry has ordered the contents of this facility be made public, and while it contains no aliens, this imperils the actual classified projects under development. You find yourself in a dark, cigar-smoke-filled room, with the few officials in the know about the true contents of the base.

The Debate
1. "There's nothing much we can really do here," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Chief of Staff, while fiddling with @@HIS@@ lighter. "We're legally obligated to obey parliament and disclose what we've been working on in there. It'll hurt the armed forces, but if that is the will of our constituents, then we have to respect it. We're here to serve them, after all!"

2. "No. Absolutely not. We are NOT going to just let this crackpot destroy years of hard work!" coughs Secretary of Defence @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has never smoked before today. "If the next generation aircraft we're developing at that base are exposed, it'll destroy the domestic defence sector! Blackacre will have a half-price knock-off available in less than three years, and there go all the export deals that make it worth the investment in the first place! All that money wasted, and we won't even have an advantage anymore. Hide everything and lie through your teeth."

3. "You know, better educated people are far less likely to believe in conspiracy theories," rumbles Air Chief Marshal @@RANDOM_NAME@@ between puffs of @@HIS@@ own cigar. "The number of recruits who get assigned to that base and expect to see aliens is embarrassing... you'd think dropping out was a pre-requisite for being First! Sure, we have to give specialist training if we want to turn someone into an effective technician, but we shouldn't have to explain how a light switch works. Just issue an executive order stating that parliament can't override national security, and then finance widespread secondary education programs, so our population doesn't fall for this kind of crap again."

4. "I think we're all assuming that this is much more dangerous than it really is," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Director of Intelligence, after a long drag. "I'd say there's actually an opportunity here. If the public loves the idea of space-age weaponry so much, announce that we're actually trying to develop it! Then use their excitement to tax their pants off, and give the money to our research programs. Who in their right mind will mess with our navy if our next frigate has a gigawatt death ray?"

The Issue
The Perpetual Lotion Company has bartered an unusual deal with East Lebatuck. There is a high demand among the East Lebatuckese people for the company's personal hygiene products, but recent sanctions have rendered East Lebatuck's currency worthless internationally. As a different method of payment was needed, the parties agreed to trade many millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ of product for a fleet of old warships including 13 submarines, 5 cruisers, 2 destroyers, an aircraft carrier, and an uncharacteristically menacing tugboat.

The Debate
1. "A private company simply cannot be allowed to own warships," begins your Secretary of State, @RANDOM_NAME@@, while looking over a detailed report of the trade. "It doesn't matter that these old warships were likely headed to the scrapyard. Do you really trust the East Lebatuckese demilitarization protocols? No, between the possibility of active ordnance and the company taking hostile takeovers too literally, it is clear the government must put an end to this and seize these ships."

2. "This is between us and the East Lebatuckese government," chastises the representative from Perpetual Lotion while leafing through a catalog of military hardware. "A customer wanted a product and had something of value to trade in return. Simple as that. Frankly, we've done more to disarm East Lebatuck with this deal than @@NAME@@ has in twenty years! If you are that concerned about the safety of the equipment, by all means come inspect it and disarm the equipment as necessary. Not that it matters; we're probably going to sell them to a scrapyard anyway. Maybe keep a ship or two for promotions. We'll play it by ear."

3. "Whoa-ho-ho there!" snipes an older, bearded gentleman decked out in camouflage. "They shouldn't scrap those ships, and by God, they absolutely shouldn't hand them over to the gubment. Oh sure, when @@LEADER@@ wants to stock up on cutting-edge killing machines, it's all hunky-dory, but when a company makes a perfectly legal trade for some well-worn ships, the Man loses his mind! Every company should be allowed to maintain a standing army if that's what they aim to do. No inspections, no restrictions. They have to be allowed to protect their own interests, whatever that entails."

The Issue
Politician Dick Wiper sent explicit photos of himself to a person he met on dating app Pumpr. Those photos were used to blackmail him into sharing the contact details of other politicians, who were then subjected to a spear-phishing campaign. After reviewing the evidence, your advisors are now hot and bothered about these targeted internet scams.

The Debate
1. "Well, that's a giant cock-up!" ejaculates your Minister of War, Maximus Johnson, as he finishes polishing his helmet. "Blackacre is behind this, no doubt! They're always breaching our security, trying to penetrate us by the back entrance. Well, I say we take the fight to them! We need to whip out our hidden weapon. With the help of our Big Unit supercomputer, our cyber warfare division has been developing a powerful new malware package that can give even the most potent enemy hardware a case of the blue screens. We need to insert this package into every possible opening we can find, and give them a pounding they'll never forget!"

2. "I think you're premature in coming to that conclusion," blurts out your Chief of Staff, Shona Biggin, whilst delicately using a tissue to wipe the minister's spittle from her face. "It's just a little spoof, more likely from a hardened member of a criminal syndicate than from a Blackacrean operative, but we'll never know for sure. We should have mandatory internet safety courses for all politicians so we can avoid these situations in the future."

3. "You're not going deep enough," moans Kat Fisher, Minister for Technology. "We need to handle the root of the problem — fake online profiles — in a manner that protects all citizens, not just politicians. Only the other day I was on FurryBabes.ns, a website for cute little animals. I was chatting to a darling little puppy. We agreed to meet. The little avatar was so sweet, I couldn't resist. Imagine my shock when she turned up on my doorstep — and she was a man! How was I to know it was a 'fursona'? We should make it a crime to represent yourself online as something you're not."

4. "The problem is technology," gasps Fanny Ryder, Minister for Rural Affairs, whose constituents are known for ploughing long into the night. "Everyone is looking for instant gratification. We don't need — what are those vibrating gadgets called? — smart phones. We should ban them. And computers. Let's get those stimulating, slow-paced encounters back, where we communicated by letters, or community notice boards."

"I've been organizing this clutter all day, but I can still hardly reach your desk without tripping over a radio or case of grenades.

Just hand them off to our friends; it's better if they explode during actual use than when I drop something on my foot again."

"If we give it all away, then the foreigners will reverse-engineer our technology, copy it, and KILL US ALL! For the sake of national security, we must BURN EVERYTHING!"

Mass protests have erupted outside the National Museum of Science and History in response to a new exhibit on an event known as the Smalltopian Genocide, in which numerous @@DEMONYM@@ were killed.

Facing calls for removal of both the exhibit and himself, the Museum"s director, @@RANDOMNAME1@@, has come to your administration for help responding to the situation.

The Debate
1. "While I agree that there"s a problem, I cannot agree with abandoning this exhibition altogether," opines your Minister of Moderate Solutions, pantomiming tossing an artifact over their shoulder. "The public isn"t angry about the actual exhibit artifacts; what they really want is to hear that the museum shares their sense of moral outrage. Let"s help the museum craft strong condemnations, wishes for such a tragic event to never happen again, trigger warnings, the whole shebang! That way we can preserve history, while still maintaining the public"s trust!"

2. "This is a travesty!" hollers protestor @@RANDOMNAME@@, unsuccessfully attempting to ignite a Smalltopian flag. "The Smalltopian Genocide is one of the most tragic events the world has ever faced, and my great grandpappy was one of its victims! It"s disgraceful for any institution, let alone a museum, to showcase its tools of destruction without leveling suitable criticism. You need to listen to the public on this one, @@LEADER@@; this exhibit should be taken down, and those responsible must be sacked!"

3. "I"m sorry, has everyone else gone insane?" clamors the ever-frustrated Director @@RANDOMLASTNAME1@@.

4. "I, for one, don"t see what has everyone"s knickers in a bunch," says a well-dressed man you"ve never seen before, with a mildly unsettling smile. "The former regime in Smalltopia was one of glory, back when the righteous were in power and made others bend to their will. Much better than what we see these days.

Significant media attention has fixated on an unprecedented legal battle in @@CAPITAL@@, as a woman has sued the anonymous sperm donor of her infant girl. The mother, known only as Miss @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, claims that the donor, a man named Mr Mr @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_2@@, has a legal obligation to financially support their child.

The Debate
1. "I think it"s high time we hold sperm donors accountable for the babies they help create," reflects child psychologist Ula deJong. "It"s not just about providing financial support, but also about the emotional and psychological impact on the newborn and their mother. It"s only fair that they know who their biological father is and have him involved in their life. We should pass legislation to make this happen and provide clear guidelines for enforcement, promoting a more responsible and compassionate society that values every human life."

2. "He did exactly what was asked of him — let him have his peace of mind without the burden of fatherhood," counters Brian Laine, an aging law professor. "Retroactively adjusting donorship contracts now to force arbitrary family relationships is preposterously unfair, and youth don"t need the complications that come with a biological father who has no desire to be a part of their lives. So, no, I don"t think "donor dads" should have any responsibilities or involvement. The defendant, and all other sperm donors, should be legally entitled to absolute anonymity."

3. "Listen @@LEADER@@, sperm donorship responsibility is a single tree in a big forest," interrupts Hana Ryan, a no-nonsense pre-school teacher. "We need to make sure that our society is set up so that people can actually take care of their children without having to sacrifice their own well-being. That means providing more welfare programs, more affordable healthcare, and more support for single parents. Until we do that, we"re just asking people to make impossible choices and then wondering why they"re not stepping up to the plate. The government needs to provide the support that families need, so that everyone can focus on what really matters — raising happy, healthy kids."

However, @@HE_1@@ claims that the word in question is actually one of the most common words in the Dàguó language, which sounds extremely similar to the slur.

The Debate
1. "I"m being disgraced just for doing my job!" exclaims the former professor, gesticulating wildly. "The slur is unacceptable because of how it has been used to hurt others, but the unrelated, innocently translating Dàguó word has no such history. It"s a ubiquitous filler word like "um", and yet some inconsiderate student, who — mind you — didn"t even listen to me explain the difference, marched right on up to the dean and managed to get me fired! If you don"t make a public statement defending me, you"ll get a solid F in my book."

2. "This @@MAN@@ is clearly a racist!" proclaims @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ college student @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@, who visits the dean"s office more often than some of @@HIS_2@@ classes. "I understand using the Dàguó word sparingly in context, but @@HE_1@@ obviously knew how it sounded, and repeating it so many times was just using the Dàguó language as a veneer for @@HIS_1@@ actual racism. @@ANIMAL_INITIALS@@CU"s decision to terminate @@HIS_1@@ employment was a good start, but known racists should be placed on an employment blacklist to better prevent these incidents in the future."

3. "This wouldn"t be a problem if @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ had more exposure to the Dàguó language," asserts @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the professor"s proud Dàguó mother. "If you subsidize Little Dàguós in cities around the country, people would hear the word contextualized in broader Dàguó culture, making the difference more widely known and helping to prevent our language from being stigmatized." She hands you a cookie filled with fluffy cream. "Here, this is for you."

4. "Beats me why Dagwos are even here," remarks your portly brother, finally emerging from the washroom after 45 minutes. "We could save a lot of time by just booting all those filthy ethnic people out of our @@TYPE@@ and shutting our borders to them. No more minorities, no more misunderstandings. Besides, all they do is steal our jobs and take up valuable living space. And what if one is a spy sent by the Dagwo government to start a coup? If I lose my state-funded mansion, I"m blaming you."

5. "Beats me why Dagwos are even here," remarks your portly brother, finally emerging from the washroom after 45 minutes. "We could save a lot of time by just booting any remaining non-@@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ out of our @@TYPE@@ and doubling down on border security. No more minorities, no more misunderstandings. Besides, we all know they"re responsible for everything wrong with the nation, and if I lose my state-funded mansion because one of them stages a coup, I"m blaming you."
