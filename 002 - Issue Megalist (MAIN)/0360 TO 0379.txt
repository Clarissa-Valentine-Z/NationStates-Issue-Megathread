[b][anchor=360]#360[/anchor]: Electile Dysfunction [Christian Democrats; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Stung by an extensive exposé in The @@CAPITAL@@ Tattler of faulty and corrupt elections processes, certain Members of Parliament are loudly demanding that the Electoral Commission of @@NAME@@ revisit the current voting system.

The Debate
1. "What's wrong with a plurality voting system?" rhetorically questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Count the votes, and the candidate with the most wins. It's the simplest and cheapest methodology, and it creates a stable two-party system without any radicals wasting Parliament's precious time. What more could you want? And..." the MP leans forward and continues in a hushed tone, "It's the best way to ensure our party stays in power indefinitely."

2. "Our current electoral system needs only a little tweaking," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a member of the Electoral Commission. "Why don't we adopt instant-runoff voting? That way people can vote for their favorite candidates plus their second and third choices without worrying whether they're mainstream enough. We'll need to hire a few more people at the Electoral Commission to tally the rounds of votes, but honestly I don't see that as a problem."

3. "Now is the time to completely overhaul the electoral system!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chairperson of a single-issue political party dedicated to legalizing @@ANIMAL@@ wrestling. "We need proportional representation now! If we adopt party-list proportional representation with open lists, political minorities will gain seats relative to the popular vote and actually have a voice. The centrists have dictated government policy for too long; let the political fringes speak!"

4. "You're missing the whole point of democracy," argues a strange woman wearing a toga. "Democracy is about equality! The best system of representation is sortition. Go back to the ancient way of doing things and pick representatives from among the common citizens through allotment. People who run for political office are usually untrustworthy and power-hungry. Randomly-selected citizens will make far better decisions than greedy politicians, even if they're a little incompetent. Lottocracy all the way!"

5. "Or we could just do away with this populist sham," sneers Sir @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a landed gentleman. "Do the teeming masses really need to complicate our lives? Institute a steep poll tax to keep workers from voting, and we won't be troubled by the greedy plebeians and their insatiable desire for more welfare. Cut the entire welfare budget while you're at it, and respectable people like us can have a nice tax cut."

[b][anchor=361]#361[/anchor]: @@CAPITAL@@, We Have A Problem [Luna Amore; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
Early this morning, the Space Shuttle Maxcelsior suffered serious damage from an explosion of unknown causes. The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Aeronautics and Space Administration is divided as to what to do.

The Debate
1. "We're going to take a hit on this no matter what", your Press Secretary moans morosely. "The more news cycles this one takes up, the worse we're going to look. Tell @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE_INITIALS@@ASA to get our boys back on the ground NOW. They're going to whine about pushing safety margins to the limit, but there's always going to be a risk! Those space cowboys knew that when they signed on. We're simply out of options, @@LEADER@@."

2. "We most certainly are not out of options", counters the mission's Flight Director, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We have no idea how much damage that explosion caused. There's a very good chance it blew right through the heat shield. If that happened, and they try to come back without fixing it, they'll be toast. I know for a fact that the military has been working on a quick-launch low-Earth orbiter. If we refit it as a rescue vehicle and launch now, we can have them down safely by the weekend."

3. "Are you out of your mind!?" screams Major General @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while taking a swing at the Flight Director. "That spacecraft is top secret. Want me to slow it down for you? Top. Secret. You want to use it in a high-profile, never before done space rescue? Why don't we mail its damn blueprints to all our enemies! @@LEADER@@, it is imperative that we keep that craft a secret at all costs. God knows what the Bigtopians would do with it. As for the astronauts, let them find their own ride home. We're not the only country with a space program you know."

4. "You reap what you sow", chastises Reverend @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Tell me, what happened when the people of Babel tried to build a tower to God? He destroyed it and punished them. This shuttle is simply a modern day Tower of Babel in spades. You mocked God with your pride, tried to defile his celestial kingdom with your sinful machines, and now you will pay the price. Forget these lost souls, abandon the space program and repent your sins."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b][anchor=362]#362[/anchor]: After The Fall [Luna Amore; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
After re-entering the atmosphere yesterday, the Space Shuttle Maxcelsior suffered catastrophic manoeuvring damage and slammed - almost intact - into the coastal city Cape @@NAME@@. The kinetic strike centered on the regional oil depot near the waterfront tourist district; the resulting fireball incinerated huge segments of residential housing. Survivors are looking to you for answers.

The Debate
1. "The city is a warzone!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the city's Mayor. "Bodies lining the streets, buildings collapsing – it's an inferno! People are clamouring for security and our emergency services are overwhelmed. We could never have prepared for something of this magnitude! There's no hope of rebuilding or maintaining order without government help. @@LEADER@@, you must send all the emergency services and aid you can. People are dying!"

2. "It damn well is a warzone", agrees your top military advisor, General @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We can't send in emergency services until the area is stabilized. We need a strong military presence and fast. Declare martial law over the city and send in a regiment of soldiers. We'll secure the area and get people calmed down. After it's contained to my liking, you can send in civilian aid, but even then my men aren't leaving until that city is on its way to repair."

3. "Woah, hold up a second", interrupts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Director of @@NAME@@'s Emergency Preparedness Agency while nervously wringing a fire-safety pamphlet. "We don't have a contingency for something this massive. There's far too many variables for us to safely do anything. This city has local services, right? Well, let them handle the brunt of it. After they've cleaned up a bit and once their people have calmed the hell down, then we'll work our way in slowly from the outlying areas. Trust me, President @@RANDOM_NAME@@, this isn't the time to go running around playing hero. The cost in lives and tax @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ would be too high."

[b][anchor=363]#363[/anchor]: The Apotheosis of @@LEADER@@? [The tovian way; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
A period of unprecedented peace and prosperity in @@NAME@@ has seen your personal approval rate sky-rocket. Recently, a small but growing movement has emerged claiming that these general good times are the result of your divine favour, and are advocating that the people worship you as a god.

The Debate
1. "All hail the glorious @@LEADER@@, giver of safety and wealth!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Prefect of the Cult of Divine Nationalism from atop a wooden crate in @@CAPITAL@@ Grand Plaza. "Are not the might and benevolence of the holy @@LEADER@@ manifest for all to see? Should we not respond in humble worship? Proclaim your divinity before all, O Great One, and your people shall listen!"

2. "This is heresy!" pontificates @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a high-ranking clergywoman of @@RELIGION@@, while proffering a collection plate. "Surely you can't seriously be entertaining delusions of divinity? You would undoubtedly bring divine wrath upon us! I urge you, speak out against these wayward souls and endorse the teachings of our holy writ as the true path to righteousness. Only then can we be assured of continued providence."

3. "Let's not be too hasty now, there may be an opportunity in this," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your shrewdest political advisors. "Of course you're not divine, we both know that, but is there really any harm in letting these whack-jobs think you are? Nothing begets obedience like the command of one's god, after all. Perhaps a carefully constructed public statement is in order, one that gives legitimacy to these people's beliefs while avoiding claiming divinity outright. Let people read into it what they want, and if they flock to this 'religion' in droves, well, would it really be so terrible if a large percentage of @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ became your devoted disciples?

4. "Bah! Ridiculous gobbledygook, all of it!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, controversial atheist author of the book 'Atoms in Space and Relations Between Them - An Exhaustive Account of Existence'. "These cultists are no crazier than any other religious types, and have done far less damage than some I might mention. Take this opportunity to disavow all religion as superstitious nonsense, and throw your support behind reason instead. It's the perfect opportunity to end the tax breaks for people with imaginary friends, and funnel that additional money into the areas it can do some real good, like authors of popular science books!"

5. "All hail our glorious @@LEADER@@... or face eternal punishment!" shouts a wide-eyed bearded man in sack cloth waving a greasy tract. "Pay no heed to these sectarians, my liege, they have departed from the way of truth! Only we, of the Cult of Nationalist Divinity, have remained faithful in the face of their slanderous impiety. We know you to be an uncompromising and demanding god, intolerant of all false doctrine. We stand ready to convert the masses to your worship, by force if necessary! Starting, of course, with the insufferable heretics of the Cult of Divine Nationalism!"

[b][anchor=364]#364[/anchor]: It's UterUs, not UterYou! [Ranbo; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
A religious talk show host raised a furor with his call to ban contraception. Women's rights groups have come to you demanding a response.

The Debate
1. "I'm appalled these religious wackos have the gall to even think about banning birth control," @@RANDOM_NAME@@ says to you. "These men are trying to control our bodies. They treat us like we're their own personal baby dispensers — not living, thinking humans. It's demeaning! My body, my choice!"

2. "You aren't going to listen to these pagans," scoffs Archbishop @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Conceiving a child is one of the most enjoyable moments one may ever have in their lives. To deprive yourself of this blessing of God is an abomination! Contraception must be outlawed! It encourages casual sex, and destroys the true meaning of the act. If people are not willing to bear the consequences of their actions, then they should not act at all."

3. "Both sides have rocks in their brains," says proud asexual, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why don't we just ban sex altogether, and force people to use artificial insemination? That way, we can preview everyone who signs up to have kids, and if we don't like it, tough beans for them. The police may have to work harder to catch those who 'overlook' this measure, but if that's the price we have to pay for ending this inane argument once and for all, it'll be well worth it."

[b][anchor=365]#365[/anchor]: A Busload of Worry [Panageadom; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
An advertisement battle over the morality and acceptability of "coming out of the closet" is taking place on @@CAPITAL@@'s buses, with different factions presenting their vehement cases on these moving billboards. Groups on all sides are demanding the government step in, soothe egos, and take action.

The Debate
1. "This is disgusting, and I shouldn't have to see it," pines prominent homosexual, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, for once abandoning stereotype to be seen without feather boa, "@@NAME@@ should be a nation intolerant of intolerance, and what could be more intolerant than this? Have you any idea what damage this fundamentalist advertisement will do to young people struggling to come to terms with their sexuality? We should ban this ad, and instead educate children to be free about their sexual preference, without deference to religious or cultural orthodoxy."

*2. "This is disgusting, and I shouldn't have to see it," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@ a particularly prudish representative of @@FAITH@@. "Have we forgotten that @@NAME@@ is a country founded on traditional values, not least the sanctity of the relationship between man and woman? These deviants have no respect for what is natural and are spreading a sickness through my country, so I have a god-given right to educate the people about it. I say we ought to ban these LGBwhatever posters and divert some government funds to reminding the people of @@NAME@@ what it truly means to be a virtuous soul!" [[color=purple]High Religiousness[/color]]

*3. “This is disgusting, and I shouldn’t have to see it,” declares Ashurbanipal Hester, a particularly prudish citizen who seems to be concealing a small holy symbol. “Have we forgotten that @@NAME@@ once respected traditional values, not least the sanctity of the relationship between man and woman? These deviants have no respect for what is natural and are spreading a sickness through my country, so I have the right – nay, the responsibility — to educate the people about it. I say we ought to ban these LGBwhatever posters and divert some government funds to reminding the people of @@NAME@@ what it truly means to be virtuous souls!” [[color=purple]Low Religiousness[/color]]

4. "Last I checked, free speech meant listening to people you didn't like," yawns your advisor, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, slouched over a sofa with a newspaper over his face. "A principle your office seems utterly devoted to... Look. Should a bunch of bigoted nutjobs stop homosexuals from saying it's alright for Jim and Jones to hold hands in the street? Of course not. Equally, should a bunch of tarted-up fruits stop reactionaries from banging on about their beliefs? Obviously no. So why stop either of them? Freedom of expression is more important than either party's sensibilities, no matter how distasteful that might be."

5. "This whole culture is foul, and we shouldn't perpetuate it," argues daily commuter, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "Surely the point of public transportation is to quickly get people to work or wherever, not to bombard them with fringe political causes. We should do away with advertising on government services and properties altogether, as well as pour some more money into our public transportation network. Then @@CAPITAL@@ would have the best transport in the world."

[b][anchor=366]#366[/anchor]: Prosecute Stolen Valour, Says Military [The sky city of columbia; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
General officers in the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Armed Forces are requesting the criminalisation of "stolen valour" - the impersonation of decorated service members, often with the motive of financial gain.

The Debate
1. "These traitorous cowards need to be prosecuted!" says red-faced Vice Admiral @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while puffing out his chest, proudly showing off his own service medals. "They demean the heroic actions of veterans who did actually earn the medals, and desecrate the memory of those who died in service of @@NAME@@. I know what my boys would do to these charlatans if they caught them, and I can't promise I'd intervene! I'd like to see these pretenders try to earn the medals they want to show off. Actually, let's do that - send all these fraudsters to the front line. That'll teach them."

*2. "It is the right of all citizens to express themselves in any way they chose," claims free speech advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while wearing a t-shirt that calls you a rather crude obscenity. "People should be free to dress in any uniform without fear of reprisal or punishment - and that includes wearing a uniform of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE_INITIALS@@AF. What better way to display to the world one's patriotism! And if you happen to get more respect or some discounts because of it, all the better. If that argument doesn't persuade you, then maybe you should ask the Vice Admiral how he won those medals. You can bet your bottom @@CURRENCY@@ that if you criminalise this, concerned citizens will start asking serving officers that question. Do you want the military to have another public relations disaster?" [[color=red]Must not have media[/color] OR [color=red]Must have Autocracy[/color]]

**3. "Why do we celebrate and glorify warmongering by raising these conquistadors above everyone else?" questions Conan Svensson, an anti-war protester outside the gates of your office building. "These medals and uniforms only exist to exert dominance and fear over the masses. The military claim these medals are rewards, but they are actually trophies declaring to the world how many innocent civilians their brainwashed killers massacred. We should do away with our armed forces and imprison those who supposedly kill in the name of @@NAME@@." [[color=blue]Must not have conscription[/color]]

[b][anchor=367]#367[/anchor]: What's Their Beef? [Nouvel Ecosse; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
After @@ANIMAL@@ meat was found in the popular beef lasagne sold by supermarket Humongo-Mart, a scandal has erupted over lax food safety standards.

The Debate
1. "What we've got here," lectures Health and Safety Inspector-General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "is failure to regulate. The fact that these lasagnes have been contaminated for so long proves that we have been far too lenient on food processing companies. I demand more tests!"

2. "You're forgetting the source of Humongo-Mart's meat," cautions @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Agricultural Union representative @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "How can we possibly know what they get up to in those shady Lilliputian abattoirs? Rather than waste time sorting out the dog's dinner your government has made of food safety regulations, all we need to solve this problem is a simple import ban on foreign meats."

3. "We must do more," whispers leading zoologist and TV documentary host @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while surrounded by wild @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@. "These creatures are national treasures, just like me, and thus should be cherished, not consumed. I say ban all products that use animal meat!"

4. "I don't thee what thith meth ith all about," says morbidly obese @@RANDOM_NAME@@ through a mouthful of said lasagne generously donated to her by Humongo-Mart. "It'th only popular becauthe of the @@ANIMAL@@ in it. Nobody wath complaining before, in fact people were lining up in droveth to buy it. I thay we allow the uthe of thith meat in our foodth.

[b][anchor=368]#368[/anchor]: Female Workers Feeling The Pinch [Relana; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
A group of concerned women have complained about rising levels of harassment from male colleagues.

The Debate
1."I can't get through a day without a male co-worker slapping me on the behind or wolf whistling as I walk to the coffee machine," protests generously-endowed receptionist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "This has to stop. Men who display this sort of behaviour should be fired immediately." 

2. "Give us a break honey," says office lothario @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ while ogling your secretary. "A cheeky pinch or admiring glance never hurt anyone. These chicks should stop complaining - it's all a bit of harmless fun." 

3. "In the good old days, this wouldn't have been an issue," harrumphs @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, sat in the corner. "Our women stayed home and took care of the kids. No wonder the country's going to pot. It's time to put them back in their place and stop this feminine charade."

4. "It's time to face the facts, @@LEADER@@," announces square-jawed @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, as she kicks your door down. "Men have had their chance, and look at the mess they've made. Put the women in charge, and then we'll surely see an end to harassment."

[b][anchor=369]#369[/anchor]: No Vocation Without Remuneration [Nation of Quebec; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Labor organizations are outraged by the practice of unpaid internships following the death of a student intern who worked hundred-hour weeks, desperately trying to get ahead in the finance industry. The unions are demanding the end of unpaid employment.

The Debate
1."I can't believe the government is allowing this barbaric practice to continue in @@NAME@@!" shouts student union leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@ into a megaphone. "We work long hours doing tedious work for no pay. It's pure corporate exploitation. I'd hardly call alphabetizing papers or washing a CEO's feet valuable work experience. The government must put an end to this horrendous scam!"

2. "You can't seriously be considering this nonsense?" gasps @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ CEO @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ as he plucks grapes from a silver platter held by a disgruntled female intern. "We provide our sla- I mean interns with the most glamorous work that the industry has to offer. They are a great asset to our company. Sure, they might not get paid, but we offer them valuable work experience that they can't get anywhere else. And if they work hard, we even give them a reference. What's wrong with that?"

3. "Why bother with internships at all?" muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an economics advisor, while lazily checking stock options. "The real solution would be to abolish the minimum wage and allow each company to set their own standards. Then you'll see what jobs are really worth in @@NAME@@. Without wage and labor restrictions, workers can freely find a workplace that offers better pay, and dumb loopholes like internships and worker's comp will be a thing of the past."

4. "MORE deregulation?" snaps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your student intern, for once taking a break from filing your papers. "As if @@NAME@@ wasn't capitalist enough. Fixing economic exploitation is going to take a lot more than outlawing internships. Stop the bourgeoisie from leeching off of everyone's labor, and us workers could finally go to work knowing our hours of toil were actually building society. If you cared about anyone besides the rich, you'd nationalize the economy post-haste."

The Issue
After the sudden withdrawal of a large portion of the government's budget led to the overnight collapse of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ economy, panicked - and now jobless - bureaucrats have flocked to your office demanding a swift U-turn in government policy.

The Debate
1. "Yes! Re-institute the subsidies," implores former civil servant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, searching behind your desk for loose change. "If we act now, there's still a chance we can raise the money needed to save our economy - and my career!"

2. "You've got to be kidding me," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head - and last remaining employee - of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Revenue Agency, recently voted most popular person in @@NAME@@. "Did you see the look on our citizens' faces when we slashed taxes? Give them even more control over their economic futures, and the economy will surely recover in time."

3. "The ECONOMY has collapsed?!?" splutters a near-hysterical @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You need some perspective - our entire public sector has been devastated overnight! Millions left destitute, without education, healthcare or pensions. Rather than cosying up to business again, we urgently need a restoration of the welfare budgets you callously axed!"

[b][anchor=371]#371[/anchor]: Lotto Fever [Nation of Quebec; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Your ever-enterprising brother was recently arrested for running a surprisingly large numbers racket; the earnings allowed him to purchase several foreign luxury cars. Your advisers, surprised by gambling's potential profitability, have begun debating the possibility of a National Lottery to raise government funds. The idea has drawn fire from social groups, who have come to warn you of the evils of gambling.

The Debate
1. "A National Lottery would be a great idea," says your money-obsessed Minister of Finance, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "This is just what the economy needs. Everybody is attracted to the idea of becoming a millionaire overnight. And best of all, this is as close as you can get to taxing the poor without actually calling it that! That surplus could even subsidize our struggling strategic basket weaving sector. A government-owned lottery would permit small games of chance while keeping out the sleazy, parasitic casinos."

2. "A gambling ban is essential to the moral fibre of the nation," counters social worker, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing a t-shirt with the slogan 'Don't be a Fool; Gambling's not Cool'. "Gambling addiction causes countless broken homes abroad, and having a national lottery would only introduce the problem into @@NAME@@. For the sake of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ families, we MUST stand firm against the sin of gambling!"

*3. A man sporting a ten-gallon cowboy hat rolls in an impressive scale model of a casino city, complete with a flashing neon light display. "Well howdy folks! I couldn't help but overhear that your gambling industry is in the toilet. Why not hand over the new lottery to the private sector? I have a plan to use that lottery money to create massive casino cities. I've built casinos in Maxtopia, Bigtopia, and North Lilliputia and by gum, it put them on the map! Just think of all the tourists who will flock to @@NAME@@: The Gambling Center of @@REGION@@!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. A man sporting a ten-gallon cowboy hat rolls in an impressive scale model of a casino city, complete with a flashing neon light display. "Well howdy folks! I couldn't help but overhear that your gambling industry is in the toilet. That's the problem with you commies: you don't know how to generate a profit. Why not allow the private sector back into your nation's economy and celebrate that with turning over the lottery to my company? I have a plan to use that lottery money to create massive casino cities. I've built casinos in Maxtopia, Bigtopia, and North Lilliputia and by gum, it put them on the map! Just think of all the tourists who will flock to @@NAME@@: The Gambling Center of @@REGION@@!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

5. "And why are we letting some guy with a ridiculous hat profit from this new industry?" exclaims your brother, who was not invited to this meeting. "We'd be much better off with a government monopoly of all gambling institutions, so the profits don't all end up in that foreigner's bank account. But instead of wasting that sweet, sweet lolly on a basketcase subsidization plan, imagine the fun WE could have. You know, for a world leader, your digs are kinda shabby. What's say we use that gambling money for your own personal pleasure palace? It would be all for you. And family of course."

[b][anchor=372]#372[/anchor]: The Coming of the Commissars [Baiynistan; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Controversy arose recently when an entire platoon deserted because they "just didn't see the point of it all". As a consequence, debate has erupted over ways to rebuild Revolutionary spirit in the army.

The Debate
1. "The answer is simple, Leader," confidently states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Party ideologue. "Our servicemen and women need to know what they're fighting for: the Historical mission of @@NAME@@. It's absolutely imperative that we appoint political commissars to serve alongside regular officers and educate our brave soldiers about Worldwide Revolution. Ideological training is as important as the ability to shoot straight, after all."

2. "No, no, no! That all sounds frightfully dull!" interrupts your wild-eyed and unkempt head of sciences, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You know what'll get young people lining up at every recruitment post? Flashy new gear! Who doesn't want to charge into battle as a combat engineer, dodging and weaving between @@ANIMAL@@ tanks, airships raining down support? Oh, and Tesla coils, gotta have Tesla coils. I admit the R&D will be INSANELY expensive, and I can't guarantee realization of all our schematics - especially the time machine side project - but hey, at least it'll solve the morale problem."

3. "Now hold on just a minute!" hollers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an unruly off-duty soldier. "We don't need some jumped-up Party mouthpiece telling us what to do! Present company excepted, of course, @@LEADER@@. And we don't need fancy gizmos to motivate us either. The real problem is the officer corps forcing us to fight all the time. War takes so much effort and somebody always ends up getting hurt. If we have the troops elect officers at every level - including the top brass - we won't be fighting pointless battles in the first place. After all, isn't workers' power what the Revolution is all about?"

4. "An entire platoon just DESERTED!" fumes former Gulag Welfare Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while visiting on diplomatic business, "And no one thinks they should be punished? In Glorious Motherland such treachery would never be tolerated," he continues, mindlessly toying with a pistol, "It sounds to me that you need some men following around your conscripts to make sure the cowards don't flee back to mommy. You don't want @@NAME@@ to become the laughingstock of the anticapitalist world."

[b][anchor=373]#373[/anchor]: Devil and the Deep Blue Funding Gap [New Vegas; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A group of scientists have come to your office hoping for grants to explore the deep blue sea.

The Debate
1. "Our lack of knowledge of the ocean is unacceptable!" lectures Jacques Zissou, Emeritus Professor of Marine Biology. "We know less about the ocean floor than we do the lunar surface. The dearth of research is absurd! Were the government to provide more funding, we could perform studies on marine life, underwater volcanoes, currents, and more. The possibilities are endless. Sure, it'll cost a pretty @@CURRENCY@@, but the dissertations will be enthralling."

2. "Oh sure, let's spend millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to find out what's in the ocean. Oh wait, I can already tell you: it's just WATER," your budget advisor remarks sarcastically. "There is no point in spending tax money to know what kind of dirt is on the ocean floor. The government should scrap all research projects designed without real economic benefit. The last thing @@NAME@@ needs is yet another harebrained scheme to study the mating habits of dolphins or something comparably ridiculous."

[b][anchor=374]#374[/anchor]: Lion Dad Sparks Child-Rearing Sentiment [Samuelica; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
The controversial book "Battle Hymn of the Lion Dad", which depicts a foreign-born father brutally raising his children to outperform their peers, has whipped up a great debate over parenting in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "Look at @@NAME@@'s children: fat, lazy, dumb, and unsuccessful," says the book's author @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@. "Now look at my two girls. Attending top colleges! Lawyer and doctor! Making a difference with their lives! Making good money with their lives! It takes iron discipline, regular beatings, and the sacrifice of their childhoods, and I might not remember their names every once in a while, but who cares about that when I can brag about my boys - I mean girls."

2. "Poor babies," wails concerned mother @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, clutching her teenage son tight to her bosom. "That book suggests the most awful punishments - hit our children, starve them, make them do their homework. The worst thing I ever did to my cupcake was give him a little gold star for trying his best. I suggest we ban this book and while we are at it, lengthen the school holidays so I can take my huggle-bug to Mr Happy's Funland again."

3. "It's not my fault," yawns exhausted warehouse operative and father of four @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, after returning from a double shift, "All I ever learned at school was how to calculate a hypotenuse and how an oxbow lake is formed. Why not teach young @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ some useful life skills like raising kids, getting a job, and coping with the daily grind of life? It's all they have to look forward to, after all." He immediately falls asleep on the couch.

4. "Lion dad?" queries @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, grasping his young son under one arm, while feeding a ferocious @@ANIMAL@@ from the other. "That's actually just what our kids need these days - a taste of the wild. All newborn children should be left in the wilderness to fend for themselves. The strong and resourceful will survive to better our nation, and the weak... well at least the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ won't go hungry."

The Issue
The sudden appearance of a bouquet of rainbows in the skies above @@CAPITAL@@ has bedazzled the city's natives. Initial investigations by amateur scientists have revealed the source of the phenomena to be a previously undiscovered ancient barrow just outside the city limits, apparently teeming with hoards of gold. Efforts to procure the gold, however, have been in vain, with rumours that mysterious men of a limited stature are mischievously playing tricks on would-be treasure hunters.

The Debate
1. "This is spectacular", squeals @@RANDOM_NAME@@, presenter of popular entertainment show 'Us Nightly'. "All this GOLD for FREE! I can think of a thousand ways to spend it all. So what if there are a few weird dwarves - we could use all of this gold to fund the national budget! Let's blow that ditch to hell, grab the loot, and go on a shopping spree!"

2. "Gold? Dwarves? Rainbows? This is a travesty!" decrees @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an infamous mendicant preacher who wandered into a live report on the lunchtime news. "These are no mere dwarves - these are leprechauns; demons sent here to deceive us! They are wicked, sinful tricksters, who have become manifest because of our tolerance of ancient pagan burial grounds on our sacred and holy lands. We must purge these abominations and destroy all that which is connected to this Plague; the leprechauns, their evil gold, and that unholy barrow!"

3. "Top o' the morning to you laddie!" says Patrick O'Malley, a twinkley-eyed leprechaun, all clad in green. "Ara, let's not be talking about blowing up this and blowing up that. Sure we'd just love to be friends, you and I and us. Now look a chara, how's about we come to a wee deal, aye? We'll swap some of our lucky Irish gold for a couple o'drops to drink. We do be dying of the thirst and wouldn't say no to an aul whiskey or two ... dozen. Just between us, mind! Our wee secret."

[b][anchor=376]#376[/anchor]: Death by Bungee [Canckaland; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
The @@CAPITAL@@ Times recently reported that @@NAME@@ leads @@REGION@@ in deaths from bungee jumping. In response, a handful of advocates have petitioned your office to remedy the unusual situation.

The Debate
1. "Bungee jumping is all good fun," says Bunga Bunga Bungee Business Bund Bigwig Bernard Bungalow. "It would be criminal to criminalize such a rewarding, family-friendly activity. All the members of my organization have stellar records of safety, unlike the fools at Bungee Bonanza. I mean come on, what kind of idiot uses a 50 meter bungee for a 30 meter cliff? So to distance reputable businessmen from their corner-cutting counterparts, the government should publish a list of accredited bungee institutions to help jumpers to make informed choices."

2. "Bungee jumping is insane," argues @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who always wears a helmet, just in case. "My cousin split his head open while bungee jumping. Our entire family was devastated. The only reasonable solution is to ban dangerous activities like bungee jumping, skydiving, oh - and anything involving scissors." Sipping from a glass of pasteurized water, he continues, "Some people may complain it's ruining their fun, but as I like to tell them, it's hard to have fun when you're dead, eh!"

3. "Let's not cry over spilt milk," says funeral home director @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, rubbing her hands with barely-disguised glee. "As for the few deaths, at least they perished doing something they enjoyed. To be honest, I don't know why @@NAME@@ needs all these pansy safety regulations." She pushes a stack of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ towards you. "Let them go splat!"

[b][anchor=377]#377[/anchor]: It's A Bird! It's A Plane! No, It's... Oh, It Was A Plane [SalusaSecondus; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A military courier, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, rushes into your office in a panic, "@@LEADER@@, there's been a terrible tragedy! We mistook a civilian aircraft for an attack bomber and launched an anti-aircraft missile at it. There are no survivors. What should we do?"

The Debate
1. "Blame the Bigtopians!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your most jingoistic advisor. "No one can really prove it was us. Pin it on our foes and prove to the world how monstrous they are. It's the perfect excuse to double-down on our military investments. How else can we possibly defend ourselves against such amoral villains?" 

2. "What did you expect to happen?" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leader of @@NAME@@ Against Arms. "You can hardly walk down the street without seeing a soldier on their front-porch polishing a surface-to-air missile. With all of these weapons in the government's hands, of course accidents are going to happen. The only way to prevent an awful war is to openly admit our mistake and massively cut back on the number of weapons in circulation. That will keep this tragedy from ever happening again." 

3. "How do we even know it was a civilian aircraft?" insinuates Chief Spy L------. "We could just quietly let the word out that it was actually a secret military aircraft sent in by the Bigtopians to spy on us, and no one could blame us for shooting it down. Clearly the numerous schoolchildren and nuns were just clever disguises meant to fool us." 

4. "Deny, deny, deny," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Deputy Minister of Information. "We didn't shoot down a plane because there was no plane. There are no corpses because no one was on the plane - which didn't exist anyway. Anyone who says otherwise is clearly just slandering the Glorious @@TYPE@@ of @@NAME@@."

[b][anchor=378]#378[/anchor]: The War To End All Wars [Golgothastan; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
It's the centenary of a great war that shook @@REGION@@, and competing plans to commemorate the historic moment are being considered for approval.

The Debate
1. "No expense must be spared!" shouts military historian @@RANDONMALENAME@@ through his unfashionable mustache. "This historic event must be celebrated through every town square in the country. Parades, street parties, reenactments! I'm sure all our citizens will contribute handsomely to making this celebration truly memorable."

2. "Excellent! And let's not stop with the past," proclaims Brigadier-General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Director of Public Outreach for the Army. "We can use this burst of patriotic fervor to give a strong message of support to today's armed forces, going forward. We should have a big parade of our men and women in uniform in @@CAPITAL@@ with a fly-by from the Air Force. We can never have too many recruits, after all."

3. "Do you have any idea how much all of that would cost?" complains budget auditor @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while eating a stale rice cracker for lunch. "We shouldn't spend money on something that happened a hundred years ago, and the savings from all that pomp and circumstance can be returned to the taxpayers. Are you going to eat that sandwich?"

4. "I don't mind having a commemoration, but we need to remember that most of the people who died in the Great War were common workers like me," says union leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who never seems to be content with anything. "I think it's only fair that we give everyone a national holiday, so we can all reflect upon our history of class oppression. Otherwise celebrations like this end up just being for you toffs."

5. "Of course we should remember the War - but there was nothing 'Great' about it!" pontificates student protester @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has read two and a half books about the War and now knows everything about it. "It was a shameful bloodbath caused by greedy capitalist arms manufacturers, and it could have been avoided. We should be remembering the incalculable tragedy of it all and making sure it never happens again!"

[b][anchor=379]#379[/anchor]: Stakes On A Plane [Juernsey; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
With global travel soaring, the country's primary airport, @@CAPITAL@@ International, has reached full capacity. Interested parties are queuing up to share their thoughts on what should be done.

The Debate
1. "We won't be 'International' for long without a capacity increase," laments Transport Minister @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ while wringing her hands. "If we want to remain a global hub, we need another runway and we need it now. We'll have to bulldoze a few houses to clear room, but just think of the @@CURRENCY@@ we'll make from all those passengers."

2. "Our quality of life is what matters," bellows nearby resident @@RANDOM_NAME@@ over the noise of a landing jet. "Why do we even want to be a hub, with all that noise and pollution? What we need is even stricter limits on planes flying over residential areas. And if that means a few planes have to land elsewhere, then much the better."

3. "There's no need to destroy people's lives just for a new runway", parries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Under-Secretary of State for Creative Solutions, "but nor do we need to turn planes away. Why not build an entirely new airport, in the Orilenyo Flow estuary? The planes can fly over the sea, and a bullet train can take passengers to the city centre. Everyone wins - well except for the local wildlife, but what's @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@ to you or me?"
