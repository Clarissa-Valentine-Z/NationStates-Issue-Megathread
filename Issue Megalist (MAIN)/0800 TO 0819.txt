[b][anchor=800]#800[/anchor]: Please Call 1-800-NTA-VRUS, Your Government May Be Compromised [Luna Amore; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue 
One of your interns unintentionally infected government computer networks after @@HE@@ called a 1-800 number on a popup and gave the scammer remote access to the computer. While IT tries to sort out the damage, your team is divided as to what to do about the situation.

The Debate
1. "It was a very convincing warning!" sobs the intern responsible who is feverishly resetting @@HIS@@ passwords to Passw0rD1. "I thought our national security was at stake! Why didn't our antivirus stop it? Why are we so vulnerable? Why am I the only one crying? We need to install better protection like the Fortons, Maxphos or McCafes. Better yet, all three!"

[2]. "I've been lobbying your administration about this for years," chastises Pear Inc CEO, Steve Tasks, dramatically sliding an ultra-thin tablet computer from a manila envelope onto your desk. "Your systems need a complete overhaul. Unlike those clunky UBM dinosaurs, Pear products never get a virus, with end-to-end protection provided by my company. Just gaze in awe at the Pearbook Vapor. See how sleek it is... And it’s so light and thin, you could take it anywhere. I hear Manamana's beaches are wonderful this time of year." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

[3]. "Government computers are not for looking up @@ANIMAL@@ memes," chastises Stafford Brewer, head of Distribution Cybernetics. "They're for allocating collective resources as efficiently as possible, scheduling party meetings and keeping tabs on counter-revolutionary behaviour! Rip out these decadent capitalist contraptions and install government networked terminals in every distribution hub across the country. We'll be more efficient, and safer, than ever." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "What codswallop!" exclaims your head of IT, @@RANDOMNAME@@, yanking an unencrypted USB drive from your computer. "Why go wasting millions of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ on a band-aid fix? Shiny new computers don't help if the problem is the idiot behind the keyboard. We need to lock down these machines. Every Sam, Dick and Martha intern should not have administrator rights on these machines. Lock them down."

5. "This scammer business has gone on long enough," growls military intelligence officer Colonel Flagg while sizing up everyone in the room. "They hide outside our borders in East Lebatuck taunting us with this bull hockey. Enough is enough! Give us the authorization and we'll smoke these bastards out at the source."

6. "Hello I am from UBM Technical support" chirrups a tinny voice as you answer your phone. "We have noticed that your system has multiple viruses on it and we are here to help. If you could just log in please and visit our website where you'll be prompted to enter your bank account number, passwords, mother's maiden name and pin numbers we will repair your systems for you."

[b][anchor=801]#801[/anchor]: Animation Provocation [Montagna; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
When media boss Ian Tivruski green-lighted a new Brancalandian animated series for the [i]@@DEMONYM@@ Kids Network[/i], he thought he was commissioning a delightful children's show about metal-working amazons who knit cozy jumpers for their grandkids. As it turns out, the surprisingly explicit animation [i]Sword Heroins: Love Needle[/i] has caused a lot of confusion amongst young viewers, and upset many parents.

The Debate
1. "Innocent children's minds need to be protected from such corruption," declares noted moral guardian Maria Polytunnel. "To achieve this, we should set up a Children's Regulatory Animation Panel, with me as its fully-paid leader, of course. We can then deem what is and what is not suitable for broadcast."

2. "Should we blame these images on TV? No! Blame Brancaland!" declares angry mother Sheila Brelufski. "We should send tanks, and planes, and soldiers to the Branclandian borders, threatening war unless they stop making this filth!"

3. "I don't get why people are complaining, to be honest," dissembles Tivruski defensively. "Clearly, we added 'Sword Heroins' to our line-up to educate children about the dangers of peer pressure, drug abuse, and challenging everyone you vaguely dislike to a duel. Let us broadcast what we like when we like, even if it does challenge the tastes of some of our more easily offended viewers. Stand up for free speech, and endorse our decision, @@LEADER@@."

4. "I think we're ignoring a broader issue here," bemoans frustrated animator Parker Stonetrey, "which is that animated art forms are never taken seriously enough to be considered anything more than kiddie fare. I say that we develop @@NAME@@'s artistic vision and creativity by subsidising adult animation. When people think @@NAME@@, they should think Hentai!"

[b][anchor=802]#802[/anchor]: No Lock, No Gun Stock, And No Smoking Barrels [Jutsa; ed: Ransium] [/b]

The Issue
Last night, a colonel checking the inventory at Fort @@ANIMAL@@, @@NAME@@'s largest military armory, found only a broken musket and a giant hole in the wall that @@HE@@ was pretty sure wasn't there earlier. There is a strong suspicion that this heist is linked to certain groups that have been raising a stink over @@NAME@@'s gun ban. 

The Debate
1. Commandant @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, the head of the breached facility, shows you a large schematic of a dense mass of mostly incomprehensible sketches, including a drawing of what appears to be a giant killer robot. "What we really need is to have more funding for security. We simply can not allow our weapons to be stolen, let alone potentially sold to the rebellious public. We need better security. In fact, our security facilities need their own security facilities. Sure, it'll be expensive, but it'll be worth it."

2. Your Minister of Law and Order draws a large, red X across the schematic. "This kind of thing doesn't exactly happen in a vacuum. We should focus on discouraging others by capturing the crooks who broke into our base in the first place. In fact, if we really want to get to the root of the problem, we should boost our national law enforcement to investigate and arrest anyone who is promoting the idea of guns being returned to our citizens."

3. "This wouldn't be a problem if guns were given back to the public," comments the somewhat sheepish looking colonel, while wadding the schematic into a ball and tossing it aside. "If our populace were armed, then they'd have less incentive to steal our weapons, except for the really cool ones I suppose. Plus, they'd have an easier time defending themselves in an attack."

4. "You've got it all backward!" interjects @@RANDOMNAME@@, a @@MAN@@ in fencing gear, who appears to have wandered in on the conversation. "These things were banned from the public for a reason - they are dangerous! We need to extend the present ban to the military - if they have a real problem, they can just use swords. Observe!" @@HE@@ skewers the crumpled schematic with @@HIS@@ rapier.

[b][anchor=803]#803[/anchor]: Park That Thought [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive] [/b]

The Issue
It is widely recognised that @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ are significantly smarter than the world average. There have been calls for the government to make use of this national resource.

The Debate
1. "Science! Progress! A Better Tomorrow!" sprays frazzle-haired twenty-something geek @@RANDOMNAME@@, mouth half full of cold pizza. "We're living in a changing economy, and the future lies in fuzzy logic and quantum computing. I'm not talking about a discrete quantity of computing... aha... ha... ah... Hmm, tough crowd. Anyway, the government should fund a Science Park to push forward the boundaries of technological thinking, and to shake up the status quo. It's an investment in the industries of the future!"

2. "Clever is as clever does," declares frazzle-haired thirty-something PhD student @@RANDOMNAME@@ smugly. "Governments and world leaders, you always want to monetise things, when actually intelligence and learning are their own reward. Instead, you should fund a Symposium Park, where ideas can be exchanged, poems can be written and minds can grow. No, there's no money in it. It's not all about money, you know."

3. "Clever? There is no clever..." intones frazzle-haired forty-something philosopher @@RANDOMNAME@@. "We are thinking too much about thinking and not enough about mindfulness. Give us some land to build a Meditation Park. Discourage this mad world-questioning and worship of intellect. Embrace introspection and spirituality, and grow our souls."

*4. "So we're an oh-so-clever nation, and now you want to build a national park celebrating that?" moans frazzle-haired fifty-something cattle breeder @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Give me a break! Help me out with setting up a Ranch Park where we can raise good quality cattle. IQ doesn't fill bellies. Beef fills bellies." [[color=blue]Must not have Vegetarianism.[/color]]

*5. "So we're an oh-so-clever nation, and now you want to build a national park celebrating that?" moans frazzle-haired fifty-something farmer @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Give me a break!

[b][anchor=804]#804[/anchor]: Motivational Posters [Omakhandia; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
A @@MAN@@ was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter yesterday. Over an extended period, @@HE@@ encouraged @@HIS@@ online acquaintance - who suffered from depression - to end his own life, which @@HE@@ subsequently did.

The Debate
1. "If this @@MAN@@ can be put on trial for @@HIS@@ words alone, what's next?" queries one of your younger advisors, texting you from a seminar on meme ethics. "We shouldn't be in the business of policing what people can and can't say. Yes, @@HE@@'s a terrible, terrible person; I mean, who does that, seriously? But this is much bigger than @@HIM@@. I urge you to pardon this @@MAN@@ immediately, and promote true freedom of speech and expression."

2. "We can't have people pushing others to suicide and getting away with it," calmly states your former Minister of Homeland Insecurities, who has taken up a career as an anti-cyberbullying activist. "Is it not our responsibility - as a society - to protect impressionable and vulnerable people? Now, if you ask me, this @@MAN@@ is not some sadistic monster, but @@HE@@, and others like @@HIM@@, need to learn that actions have consequences. Let @@HIM@@ face @@HIS@@ punishment, and divert some funding to provide for a national awareness program teaching people that their words actually carry weight."

3. "Obviously, both of these people were severely disturbed, and we all know what got them there," asserts your chronically under-stimulated Minister for Medieval Fairs, clad in motley, as is @@HIS@@ custom. "If anything, this is a wake-up call. @@NAME@@ needs to get rid of the internet altogether. Newfangled communications methods, with their instantaneity, clearly desensitize people and can make a troll out of the best of us. Not the 6 hit dice regenerating kind, mind you, the other sort. With the internet gone, people will have the time to truly reflect on their words, and nothing like this will ever happen again. Truly, it's a small price to pay for the well-being of our nation."

[b][anchor=805]#805[/anchor]: Solving A Dissolving Dilemma [TBA; ed:  Pogaria] [/b]

The Issue
Following several months of political squabbling, there is concern that the incumbent legislature in @@NAME@@ is no longer able to function efficiently. As a result, some have been questioning if voters should be allowed to dissolve the parliament and call for a new election.

The Debate
1. "This government is ridiculously ineffective!" exclaims Leader of the Opposition @@RANDOMNAME@@, who appears to have snuck into your office while you were out for lunch. "It's a well-documented fact that not even members of the majority party are satisfied with the current parliamentary leadership. Citizens should be able to initiate a referendum to dissolve the legislature! Let the people decide what the future of @@NAME@@ will be."

2. "This is obviously an absurd notion," says @@RANDOMNAME@@, the current Minister of the Interior. "@@NAME@@ has had a regular election schedule for ages, without any major catastrophes since that incident with Mr. Scruffy. There's no need to muck it up by constantly dissolving parliament. The voters elected us for a full term of office; to serve anything less than that is anti-democratic."

3. "If you ask me, the power to dissolve the legislature should only be wielded by our glorious leader," asserts infamous sycophant @@RANDOMNAME@@, the author of [i]1001 Paeans to @@LEADER@@[/i]. "In the capable hands of such an august personage, this awesome power can be used as a safeguard against those elected crooks in our parliament. I'm confidant our supreme protector wouldn't dare abuse it." @@HE@@ continues to stare at you in adulation as security escorts @@HIM@@ out of your office.

[b][anchor=806]#806[/anchor]: Unlicensed To Kill [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM@@ Medical Association has declared that participating in a lethal injection is a violation of medical ethics and grounds for revocation of license to practice. Following this development, a recent execution had to be postponed when all medical personal with the appropriate credentials to administer the execution refused to participate.

The Debate
1. "Acck! Vat a bunch of babies!" exclaims Dr. @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, your Minister of Mad Science, wearing @@HIS@@ trademark blood-splattered lab coat. "Zey can't even put murdering maniacs to death? Sure, my doctorate might be in zeoretical physics, but I've been performing quite a few dissections of late; I'm sure I could figure out how to administer a simple IV drip."

2. "I have an easier solution," utters @@RANDOMNAME@@, @@CAPITAL@@'s no-nonsense Chief of Police. "Make it the law that doctors have to participate in whatever medical procedures the government asks for. If those hippies want to continue to make their silly protests, you could make make sure they are 'Punished' with a capital 'P', if you catch my drift. Poetic justice, eh?"

3. "When are you going to accept that there is no good way to kill people?" yells Dr. @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, head of the @@DEMONYM@@ Medical Association. "That doctors refuse to participate in the act should tell you something of the act's value. Stop fooling yourself into thinking you're 'executing people humanely', and join the rest of the civilized world in outlawing the barbaric practice of capital punishment once and for all."

4. "Why don't we give ownership of the punishment back to the wronged parties?" asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, a stressed-looking accountant working the Justice Department's quarterly budget. "As in, get victims or the families of victims to administer the punishment. Just give them some syringes and needles, tell them which common domestic products are poisonous, and let them work it out for themselves. I mean, I expect they'll kill the convict [i]eventually[/i], and it'll be a really cheap fix."

[b][anchor=807]#807[/anchor]: Have War Crimes, Will Travel [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed:  Caracasus] [/b]

The Issue
A small disputed strip of land in your sphere of influence has been in a state of civil war for decades. @@NAME@@ has been approached by the international community to hold the first round of peace talks. Unfortunately Colonel Idi Amore, the self-styled revolutionary in charge of the Popular Freedom Fighters with multiple warrants for war crimes against him, will have to be issued a safe conduct pass to attend the talks without fear of arrest.

The Debate
1. "The Popular Freedom Fighters are a disgusting group!" yells @@RANDOMNAME@@, a grief-stricken refugee."They killed my father, razed our village, and ruined my stamp collection! I say you invite their jerk of a leader into @@NAME@@, then you have your police arrest the monster! It's the only way justice can be served."

2. "You can't seriously be considering this!" exclaims overworked diplomat @@RANDOMNAME@@. "We've been working for years to bring peace to this region. He may have blood on his hands, but so do the other sixteen sides in this war. A sudden power vacuum will just prolong the hostilities! We have a real chance of securing a lasting peace here, surely that's worth overlooking a couple of mass murders?"

3. "This really is a bind," muses your trusted advisor @@RANDOMNAME@@. "If we arrest him on our soil, we will forever be known as people who breach our safe conduct passes. If we let him go, we will let a wanted war criminal slip through our fingers. The solution is plain: refuse to hold the talks. I'm sure they can figure it out without us looking over their shoulder."

4. "We want this warlord gone, but don't want to look bad because of it," whispers Agent Cobblepot from behind an oversized potted plant. "Give this individual safe conduct, let him do his thing and if some kind of terrible accident were to befall our dear friend... how could you possibly have known that ceiling beam was going to fall on his head?"

[b][anchor=808]#808[/anchor]: Big Trouble In Little Dàguó [Laeral; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The large, militaristic nation of Dàguó is currently in a dispute with the breakaway province of New Dàguó. As nations around the world begin to take sides, opposing ambassadors have arrived in your office to seek your support.

The Debate
1. "This 'New Dàguó' is nothing but a treasonous cartel of hoodlums and degenerates," scowls @@RANDOMNAME@@, the ambassador from the Empire of Dàguó. "We are one of your most important trading partners, especially for your @@MAJORINDUSTRY@@ industry. We demand affirmation as the one true and legitimate government of Dàguó. Don't believe the lies those criminals tell you - our Holy Emperor, long may he live, provides true prosperity and success to all of his citizens. Besides, we might just have to take military action against those who support the so-called New Dàguó - and you want to be on the correct side in this coming war, don't you?"

2. "We deserve recognition!" asserts @@RANDOMNAME@@, the self-proclaimed ambassador from New Dàguó. "We are a democratic nation that holds free elections in our territory. Dàguó's tyrannical regime was oppressing us, so we declared a revolution! Sure, they outnumber us ten to one, but if you send us weapons and support, we'll become fully independent in no time! We'll even pay you back after we figure out how to import enough food without Dàguó's price controls."

3. Your Minister of Foreign Affairs, @@RANDOMNAME@@, comes up to you and whispers in your ear. "Look, @@LEADER@@, we can't afford to lose our trade with Dàguó - our @@MAJORINDUSTRY@@ industry would collapse! But we also shouldn't turn a blind eye to Dàguó's flagrant human rights abuses. How about we send a vaguely-worded statement saying that we support a peaceful solution to the conflict, and then just say that we supported the winning side all along? It's a no-risk solution."

4. Later, your seldom-seen Minister of Whispers appears behind you in what you thought was a deserted corridor. "We have an exceptional opportunity here, Your Excellency. It would be easy to discreetly sell weapons to both sides while remaining officially neutral. Our enemies in Dàguó will become increasingly unstable, while we profit from the situation. Some may call these actions unethical - but @@NAME@@ didn't start this conflict. We're just acting in the best interests of the realm, of course."

[b][anchor=809]#809[/anchor]: So Long, And Thanks For All The Fish [Szczuropolis; ed: Ransium] [/b]

The Issue 
Mounting scientific research shows the fishery stocks across territorial waters are plummeting, with the possibility of whole fisheries collapsing in the near future.

The Debate
*1. "There is only one reasonable thing to do," proclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Fish. "We must immediately introduce limited fishing quotas, add restrictions on catch size, and punish any violators harshly! There simply aren't enough fish to go around. I'm afraid the fishing industry will just have to take one for the school." [[color=blue]Must allow Alcohol[/color]]

*2. "There is only one reasonable thing to do," proclaims your Minister of Agriculture and Aquaculture, looking up from a paper splattered with red ink. "We simply can't allow ourselves to sink more funds into an industry that's about to go belly up anyway. Gut the fishing fleet, so that their capacity only matches sustainable fish harvesting levels. You can shift the funds to retrain the crews for other jobs to ensure no one's livelihood is threatened. The boats can carry tourists and vacationers instead." [[color=red]Must not allow Alcohol[/color]]

**3. "Hold on there, matey!" exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, head of the Trawler and Angler Trade Union of @@NAME@@. "Surely there are plenty of fish in the sea, at least in the remote, international waters of @@REGION@@? The government must subsidize a massive fleet of full sea trawlers. Do that and we'll have those fine-finned delicacies back on your table in no time!" [[color=blue]Must have Private Industry[/color]]

**4. "Hold on there, matey!" exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, head of the Trawler and Angler Trade Committee. "Surely there are plenty of fish in the sea, at least in the remote, international waters of @@REGION@@? Let us invest in a massive fleet of full sea trawlers and we'll have those fine-finned delicacies back on your table in no time!" [[color=red]Must not have Private Industry[/color]]

5. "There is inadequate data to know with such certainty fisheries are in danger of collapse," suggests @@RANDOMNAME@@, contrarian professor in the Department of Marine Studies and Fin Cuisine at University of @@CAPITAL@@ while reaching for a slice of lemon. "Maybe it's been a rough few years for our gilled friends for reasons other than the millions of fish we catch a year. The only thing to do is collect more data. Keep things as they are and continue to monitor fish intake. If fish catches continue to decrease over the next two to three hundred years, then we can be sure we have a problem."

[b][anchor=810]#810[/anchor]: Armed and Unready [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed: Candlewhisper Archive] [/b]

The Issue
A small countryside skirmish against a score of bandit militiamen ended in a complete catastrophe, despite the deployment of two dozen @@DEMONYM@@ battle tanks and one hundred and fifty infantrymen. The @@DEMONYM@@ conscripts proved to be no match for their well-trained and motivated enemies. Unsurprisingly, the perceived quality of the nation's soldiers has come under heavy fire.

The Debate
1. "Hang on, which end is it that we point at the bad guys?" asks clueless Private @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, haplessly staring down the barrel of an assault rifle in genuine confusion. "I give up! Look here, @@LEADER@@, I'm just not cut out to be a soldier, neither is anyone else in my unit. You have millions of men who couldn't hit the side of a barn with a battle tank main gun, even if the tank was parked in the barn! Couldn't you let us prove our pride in our glorious nation by doing some good instead, like tending to the elderly, cleaning up the streets or peeling potatoes?"   

2.  "Our military isn't what it was in the good old days," comments retired Drill Sergeant @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@. "You should revisit basic drill and training. Concentrate on the fundamentals, like disciplined formation marching to the beat of a drum, standing up straight, keeping your uniform shiny, and having abuse shouted in your left ear."

[3]. "As always, technology has the answer!" announces computer programmer @@RANDOMNAME@@, pausing halfway through level 242 of Call of Honor to talk to you. "With the latest targeting computers in our military equipment, even a child couldn't miss! An interlaced augmented reality overlay and combat AI could tell soldiers in real time squad and enemy locations, ranges, wind speed, optimal weapon selection, tactical movements, inspirational morale boosting messages.... It's modern warfare!" [[color=blue]Must have computers[/color]]

4. "I think your approach is already correct," wheedles @@RANDOMNAME@@, your sycophantic aide-de-camp. "In fact, the only issue we have is that we don't conscript enough soldiers! With greater numbers, victory would be assured. For starters, I'm sure the elderly and the disabled would be proud to serve our great nation."  

5. "Or you could go back to having a volunteer army," mutters @@RANDOMNAMEMALE@@, hand-cuffed deserter and sole survivor of the recent massacre. "Look, I didn't want to be a soldier anyway. I wanted to be... [i]a lumberjack![/i] Leaping from tree to tree as they float down the mighty rivers of... of... Anyway, ditch the draft."

[b][anchor=811]#811[/anchor]: Get Baked [White Girls Metropolis; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
While strolling through the annual bake sale at your niece's school, you couldn't help but overhear a heated argument between two of the mothers at a nearby snickerdoodle-and-cupcake display.

The Debate
1. "@@RANDOMFIRSTNAMEFEMALE@@, I don't care how much kale you put into those cupcakes; we just shouldn't be feeding this much sugar to children," lectures one gaunt-looking mother, waving a carrot in exasperation. She catches a glimpse of you out of the corner of her eye and turns to you. "@@LEADER@@! You must regulate all junk food going to our children at school! If we need a fundraiser, we can sell fruits and vegetables instead of this high-calorie, low energy bull-"

2. "Oh my, @@RANDOMFIRSTNAMEFEMALE@@, you must watch your mouth! There are children in here!" complains her dumpling-shaped counterpart, hip-bumping her way to a centre-stage position in the conversation and sending the previous speaker flying into a tower of rice cereal treats. "You can't get rid of this sugary goodness! These kids love it. If anything, we need MORE sugar, and some help for businesses that provide the sweet treats that bring so much happiness. Who cares if people are gaining weight? That's just evolution."

[3]. "Evolution? That's what this is about?" interjects @@RANDOMFIRSTNAMEFEMALE@@, local Violetist and busybody, showing up from behind a display of savoury doughnuts in the shape of a Violetist religious symbol. "The Holy Purple Passages state that 'Sweetness Is Not Virtue, and You Shall Not Consume the Fruit of the Cane.' Maybe that's not exactly correct, but you get my point! Ban desserts entirely!" [[color=blue]Violetism is legal[/color]]

4. "AAAAAAAAAAARGH!" screams your niece, causing everyone to suddenly turn to her. "Thank you! Who cares what kids eat? It should be our choice alone if we want to eat cookies and candy all the time, not yours! Give children the choice to put whatever food we want in our bodies, it's the only way!"

[b][anchor=812]#812[/anchor]: The Old Boys' Club [Nation of Quebec; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
A recent survey of @@NAME@@'s politicians has revealed that a majority of them identify as "old @@DEMONYM@@ men of @@FAITH@@". The same study revealed a significant lack of female politicians, especially in your Cabinet. Angry social activists have demanded that you take immediate executive action or face the consequences next election.

The Debate
1. "Whatever happened to making sure the best person gets the job?" queries your old school friend and high-ranking Party MP, @@RANDOMNAMEMALE@@, who always surrounds himself with buxom blondes during [i]Question Period[/i]. "It ain't broke, so don't fix it! If these womenfolk want to get elected, then more qualified candidates should step forward. Hell, if they weren't always whining about gender equality and the so-called glass ceiling, people might take them more seriously."

2. "I've always said that Parliament needs a woman's touch," notes @@RANDOMNAMEFEMALE@@, a small-town mayor who wrote of her national ambitions in a book entitled [i]You Shouldn't Need A Member To Be A Member[/i]. "As I've mentioned countless times before, @@NAME@@ must rid itself of its old boys' club. Introduce quotas that mandate 50% of all political and Cabinet positions be reserved for women. This will ensure that all voices are heard, not just the privileged few."

3. "Perhaps the reason why more women aren't entering politics is because they have a naturally lower tolerance for corruption," twitters pop psychologist @@RANDOMNAMEMALE@@, whose doctorate is in floristry. "If the government began cracking down on the rampant ministerial corruption, you'd start seeing more diversity emerge organically. There'd also be gradual attrition of the behind-the-timers, and when they want to leave...well, they know where the door is. That has to be better than forcing it."

4. "Silence!" bellows black-latex clad dominatrix @@RANDOMNAMEFEMALE@@, as she flicks at the previous speaker's calf with her whip. "These pathetic little steps are a start, but don't go nearly far enough! It's high time these mansplaining politicians in their ivory towers faced the same kind of discrimination that we face on a daily basis. If lessons are to be learned we must be severe: restrict the number of male politicians harshly. Ensure these puny males afford proper respect to their female superiors. And no more talking over women, shouting about things about which they know nothing. Such errors will be corrected most assiduously."

5. "Hold on! What about an option that doesn't discriminate?" asks your cleaner @@RANDOMNAME@@, sitting on your desk with surprising ease for a @@MAN@@ of @@HIS@@ advanced age. "Need I remind you all that sortition doesn't discriminate? Male and female, young and old, @@DEMONYM@@ or immigrant, it doesn't care. Everyone will get their, albeit short, time to serve. Granted, all MP selections will be completely random, but at least then nobody can complain that there's deliberate discrimination!"

The Issue
The Supreme Leader of Blackacre, Valeria Drake, threatened to "make it rain fire and fury all over @@NAME@@" via her Twitcher account. A horde of security experts have surrounded you to discuss the precautions that must be taken.

The Debate
1. "We cannot underestimate the danger!" asserts your Minister of Defense, carefully putting @@HIS@@ Castles & Cockatrices figurines on your desk with a rather creepy smile. "A threat is a threat, be it declared via a twitch or at a fancy press conference with all the bells and whistles. We must respond accordingly, by preemptively positioning battleships within bombardment range of their major cities. If they don't back down, we'll wipe them off the map! That'll teach them what a rain of fire looks like." @@HE@@ chuckles as @@HE@@ knocks over a miniature effigy of Supreme Leader Drake with a wyvern.

2. "Aren't we taking this woman's Twitcher rants a bit too seriously?" questions your Ambassador to Blackacre, without showing any effort to disguise @@HIS@@ boredom. "I mean, this gal basically twitches all the time about xenophobic conspiracy theories or rants about dissidents. You should not reinforce this nonsense by giving her the attention she craves. Ignore her, and hopefully she'll learn to govern her country like an adult."

3. "If you let her get away with this insult, our people will start to question your competence as a leader!" clamours @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Public Relations Adviser, as @@HE@@ scrolls down on @@HIS@@ phone to read Drake's vitriolic twitches. "What we should do is to set up an official Twitcher account for you. This way you can counter Drake's attacks with her own weapon. An eye for an eye. You can also use this account to polish up your public image, of course. Your ministers could get in on this too."

A recent story in the @@CAPITAL@@ Herald showed that massive @@DEMONYM@@ demand for Maxtopian jumbo shrimp is driving environmentally damaging practices in Maxtopia, including the rapid clearing of mangrove forests for huge jumbo shrimp farms. In response, @@NAME@@'s biggest green lobbying group has launched a campaign demanding that the @@DEMONYM@@ government block unsustainable imports exemplified by the oversized Maxtopian seafood.

The Debate
1. "This is an outrage!" exclaims environmentalist @@RANDOMNAME@@, while hastily wiping something that looks suspiciously like cocktail sauce from @@HIS@@ mouth. "We'd never tolerate this sort of environmental degradation here; why would we enable it in other countries through trade? We must ban these delectable - er, detestable shrimp imports from Maxtopia, and make sure we are properly assessing the environmental impact of all goods imported into @@NAME@@."

2. "@@DEMONYNPLURAL@@ wouldn't have to import these things if more was produced at home," states @@NAME@@'s only organic jumbo shrimp farmer, @@RANDOMNAME@@, holding what appears to be a scrawny-looking crayfish. "Cut a few environmental regulations here, throw a few @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ at businesses such as mine, and I could grow my little jumbo shrimp farm enormously while lowering the prices for consumers. It'll still be greener than those barbarians in Maxtopia and you'll be putting @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ back to work!"

3. "Why should we care what's happening all the way in Maxtopia?" asks one of your aides, @@RANDOMNAME@@, while sunning @@HIM@@self on your office's balcony and eating a shrimp platter. "We can't solve all the world's problems, so let's focus on what matters: keeping @@NAME@@ beautiful. If anything, we should be outsourcing more of @@NAME@@'s most polluting industries." @@HE@@ then turns up @@HIS@@ boombox and gestures at the shrimp. "Want one?"

The Issue
A coalition of economically powerful nations have made headlines by installing an embargo against @@NAME@@, citing  the nation's weapons of mass destruction program as "alarmingly large and detrimental to world peace." It is predicted that serious damage to the economy may be imminent, with particular emphasis laid on the loss of trade in agricultural produce between @@NAME@@ and these countries.

The Debate
*1. "This is an outrage!" yells @@RANDOMNAME@@, CEO of Megafruit Imports, kicking over a crate of unexported and slightly rotten-looking @@DEMONYM@@ kumquats in rage. "So what if @@NAME@@ might have stepped on a few toes here and there? All we're guilty of is being a strong and proud nation. Send the navy in to blockade their ports, and they'll soon come crawling back." [[color=blue]Must have Private Industry[/color]]

*2. "Typical," sneers Commissariat Chief @@RANDOMNAME@@, kicking over a crate of unexported and slightly rotten-looking @@DEMONYM@@ kumquats in rage. "These profiteering swine will do anything to undermine our glorious nation, but they are nothing more than paper tigers. I say we place agents and supply arms to instigate socialist revolution in these nations. Once the people there seize power from their oppressive masters, we'll soon see those imports come flooding back." [[color=red]Must not have Private Industry[/color]]

3. "Are we really going to risk starting war over this?" quails @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, your Minister of Dairies, shaking in fear behind @@HIS@@ pineapple milkshake. "Even if we win, the problem isn't just that these nations are not trading with us, it's that our agricultural economy isn't self-sufficient. With some significant investments from the government and a ban on all imports, I'm sure we can achieve food security and a state of absolute economic independence from foreign trade."

4. "Plenty more fish in the sea," shrugs your Minister for Trade, looking remarkably calm about the entire situation. "There's plenty of smuggl... er, [i]enterprising traders[/i] in these nations perfectly willing to facilitate trade between ourselves and the nations in this so-called 'Coalition'. Sure, it's a bit on the dodgy side legally speaking, but I'm sure we'll muddle through somehow!"

5. "Maybe we should listen to this coalition's entirely reasonable demands, and scale back our weapons programs," muses your Foreign Minister, munching on a Maxtopian mango. "It's not like we really need that many smallpox-infused nuclear warheads, is it? Then, legume trade can proceed."

[b][anchor=816]#816[/anchor]: A Hot Topic [The Atlae Isles; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
After @@NAME@@'s Forestry Department started its controversial program of controlled fire - intentionally setting parts of forests aflame to remove fuel for larger wildfires - a fire started by the Forestry Department got a bit hotter than expected and sparked an evacuation of Northwest @@CAPITAL@@.

The Debate
1. "I just don't see why this is being debated with such intensity," yawns @@RANDOMNAME@@, an official in the Forestry Department, while casually flipping open a lighter. "Controlled burns are a proven way to reduce the severity and expense of wildfires. Fire is an element of many forests in @@NAME@@; we're just making sure it doesn't get out of hand. I admit we didn't do so hot with that last fire, but we'll get better, I promise."

2. "You can't keep doing this!" coughs @@RANDOMNAME@@, asthmatic alderman representing Northwest @@CAPITAL@@, while eyeing an unlit candle on your desk nervously. "The smoke from these 'controlled fires' is putting out tons of air pollution and inflaming my lungs. Besides, those bumbling amateurs in red almost 'control burnt' half my district down! Stop this program and focus on fighting fires."

*3. "Do I have a deal for you?" exclaims Big Ed Sharp, owner of Big Ed Sharp's Chainsaw Emporium. "You have a bunch of brush and small trees that are fuel for a wildfire. I have chainsaws galore available at low, low prices. Just hire a bunch more forest rangers to go out there with chainsaws. It'll be expensive and not as 'natural', whatever that means, but the mature trees in the forests will thrive and wildfires will be much less severe, without that nasty smoke!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. “You know what’s better than that? A compromise!” exclaims your Minister of Making Work @@RANDOMNAME@@. “There are so many @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ who are struggling to find the best way to contribute to the glory of @@NAME@@. All you need to do is send them out to the woods and have them remove those small trees and brush by hand. It’ll be expensive and not as natural, sure, but there will be no more smoke, the mature trees in the forests will thrive, and there will be a great new patriotic project for the workers to participate in.” [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

The Issue
Following her admittance one week ago, @@RANDOMFIRSTNAMEFEMALE@@ McCormack was arrested at @@ANIMAL@@ General Hospital this morning, charged with attempting to procure her own abortion. Crowds have been clamouring for her immediate release and others – including the would-be father, calling from the cell her testimony put him in – are demanding she be punished with maximum vigour.

The Debate
1. "How could she do this?" sighs Lila Tann, who runs both the Pregnancy Advisory Service and the Bouncing Bambinos Adoption Agency. "Of course, Miss McCormack had a trauma, but why compound that with another? Baby-murder kills the child's body, but it shatters the woman's mind. She can never get over it. Besides, there's always adoption: the safe and pain-free way to give innocent children a chance. You must maintain the abortion ban, in all cases, and support our extensive pro-adoption campaign. It's just forty weeks of their lives. What could possibly go wrong?"

2. "I can certainly see why Miss McCormack would feel like drastic measures were her only option," notes self-professed moderate pro-life advocate, Jedson Dumphy. "Fortunately, I have a solution that can't fail to please all y'all folks. We'll permit it, only for very specific exceptions: for victims of legitimate, proven non-consensual sex or when the host-mother will certainly die without treatment, up to a nine-week gestation period, and with permission of the baby's father."

3. "These people are deluded," a shadowy figure stands in the corner, their gravelly voice indistinguishable as male or female. "Do you want blood on your hands and deaths on your conscience? There could be treatable second-trimester complications and botched back-alley abortions that would have been completed safely in a proper hospital. Women seeking abortion are desperate. They'll try anything, regardless of any restrictions you can pull out of your a... administration. Bring universally available, medical abortion back to @@NAME@@."

4. "We must pursue righteousness with yet more rigour," intones softly-spoken religious leader, @@RANDOMNAMEMALE@@, his black cloak swishing around him. "I constantly hear of 'miscarriages'. Do you know their real name: spontaneous abortion! An abortion, yet there is no punishment. To call them 'miscarriages' perverts the Law that the female can only be saved through childbearing. Unless the woman categorically proves her 'miscarriage' was not potentially the result of cruelty or negligence, our duty is plain: a life for a life! The Text is most clear on this." He wafts his book under your nose, snapping it closed before your eyes can focus.

5. "We must pursue righteousness with yet more rigour," intones softly-spoken right-wing moral crusader, @@RANDOMNAMEMALE@@, dressed in all black. "I constantly hear of 'miscarriages'. Do you know their real name: spontaneous abortion! An abortion, yet there is no punishment. To call them 'miscarriages' perverts nature! Unless the woman categorically proves her 'miscarriage' was not potentially the result of cruelty or negligence, our duty is plain: a life for a life!." He quickly runs off before you can question him.

[b][anchor=818]#818[/anchor]: We Are Not Amused [Orisoun; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
 Entertainment tycoon and billionaire Walter Eisner has proposed Eisnerland, a massive theme park that he wants to build in an economically impoverished area of northwestern @@NAME@@. Due to the significant expense of this project, Mr. Eisner is asking for state funds to help finance it.

The Debate
1. "Eisner Enterprises has provided a great source of joy and family entertainment ever since our first animated motion picture, [i]Robbie the Rambunctious @@ANIMAL@@[/i], delighted our audiences," says Mr. Eisner as he skips around your desk in a business suit and 'Robbie Ears.' "My wonderland of whimsy will increase economic growth in @@NAME@@, and has a chance to become the number one tourist destination in all of @@REGION@@! Of course, we will have to move a few thousand residents out of the way, but we'll be providing much-needed employment for the area. Now would you like to see my plans for the Experimental Prototype Community Recreation Area Project?"

2. "This is an insane proposition," declares @@RANDOMNAME@@, bursting in with a homemade picket sign that depicts Robbie sitting on a throne of cash. "These corporate monsters are trying to evict us from our homes in order to build this megalopolis of rickety rides and greasy, overpriced corn dogs. For the well-being of our families and communities, and the reputation of our nation, please refuse to provide funds for Eisnerland and ban all new corporate projects in residential areas."

3. "No one thinks about the alternative possibilities for these dilemmas," remarks @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Secretary of Compromises and Other Weird Solutions, who appears to be wearing a different-colored sock on each foot. "You see, the obvious answer is to move the entire project out to the desert. There are no residential areas or regulations to worry about! Sure, many people would be exhausted moving around in the scorching heat, and there aren't any nearby restaurants, hospitals, or hotels, but perhaps the government could help pay for some of those as well."

4. "You can't put a big amusement park there!" shouts artist Harry Jarvey, who is infamous for burning all of his sculptures within a week of their completion. "That desert is the site of our annual arts and radical inclusivity festival. The whole thing is based on freedom of expression and participation, not the sale of pre-packaged commercialism. To turn our cherished playa into a morass of corporate commodification would be an outrage! I insist that you prevent this Eisner fellow from leaving any trace of his vanity project in our desert - or anywhere else - and maybe have the government subsidize our event, for good measure. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to write a few more rules for next year's festival."

[b][anchor=819]#819[/anchor]: Damned Cold [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Through a complex and unorthodox set of theological deductions, respected community faith leader @@RANDOMNAMEMALE@@ decided that the local cryonics facility was a work of intrinsic evil. Late one night, he broke in and took a sledge hammer to ten cryogenically frozen brains. He didn't try to evade or resist arrest, and is now honestly surprised people think he has done anything wrong. The question is, what exactly is his crime?

The Debate
1. "Those who had their brains frozen were working on the assumption that they might one day in the future be resurrected, something which experts say is a virtual statistical certainty, given enough time," explains cryonics facility director @@RANDOMNAME@@, whose ruthless business dealings have earned @@HIM@@ the nickname 'Captain Cold'. "Now, they've been denied that. That makes this crime ten counts of murder. Hopefully, nice strict sentencing here will teach people not to mess with our corporate holdings in the future." 

2. "Whoa, whoa! Playing piñata with some dead frozen brain popsicles is not the same as spilling the sloppy red stuff of a living person!" asserts tactless journalist Elsa @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@. "I'm not saying we should just let it go, but this wasn't murder. It was a crime of forced entry, damage to corporate property and desecration of human remains. Perhaps we should exercise some leniency seeing how this was, in fact, a political protest."

3. "Actually... there may have been a solid basis for what this protester was saying," ponders theologian Jadis Queen, poring over some apocryphal texts of her faith. "To be on the safe side, we should shut down all cryonics facilities. After all, our immortal souls may be at risk here."

4. "Not sure if this is a criminal matter or just some religious lunatic with a hammer," comments pizza delivery boy @@RANDOMFIRSTNAMEMALE@@ Fry, handing you your pizza. "The guy was clearly nuts either way. Sounds to me like a mental health problem. He needs a psychiatrist, not a prison cell."
