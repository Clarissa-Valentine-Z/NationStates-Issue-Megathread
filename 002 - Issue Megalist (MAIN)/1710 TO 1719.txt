[b][anchor=1710]#1710[/anchor]: Fancy Some Sparkling Water? [Bendicion; ed: Southland][/b]

The Issue 
A leaked memo has revealed that Sakura, a technologically-advanced neighboring archipelagic country that relies heavily on nuclear power, is planning on releasing several million tons of treated radioactive water previously used to cool their plants out into the open sea. Although Sakura subsequently and rather hastily claimed the treated water is completely harmless, many neighboring countries are not convinced and have asked you to join a conference to decide what should be done.

The Debate
*1. "Radioactive water into the sea! Are they joking?" blurts the Dàguó representative while scarfing down his seafood bird nest lunch. "They make it seem safe, but everyone knows that even a tiny fraction of radioactive elements can cause a health crisis! @@NAME@@ and Dàguó must join forces to blockade and sanction Sakura, or those barbarians won't stop dumping their cancerous water until the whole world is swimming in it! After all" — he glowers at you after taking a bite — "you wouldn't want something bad to happen to your largest trading partner, would you? Losing some pineapples and Sakuranime imports is surely worth it." [[color=red]Must not have enforced vegetarianism[/color]]

Losing some pineapples and Sakuranime imports is surely worth it." [[color=blue]Must have enforced vegetarianism[/color]]

3. "The Dàguó ambassador is overreacting, as typical of them. There is nothing wrong with the water once treated!" the Sakuran representative speaks as her assistant places a conspicuously glowing teacup on her desk. "Our world-class scientists have worked tirelessly to make sure the treated water is safe. We even got the green light from several scientific institutions across the globe. It's so safe, our technicians at our Onishima Daishi plant have brewed matcha with it. Here, let me show you!" After downing the tea in one gulp, she cheers "See? Tangy but safe! Stand by us, and in exchange we will give you preferential trade status and provide our best nuclear tech to power your nation. We will show all there's nothing to fear from this completely s-safe n-nothin v-vad haf-haffewend—" she collapses as her assistant abruptly escorts her out.

4. "Ze problem here iz ve do not have ze technology to remove all of ze radioactive materials from ze wasser," proclaims Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your eccentric science advisor and president of the Association for Terminating Orthodox Methods. "It can be 100% safe if ve can separate ze element Niponitium instead of merely diluting it. Fortunately, I haff developed a prototype zat vill eliminate ze radiation, but I need ze resources to perfect it. Send to mein lab all ze Niponitium from across @@NAME@@, und I vill develop ze ultimate treatment to zell to Sakura. Soon @@REGION@@ zall tremble before mein greatest zooperweap — I mean treatment!"

5. "Why not build a sea wall on our maritime borders?" your Minister for Creative Solutions casually chimes in while shooting crumpled pieces of paper at a trashcan. "Just hear me out. If we build a sea wall we can keep the dirty water out and keep our precious clean water in. The way I see it, it can also keep sea animals and plants safe from pollution of other countries too, right? Well, I guess not but we'll still be able to keep those pesky foreign ships and fishermen out. Anyway, I think it's probably time for lunch now. Who's up for some sushi?"

The Issue
While biking to the store to pick up some butter on your day off, you were stopped by a disorderly throng of protesters blocking a major bike thoroughfare. In attempting to deduce the reason for the protest, you note the mob generally to be of middle-class families, with the exception of one wealthy luxury car collector. After much shouting, it becomes clear the collective individuals want compensation for their now useless cars.

The Debate
1. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who appears to be the leader of the protest group Citizens for Automobile Reparations, stops chanting to address you: "Ah, @@LEADER@@! Finally come to hear our grievances? This car ban is fine in principle, but you have to think about the little guy. Like @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ over there. @@HE_1@@ had just bought a new car to get to work, now a two hour walk by the way, and now @@HE_1@@ works two low paying gigs closer to home to keep up with a loan for a useless piece of metal, while struggling to put food on the table. To make things right, the government must buy back the cars of all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ at full sticker value. We can start with my limited edition @@ANIMAL@@ Roadster WX9000."</OPTION>

2. "If you wants to think of the little guy, think of this little guy." says 'Big @@RANDOM_NAME@@' Giordano owner of 'Giordano's Wrecking and Recycling', who happens to have been biking behind you in @@HIS@@ heavy-duty tow tricycle. "I've got a perfectly good business, buying cars on the cheap and sellin' 'em for scrap. Sure, we can't pay anywhere near the car's pre-ban value, but I'm a small business owner makin' a livin' and I don't cost the gub'ment nothin'. Problem is, now I don't have time to make sure good salvage don't end up cloggin' the garbage dump. If the government was givin' me a tax break for recyclin' and the like, I could bring on more folks. I'll even hire @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ right here to prove my point!"

3. "These money obsessed consumerist drones are forgetting the true purpose of the car ban — to heal our environment!" rants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, environmental consultant and author of [i]Greener Than Thou[/i]. "What would these people do with car compensation money? They'd buy more superfluous, energy draining luxuries made from Earth's precious resources, just to prove to their neighbors they've 'made it'. A healthy @@NAME@@ is all the compensation they need! The government must seize all remaining cars in @@NAME@@, melt them down, and make an enormous statue of the planet to place in @@CAPITAL@@. Then the people will have a constant reminder of the harm our past sins have brought on the environment, and can avoid making the same mistakes in the future."

4. "Huh? No, the real value of the car ban is it makes my life easier." asserts police chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@ who has been working to move the protesters off the bike path. "I think that enviro-nut was onto something with just taking the cars from people. But, I've got an idea way better than making them into a useless statue. We take the nicest cars and turn them into police cars, and the rest we can melt down and make into other government essentials. I'm sure folks won't mind the 'donation' to helping keep the peace."

[b][anchor=1712]#1712[/anchor]: Jerk Rice Jerkoff [Enzonar; ed: Kractero][/b]

The Issue
Celebrity chef Jori Orange served up a fresh dish of controversy after his new "Lilliputian jerk rice", a product he has endorsed and cooked on his show, has been found to taste nothing like the traditional dish. Angry members of the Lilliputian diaspora in @@NAME@@ are accusing the chef of culturally appropriating their cuisine.

The Debate
1. A crack and thud can be heard as a rolling pin bludgeons one of your guards. Before you can react, a woman grabs your shoulder and roars, "This horrifying mush is not jerk rice! It looks more like what we would feed the farm animals back home in Lilliputian farms! This guy is telling us how WE'RE supposed to cook our own food? Our food has been passed down from generations and now this man is advertising it as "healthy and clean rice"? Ban these hacks from making a mockery of traditional dishes, and give money to real Lilliputian cooks who are starving because of this man!" She pulls out Jori's cookbook and puts a match to it. "Here, let me show you how mama makes it..."

*2. "I think this outrage is a bit over-cooked," plays a sound clip of Jori Orange from the television in your office. "I absolutely adore the history and tradition behind jerk rice. Hunting parties going out at dawn to find the freshest chickens to pair them with logs of grease is awe-inspiring stuff. But alas, times change, people nowadays want dishes that aren't a cardiovascular risk and that fit their fad diets. Who better to modernize and clean up these dishes than a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ like me?

4. "Look man, I dunno if this jerk rice is authentic or not..." remarks a stoned person eating a pizza topped with various fruits under your desk. "But if it tastes good, why should it be banned? In fact, why not apply this to all food? What's the point of expiration dates, portion sizes, and calories anyway? I think you should just leave us alone, and let us eat whatever we want." The man pours milk into his soda, and offers you a sip.

[5]. A man sporting a fake beard and eyeliner, Walther Whitlam III, or someone who looks awfully like him, approaches you with a suggestion. "Enough with this Lilliputian riff-raff. The problem is that the public perceives @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ food as bland, so it's the government's job to promote and develop our own cuisine. If you start importing seasonings, and promoting cooking competitions, you'll build a proper food culture in @@NAME@@. You can start with a bit of my own special seasoning." He hands you a vial of an unidentified red substance before jumping out of the nearest window before your security detail can arrest him. [[color=blue]Must have Autarky[/color]]

[b][anchor=1713]#1713[/anchor]: CEOs Shilled the Radio Star [Millenhaal; ed: Klaus Devestatorie][/b]

The Issue
A year ago, a group of disgruntled executives, producers and artists left music industry heavyweight Cosmopolitan Music Group to found Havoc Sound. When all of their releases flopped spectacularly this summer, Havoc received a tip from an anonymous source that CMG had paid DJs, radio stations and streaming services to suppress Havoc's songs and promote their own music instead.

The Debate
*1. "Imagine if book publishers bribed librarians to take their rivals off the shelves!" rants the massively muscled Creative Director of Havoc Sound, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pushing a stack of incriminating documents towards you. "Our artists sweat blood to produce their music, and these fat cats just turn the volume down? That's absolute garbage! You can't just substitute real talent with another 'Back-alley Bros' club remix. We're a victim of big business trying to strengthen their cartel. Put these corrupt executives behind bars and order the police force to investigate record labels for this airway robbery! Let songs rise and fall off the charts on their own merit!" [TBD]

Take back every @@CURRENCY@@ these corrupt executives have ever pocketed and order the police force to investigate record labels for this airway robbery! Let songs rise and fall off the charts on their own merit!" [TBD]

3. "If you don't know the rules of the game, you shouldn't be playing it," snickers the CEO of Cosmopolitan Music Group, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Whether you like it or not, the music biz is still an industry. It's all about who can buy the best equipment, who can market and promote their music to the biggest audience, and who can make enough industry connections to ensure releases go smoothly. Our arrangements with our partners are just another extension of that. If pay-for-play is illegal, then put me in the stocks and walk away for the weekend! Well, actually, I'd prefer if you just made it tax deductible instead. Yeah, let's do that."

4. "Ugh, both of you are criminals as far as I'm concerned, all you make is sanitized, banal, Top 40 slop!" groans your hipster-ish nephew, pausing an album by the band 'Feral Nun Rodeo'. "Every time I turn on the radio, it's always the same sterile beats. Even the 'alternative' stations play tunes that sound like they were designed in a boardroom! You need to make it so all music on the radio is actually diverse, so people with developed music tastes like me don't have to dry-retch all the time. Set up an agency that looks out for listeners and forces stations to play independent artists, not just the sell-outs who signed with CMG or Havoc. It's about time we finally had some decent music around!"

5. "SILENCE!" roars a shadowy figure arising from a dark corner of your office, a flowing black cloak draping his entire figure. His words, though slow and barely above a whisper, resonate throughout the room. "I tire of this needless noise. It pollutes the mind. Order these ingrates to cease their dissonant echoings. Music is but a deviation from divine tranquillity. It must end. Peace will be achieved when the world is quiet. Peace will be achieved when the world is quiet. Peace will be achieved when..." As he repeats the phrase over and over again, he fades deeper and deeper back into the corner.

The Issue
While taking the subway to an important function in @@CAPITAL@@, you notice a woman complaining loudly to a particularly sweat-ridden man about the way he is sitting. They both notice you watching, and force you to take a stand on the issue.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, I've had to sit with this horrid vision for years, and I can't stand it!" yells a slightly red-in-the-face @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, an activist for women's rights. "If these men can't keep their legs together, they need to sit down and think about what they are doing! Send all men to mandatory 'how not to manspread' classes!" After she is done yelling at you, she immediately storms off to huff at another young man.

2. "Wait a minute!" counters @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, the sweaty man in question. "Let's all stretch our legs and calm down here! There's a reason we sit like this, you know. We sort of... have something down there. Besides, if I want to take a stretch, who's this woman to stop me? How about dividing public transit seats into women's and men's sections, tailored for the appropriate sitting needs for both sexes." The man picks up his bag and moves to find a better spot to sit.

3. "How about we just do away with the whole thing," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Cost Cutting, who just so happened to be taking the same train to work. "Instead of arguing over where to put our legs, let's use them for what they were intended for... walking! Let's save the government some money and derail the entire public transit system."

[b][anchor=1715]#1715[/anchor]: [Ostrovskiy; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
Oil and gas companies have discovered a legal oddity in @@NAME@@'s laws: property ownership over a piece of land is often split, with the surface belonging to one person, but the mineral rights to the resources below belonging to someone else, often the government, which occasionally sells off these mineral rights. The mineral owner's rights are dominant over the surface owner's, meaning that the mineral owner can freely use the surface to extract the resources beneath, with the construction of well drilling sites, access roads, and pipelines all permitted. Corporations have wasted no time buying up mineral rights and exploiting them.

The Debate
1. "That oil is mine by right, goddammit!" exclaims an old @@MAN@@ whose pool house was demolished to make room for a pipeline. @@HIS@@ daughter quickly interjects, "What she wants to say is that it is both unreasonable and unjust for our property and quality of life to be ruined by corporations despite the owner neither agreeing nor being compensated. It would be far more reasonable for surface and mineral rights to be combined and given to the current holder of the surface rights, even if it means these companies have to take the loss on all the money they've invested. If they want to drill, they'd better pay the proper owners!"

2. A slick spokesperson for a consortium of oil companies wastes no time drilling @@HIS@@ points into you: "While it is of course unfortunate what occurred to these people, everything was done according to the letter of the law. Everything was bought legitimately, and no property rights are technically being violated. Furthermore, the extraction of these resources will lead to oil money trickling down to every @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@, spilling oil wealth into our pockets. For that reason, surface and mineral rights should remain separate, and the government should auction off the remaining mineral rights it owns."

3. Your greasy-haired Minister of Energy spills his plan to you while sipping a milkshake, "@@NAME@@ clearly has an abundance of fossil fuels, and the government already owns the rights to these underground resources across @@NAME@@. Why give away the mineral rights to these corporations when the state can do the drilling itself? The new state-owned @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Oil Company will start drilling for oil and natural gas on properties all across the nation. Citizens might complain, but we'll invest all the profits in a sovereign wealth fund which, along with taxes on other oil companies, will fund pensions for all citizens!"

4. A party of prancing petroleum protesters postures and prates, "Protect the underground, @@LEADER@@! Do not allow these men to stick their painful pipes into Mother Earth! The underground is necessary for the above ecosystem to survive, and it is home to many noble lifeforms, such as worms and moles. The life of even one worm is worth more than a million barrels of oil. Zoning laws prevent you from building higher than a certain height — do the same thing for what's below the surface and restrict all new construction below a certain point."

The Issue 
A bunch of excitable scientists have burst into your office declaring that they are on the verge of a cure for mankind's greatest medical malady — male pattern baldness.

The Debate
1. "Ah, @@LEADER@@, it's great we've caught you!", shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, his ushanka dripping with sweat. "We've been researching this for decades, and spent a hair-raising amount on it, but we're on the fringes of a cure. All we need is a little more medical funding diverted our way, say from the tropical diseases, oncology and paediatric departments, and we're sure to overcomb — I mean overcome! — this scourge of mankind."

2. "Let's not split hairs about this," retorts your elderly major-domo @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Wiig, who is sporting a sumptuous mullet today. "We simply can't justify diverting funding from serious medical conditions for the sake of mere vanity, but perhaps the government could stretch to providing every gentleman with a selection of toupées?"

3. "Fortune favours the bald, mate!" chuckles Max Barry, who is paying very close attention to your decision here, which could be critical to the future of your nation. "Bald blokes can still be handsome, popular and successful — like me! Put an end to bad hair days — everyone should be bald."

The Issue 
In an effort to meet @@NAME@@'s climate treaty targets, the Department of Energy has assembled a proposal to divert water from a protected wetland and nature preserve to help power a hydroelectric dam, which would dramatically reduce @@NAME@@'s dependence on nonrenewable energy. Unfortunately, ecologists have determined that this would destroy the preserve.

The Debate
1. "Our international obligations are more important than some amphibious slimeballs!" grunts your Minister of Energy, while engaging in a literal tug-of-war with your Minister of the Environment. "By increasing our renewable energy production, we expand our energy production and get much closer to our treaty targets! Imagine how many more wetlands we could save just by sacrificing one. Now stop standing there and help me pull!"

*2. "Those 'slimeballs' are called 'Hairy-Backed @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Toads', and are critically endangered!" bellows your Minister of the Environment, yanking the Energy Minister off his feet and sending him flying into your desk. "Besides, there are also lots of toads, and skinks, and other types of frogs, and — look, the point is you can't claim to be protecting the environment if you're destroying the environment to make it happen. What would the other signatories say if they found out about this? You've got to hold firm on protecting our natural environments. I'm sure there's another way we can meet our treaty commitments. Say, by importing clean energy from abroad." [TBD]

**4. "I think we're all missing a golden opportunity here," your well-dressed Minister of Trade chimes in, ducking under the rope being yanked back and forth.

Those stinkin' wetlands aren't doing anything for us now, and if we build dams on all of the other rivers in @@NAME@@, we might even exceed our obligations, and could export some clean energy to boost our national coffers!

6. "If you open up that wetland and other rare ecosystems to tourists, you could leverage our environment while still preserving it," suggests an unusually helpful consultant, who discreetly filmed the entire scuffle from a dark corner of your office. "The influx of tourists would draw international attention to our incredible ecosystems, and then you could use the money to help out some of our less fortunate treaty partners in exchange for decreasing our own obligations. If you slide me some government subsidies, I'll even walk you through just how to do that. Now if you'll excuse me, I have an auction to run."

@@NAME@@ has been hit by an unprecedentedly massive swarm of Maxtopian Carpenter Ants — attracted to the nation by the largest heat wave in history — which are reportedly able to reduce a wooden cow to shavings in minutes. During a walk to take your mind off your increasingly brittle office, several concerned citizens have taken notice as they come to you with solutions.

The Debate
1. "You have to do something — my children can't sleep at night because of these ants!" clamors @@RANDOM_NAME@@, towing several young children on a leash as @@HE@@ flags you down. "You should pay exterminators to take care of them nationwide. It may be costly and time-consuming, but we can't let these cursed ants chew our homes into sawdust!"

"And we certainly don't want the deep state dousing us with their foul-smelling substances! Don't you dare tread on me just because some folks didn't plan ahead.
