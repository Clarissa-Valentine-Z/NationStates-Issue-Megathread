[b][anchor=660]#660[/anchor]: Are We Being Served? [Lancaster of Wessex; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A broad survey of retail customers conducted across @@NAME@@ has revealed increasingly dismay with shoddy customer service, with especial complaints about staff being rude and unhelpful. One leisurely morning you decide to go undercover, to collect opinions from staff in one of the nation's largest department stores: [i]Greys Brothers[/i].

The Debate
1. The elevator opens at the [i]Ladies and Gentlemen's Department[/i], and the floor manager - sporting a red carnation and identifying himself as Major @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ @@ANIMAL@@ - pushes his views on you. "Poor service? Blame the imbeciles who work here, the counter staff. They have had no proper education, many did not even graduate from university, let alone serve time in the military, like I did, heroically, in the Great Brasilistani War. If you want quality service to flourish, then compulsory military service will teach respect to these scallywags!"

2. After you extricate yourself, you engage in a brief chat with two floor staff who are just returning from their mid-morning coffee break, Betty Sugden and Wilberforce Inman. "The reason we're unhappy," declares Mrs. Sugden, "is because we are constantly late due to overcrowded buses and trains! Even if I'm one second late, I get told off for it! Is it any wonder that I'm so wound up that I snap at people? I'm so upset when I get home that I end up being mean to my poor pussy!" After an awkward pause, Mr. Inman interjects. "She means her cat. But she's right! With lives as hard as ours, it is any wonder that men swear? You should provide more transport, so that there's always an empty seat calling out [i]'I'm freeeee!'[/i] on the buses!"

3. As you make your way towards the elevator to leave, you are approached and then harangued by the elderly and curmudgeonly head of the Gent's section, a Mr. Ernest Stranger, and you briefly explain the reason for your visit. "Rude? RUDE? Who says we're rude! Get me a glass of water Mr. Inman!" He collapses into a chair. "I've been serving for over 35 years, I damn well don't need any advice on how to treat customers! In fact, if these customers don't meet [i]my[/i] standards, I should have the right to refuse to serve them, full stop - make it law! Now since you're not going to buy anything, you'll excuse me, I have to go put in my afternoon set of teeth."

[b][anchor=661]#661[/anchor]: Scouting For Boys, Girls... Anyone? [Golgothastan; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Scouts, a volunteer youth group that teaches boys and girls outdoor survival skills, are reporting sharply declining numbers. The organization's annual meet was attended by just seven and a half Scouts (as there was an unfortunate accident involving a canoe made out of recycled soup cans). Some within the community are urging the government to help revive interest in outdoor pursuits among young people.

The Debate
1. "Dear Leader, we humbly beg your favor!" is spelled out in woodcraft sign language on a poster decorated with pictures of tents, trees, and wild @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@. The Scout who brought the poster into your office begins to explain, "Scouting has really suffered from a lack of state support. We give back to the community, learn valuable life skills, and get to socialize with other young people, all in the spirit of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ patriotism. And with some government funding, maybe we could afford some slightly less frayed guide ropes for our climbing wall?"

2. "Scouting is a hobby, nothing more," grumbles notoriously @@CURRENCY@@-pinching auditor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What's next, are we going to start giving subsidies to model aircraft building clubs? Knitting circles? Mustache enthusiasts? Treasury funds are for essential projects only. If the Scouts can't get by without state support, then they should go out of business like any other private organization would."

3. "You're talking about ending a tradition of Scouting that goes back more than a century!" complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a military historian who has won several awards for exceptionally dry accounts of dramatic battles. "I got my start in fieldcraft as a Scout, just like many of our nation's greatest heroes. The young people of today don't know what they're missing out on. In fact, maybe if you forced them all to join the Scouts, they'd soon see what fun it was!"

4. "All this tradition stuff is exactly why kids aren't interested in Scouting anymore," snarks your appallingly cynical niece, who only looks up from her phone to roll her eyes. "What use are badges for campfire building and map reading when we have central heating and GPS? If Scouting taught some more modern skills, maybe you'd have more young people interested."

[5]. "If it's just a matter of money, then perhaps I can be of assistance?" oozes industrial magnate Kanya Yeats, looking up from an Ayn Bland e-book. "My firm has offered to sponsor the Scouts before, but unfortunately those pesky child safety laws have prevented us from offering them a truly rounded experience. What youngster wouldn't love the chance to go sailing in a MaxCorp-branded dinghy, or hiking in a pair of new Zephyr Holdings-sponsored walking boots! Or even gain a little practical experience and valuable life training volunteering at our steel mills?" [[color=red]Children may not work[/color]]

[b][anchor=662]#662[/anchor]: Playful Petitions Pester Politicians [Helaw; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A petition calling for you to wear nothing but swimming attire and a top hat during speeches and public events was discussed in detail by the government, including a fierce debate on which colours would suit you best. After updating your wardrobe, and feeling angry and somewhat embarrassed, you called for a meeting with your advisers to discuss how ridiculous petitions seem to have become.

The Debate
1. "Your fashion choices aside, these petitions are getting out of hand," claims a rather stressed-out aide after taking a nap on a mountain of petitions. "Not a day passes without me being inundated with senseless petitions, like asking us to ban breathing or to add whale surfing to the national curriculum. We should introduce petition curators to make sure that only the legitimate petitions make it through; they'll cut out the... less desirable ones."

2. "Why waste time with petitions anyway?" tuts one of your top staffers while absentmindedly shredding a petition to construct something called a 'Death Star'. "These petitions are a waste of everyone's time, and we'd be better off ignoring them. It's not like their opinions matter. We shouldn't concern ourselves with what - for instance - people think our public buildings should look like. Seriously, banana-shaped offices?"

3. "People have the right to sign some paper and complain about how things are being run," presses one of your more eager assistants, who dreams of becoming a politician one day. "It doesn't matter how ridiculous a petition may seem; it should be looked at in detail to see if it has merit, even if that requires extra work for us. There must be something useful to be found within them, surely..."

4. "I think this petition makes a very important point," argues your Minister of Making Things Look Good, who also happens to be your personal hairstylist. "You could really do with a makeover! Everyone knows that your approval ratings would absolutely skyrocket, and that your speeches would have a new lease of life to them. After all, if a petition calls for you to change your appearance, then obviously people think you'd look better that way."

[b][anchor=663]#663[/anchor]: A "Friend" In Need [Empire of Cats; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The aggressive nation of Blackacre has been struck with a series of massive natural disasters that have killed tens of thousands and destroyed sanitation, transit, and economic infrastructure, with the likely consequence of great suffering for millions in the coming months. This has presented you with the moral quandary of whether or not you should come to the aid of a nation that has frequently declared its hatred for @@NAME@@ and the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ way of life.

The Debate
1. "Well, it serves them darn well right!" shouts your infuriated Minister of Defense, furiously kicking your expensive imported mahogany desk and sending your papers flying. "An eye for an eye, I say! They insulted us multiple times, and they got what they deserved. As a matter of fact, now is the perfect time to truly pay them back for their slander of our great nation! They want aid? How about we aid them by sending some missiles aimed right at their capital? That'll show them!"

2. "Not that I don't agree with Mr. Compassionate over here, but that particular method only seems to stir up unwanted trouble," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@NAME@@'s top chess master and military strategist. "Frankly, there's a much better way of making our point without causing so much international outcry. Why not provide them aid, but so much of it that they become dependent on us for survival? Flood them with food, but do nothing to help their farmers. Supply them with power, but don't build power infrastructure. Then, when they've lost any capacity to support themselves, start charging them! We can look good internationally while secretly waging war against their economy."

3. "It's just too much effort these days to try to take over another country," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, former soldier and current aide to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. "For that matter, it's too much effort to even provide aid when we have so much to focus on here. Crime, poverty, resources, and all that. It's a shame what's happened, but we aren't the only nation in the world. Let's cut all aid. There's probably some other nation that'll be foolish enough to help them out, anyway."

4. "Regardless of what Blackacre's government's actions have been in the past, there are millions of innocent civilians who are going to be harmed or even killed," suggests your secretary while cleaning the mess of papers off your desk. "How would you feel if you were homeless and hungry, and others turned a blind eye? This is a humanitarian disaster. We need to send aid and do whatever we can to help. Helping them is the moral thing to do, and that's all there is to it."

[b][anchor=664]#664[/anchor]: Your Land Or Mine [Australian Repulic; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A large aluminium deposit has been found at @@ANIMAL@@ Hills, a remote area in @@NAME@@. The Environmental Agency is being unusually easy-going, citing minimal potential ecological impact and approving mining to go ahead. Only one obstacle exists - the deposit is right in the middle of a sacred area of the indigenous Pangaoaoangan tribe.

The Debate
1. "Did you know that aluminium is the second most commonly used metal in our economy, after steel?" quizzes aluminium afficionado and bauxite buff @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pointing to an 'Ask Me About Electrolysis' pin-badge proudly displayed on an ironed lapel. "This high quality deposit is a gold mine! Not literally of course, I'm just 'funning' with you. We're talking minimal tailings, starting at just minus 100 metres! Isn't that exciting? Oh my goodness, there's so much we can do when we have aluminium! Why hesitate?"

2. "@@LEADER@@, you must see it from our side," insists @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a tribal elder wearing a sharp business suit and a worker's hard hat. "Pullabooka - or as you call it - the @@ANIMAL@@ Hills, belongs to my people. You cut into it, and you're not just profaning a holy site, you're cutting us out of your society! Look, we're not blind to your economic needs: if you want to mine your metal, why not start seventy miles to the north instead, across that river canyon, then tunnel your way across to the deep deposits? A thousand generations of my ancestors are watching you, @@LEADER@@. Do the right thing!"

[3]. "That sounds kind of expensive... bit of a dealbreaker if we can't turn a profit," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a spokesperson from @@CAPITAL@@ Mining Company's Corporate Social Responsibility arm. "Look, we don't need to convince ALL the locals. Let's just convince the tribal council. They get a healthy inducement fee, say half from you and half from our company, and they can sign whatever papers we need to cover us from future legal challenges. I think, after all, money talks!"

[b][anchor=665]#665[/anchor]: In Nomine Ecclesia [Holy Oranz; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Troubled by the number of technophobic zealots, book burning fundamentalists, and knife-waving cultists constantly parading through your office, a coalition of concerned churchgoers are trying to remind you that organized religion can do good too.

The Debate
1. "Don't let the weirdos and extremists color your perception," pleads faith leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dropping a bushel of pamphlets and tracts into your in-tray. "Followers of @@RELIGION@@ help the people of our good nation with a multitude of community outreach programs. We don't need money, @@LEADER@@, but it'd set a great example to the people if you personally would head down to one of our shelters once a week to do some hands-on volunteer work, sing a few hymns, serve some soup to the homeless and hungry, that sort of thing. Just think, you could lead @@NAME@@ - or indeed all of @@REGION@@ - into a new age of altruism and charity!"

2. "Let's not forget the festivals and the songs of praise," adds @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an enthusiastic community volunteer with an acoustic guitar. "@@RELIGION@@ has always been at the heart of our nation's identity and culture, and I would say that the music is the route to brighter lives and stronger souls. I suggest you invest in a performance arena where we can all come together in celebration of the Divine. Who knows, it might even attract tourist pilgrims from far away lands."

3. "Now hear the testimony of a proud son of @@RELIGION@@," bellows televangelist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, entering your office through a cloud of laser-filled mist and to a backdrop of deafening music. "The purpose of religion in society is the purpose of salvation. Ask not what @@RELIGION@@ can do for your nation, but what you can do for @@RELIGION@@. Fund me, and I can broadcast our holy message all across @@REGION@@! Donate now, @@LEADER@@, and save your soul. Praise be! PRAAAAAAISE BE!"

4. "Couldn't help but overhear," interrupts @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a retired history teacher apparently on a tour of the building, poking her head through the door of your office, "but if you ask me, the separation of church and state is fundamental to modern government. Taxpayer money should never be given to religions or religious organizations - we must rid you of turbulent priests! After all, have you seen how many of these religious nutters are technophobic zealots, book-burners, or knife wielding cultists?"

[b][anchor=666]#666[/anchor]: A Microchip On Your Shoulder [Minoa; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Contactless payment, internet banking and robust consumer credit mechanisms are already making shopping easier than any time in history. However, a technology think tank is proposing that you could stimulate the economy by going one step further, with universal subcutaneous microchips linked to a national @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Identity Database.

The Debate
1. @@RANDONMFIRSTNAME@@ Tenhorn, head of the think tank, is enthusiastic. "No need for wallets or purses any more: just walk out with the goods, and your credit account is updated! Also, you could link medical data, GPS-tracking, biometrics data... the benefits are legion! I mean, we're not talking a barcode under your left eye or anything mad like that, just an unobtrusive digital implant, anywhere on the body. Oh brave new world, that has such gadgets in it!"

2. "We must reject the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Identity Database!" raves @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Apollyon, leader of the @@NAME@@ Resistance Against the Identity Database (@@NAME_INITIALS@@-RAID) campaign group. "In the name of 'national security', law-abiding citizens will end up being forced to lose their privacy. The right to use cash and hard currency is vital to protecting our rights to avoid taxat... uh... to avoid Orwellian monitoring!"

3. "That's not enough!" screams conspiracy theorist Jonty Apostle, adjusting his tinfoil hat to keep radio waves out of his brain. "Do you know how many databases there are out there gathering intelligence on us all? Credit reports, search engine histories, e-mail archives, medical records, criminal records, driving licences... All these little revelations, and you still think it's crazy when I say that we're always being watched? @@LEADER@@, give people back their freedom! Ban government and corporations from tracking our data in any way!"

*4. "Look, we want to keep tabs on our population, but do we really need to deal with all this outrage?" muses Lucy Fir, a promising junior delegate from the Ministry of Creative Solutions. "Why not secretly implant the microchips in newborn babies during routine postnatal checks and in adults during dental work? Sure, people won't be able to shop with a chip that they don't know is there, but in terms of national security and crime prevention, secret surveillance is far more effective than open monitoring."

[b][anchor=667]#667[/anchor]: One Man's Trash Is Another Man's Recyclable [Socialist Nordia; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A recent study by some self-righteous college students revealed that an alarming number of recyclable items are being thrown into the garbage. In order to bring more attention to this issue, a handful of particularly dedicated environmentalists - calling themselves 'Save Our Trash' - are camping out in the dumpster behind your home. They claim that they will not leave until the government takes action.

The Debate
1. "How can people care so little for Mother Earth?" grouses a grouchy, green-haired man named Oscar, who has taken up residence in one of your trash cans. "The government needs to do a hell of a lot more to inform people about the importance of recycling. You should throw everything you've got at the problem: public service announcements, sorting classes for the kids, bins in every conceivable place. You could even fine those lazy people who refuse to properly dispose of recyclables."

2. "There's no reason to punish @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ when industry bears most of the blame for pollution," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while struggling to open a hard plastic stay-fresh shell containing a pre-peeled banana. "By taxing inefficient manufacturers for all of this ridiculously excessive packaging, the government could discourage commercial waste and even make itself some money. Hey, an environmentalist policy that generates revenue - now there's an idea."

3. "Meh. Is this really such a big deal?" yawns city worker @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, finishing off his tea in a delicate porcelain cup, before throwing the whole thing into the nearest garbage can. "Being neurotic over trash just makes people unhappy and forces them to feel guilty about shopping. You should actually be encouraging people to throw stuff away without thinking too hard about it - a culture of disposable items drives consumption, which in turn makes for a strong economy. And that's what matters."

[b][anchor=668]#668[/anchor]: How To Examine Your Testees [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
At the International Conference of Education, head-teachers and education ministers generally have a drink or ten and get a chance to meet their peers from across the world. The conference happens to be in @@NAME@@ this year and having nothing better to do one night, you decide to attend a mixer. As it happens, the topic of conversation is Standardised Testing...

The Debate
1. Dàguó Education Director Hoo Yu Wan Hia, apparently misunderstanding the nature of the social-mixer, has set up a projector upon a platter of hors d'oeuvres and is currently word-for-word reading off PowerPoint slides. "In Dàguó, standardised tests assess student performance throughout education. Centile-scoring streams the students, gives accurate comparison, and identifies the cream of the crop for industry roles. Next slide, please. This is the foundation of economic success, and also why Dàguó children are so much better at maths and science than the lazy and undisciplined children of your nations. You should adopt the Dàguó system. Any questions?"

2. "Constant testing teaches children only how to pass tests," interjects Antti Markkanen, a progressive head teacher from the socialistic nation of Skandilund, carefully putting down his drink. "Obsession with competition only makes children equate success with dominance. Use carrot and stick methods, and you just get an ass. Pun intended. When children compete, most are taught only that they are losers. Abandon testing, and teach love of knowledge!"

3. "So on the one hand we got rote-learning clones, and on the other, liberal hippies!" spits cowboy-hat wearing Jonnie Wain, interrupting his poker game to literally and metaphorically put his cards on the table. "In the United Federation we got a saying: [i]'Hey Guvmint! Butt out!'[/i]. Let each school be its own business, deciding its own way with no centralized tyranny. Let parents vote with their wallets, and either pick the school they want, or pick no school at all. I was raised on my uncle's farm; I just learned me how to herd steers from the back of a horse. That's real life education!"

4. "Couldn't we be a bit more moderate, try and take something of all three options?" wonders your Education Minister, trying to escape from the trio of foreign educators closing in on her. "Maybe there's a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ way, with compulsory exam assessments, but not a national test, but a choice of examination boards competing on the free market. And maybe you could have some state schools with part private funding, and some private schools with state regulation, and some structured home schooling involving some time in communal classrooms. That sounds good, doesn't it? Maybe? Possibly?"

The Issue
As residential rooftop solar is increasing in popularity, @@NAME@@ Gas and Electric (@@NAME_INITIALS@@G&E) has begun to offer resistance to the current billing structure, complaining that households' electric bills are so low they can no longer afford to maintain the grid. As rhetoric on all sides has become increasingly high voltage, @@NAME_INITIALS@@G&E is asking you to approve a change in their fee structure.

The Debate
1. CEO Joule Ohm of @@NAME_INITIALS@@G&E sweeps the papers off your desk, slams down his proposed fee structure, and then begins to speak, "If we are to maintain the grid while keeping power affordable for the poor, there has to be a change to the system. We need a flat grid fee charged monthly to all households regardless of energy use. With a grid fee, we can reduce the per kilowatt usage fee, so most users will hardly notice the difference."

2. "I couldn't think of a better plan to kill my business!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the amped-up CEO of Sol Invictus, @@NAME@@'s biggest rooftop solar installation company. "If the power company charges you a huge fee no matter how much power you use, who will want solar panels? I have a bright solution. If @@NAME_INITIALS@@G&E needs more money, let them raise the per kilowatt usage fees for everyone. But we need electricity meters in every household to track energy usage and whether homes with solar panels are producing surplus power to sell back to the grid. Let's let the market determine the price of power!"

3. "I could think of a better way to kill solar." wheezes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the octogenarian CEO of Relaxed Diamond Coal Company. "Ban it! Rooftop solar panels are eyesores, and they're driving out @@NAME@@'s mom and pop coal companies. No more, I say! We're blessed with plentiful coal deposits; let's use them to make cheap, local power. As for those global warming alarmists, why, the weatherman can't even predict tomorrow's weather, never mind the weather 50 years from now."

4. "This problem needs a solution grasped from the future, not grounded in the industrial revolution!" declares celebrity green-energy venture capitalist Melon Husk. "My company is beginning to develop initial prototypes for large-capacity home-use batteries. However, to make this viable in the near future, we just need a smidgen of government subsidies for research and production. I think the batteries we'll develop will be affordable and, combined with solar panels, they'll almost certainly be able to provide households with their energy demands. I'm pretty sure we can make power lines a thing of the past!"

The Debate
1. "We have to balance safety with helping people who are just looking for a better life," states Minister of Internal Affairs, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, while drinking her half-full cup of coffee. "Why don't we just carefully screen potential refugees to see if they have any connections to terrorists?

The Issue
While perusing the grand governmental libraries for the popular graphic novel, "Jee, Gnomes!", you come across numerous documents pertaining to the field of genetic engineering – manipulating the genetic code that dictates the characteristics of all biological life. In a barely comprehensible scientific paper, you read of a proposal to allow the patenting of DNA sequences. Realising that the government has yet to take an official stance, you call together a number of experts in the field that are willing to debate the topic.

The Debate
1. "Researchers work long and hard to understand these genes," claims the CEO of Dynalixa Technologies, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It is simply immoral to tell these scientists that they cannot patent the sequences that they have located and researched, and the notion that the government is willing to make the untold numbers of second best currencies poured into this sector worthless is simply absurd. Enforcement and limitations aside, I am certain that allowing gene patents is the best way forward."

2. "This is pure, unadulterated madness!" cries renowned biologist Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, in a sudden outburst that sends a model fish flying. "You can't just patent the language of life itself! Look, as much as private firms may wish to protect their developments in this field, they have no right to stop others from using them; the law must reflect this. While you're at it, you should seek to subsidise all genetic research; after all, the nation could use more people who know the difference between mRNA and tRNA!"

3. "Both of you are going too far," pipes up your Minister of Science, wielding a helix-shaped pen. "The solution is simple. To prevent people from being sued over their DNA, perhaps we should make patenting genes that are found in nature illegal, while ensuring that artificially created genes are open for companies to argue with each other over. While this could prove quite restricting for some companies, it should theoretically protect the average consumer, while preventing companies in the industry from completely losing the right to patent their research."

4. "Gene editing? Compromises? Come on," says your exhausted and agitated secretary, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while handing you a cup of coffee. "All of this hullabaloo could be avoided by just getting rid of it all. I'm quite happy being me, and I don't think anyone has the right to poke around in my code. All of these sciencey folk can just jog on."

2. "It's not our fault," sighs bedraggled geologist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, pushing her glasses back onto her nose. "The problem is that we're poorly funded and under-equipped.

Brancalandian pop star Bryan Leeper has gotten into trouble with the law yet again while on tour in @@NAME@@. He was caught urinating on a fire hydrant, making this his tenth arrest in the past year.

2. "We don't want the little brat back!" declares the Brancalandian Foreign Minister, seen smashing Bryan Leeper CDs with a hockey stick. "I bumped into the Maxtopian ambassador on my way here. It seems that Mr. Leeper has an outstanding legal issue over in Maxtopia that could involve jail time if he's found guilty. Why not extradite him there as a diplomatic move? What's that? Well yes, Maxtopia has the death penalty. I'm sure he hasn't done anything that serious there."

3. "All I need, is your love, your love, my love, your love, youuuuuuu!" sings your teenage niece's best friend, who is also president of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Bryan Leeper Fan Club. "You can't send him away! He's a troubled young artist trying to find his way. His message is pure and sweet and he's, like, so totally dreamy. Listen!" She starts to sing again as secret service men usher her out of the room. "Baby, baby, don't leave me alone, don't walk awa...." Unfortunately, you've heard enough to have the song stuck in your head all day. It really is catchy.

[b][anchor=674]#674[/anchor]: Let Them Eat Rainbow Cake! [Galway-Dublin; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
When high-profile lesbian celebrity Ellen Lynch was asked to leave popular establishment [i]@@CAPITAL@@ Diner[/i], it was made clear to her that this was because she was dining with her lesbian partner. The restaurant owners refused to serve the homosexual couple, citing a conflict with their religious beliefs. This isn't the first time something like this has been flagged by the press, but Lynch is keen to make some noise.

The Debate
1. "I have the right to my values!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the diner owner. "My grandfather, who opened this restaurant 50 years ago, was a man of faith. This faith gave him his love of family values and family dining. He believed homosexuality to be degenerate and sinful! I'm not saying that these people can't sin in their own homes, but must I sit there watching them commit unholy acts in my business? What about my freedom to express religious belief? What about my economic rights as a business owner?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

2. "I have the right to my values!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the manager of the diner. "My grandfather, who opened this restaurant 50 years ago, was a man of faith. This faith gave him his love of family values and family dining. He believed homosexuality to be degenerate and sinful! I"m not saying that these people can"t sin in their own homes, but must I sit there watching them commit unholy acts in my business? What about my freedom to express religious belief? What about my economic rights as a state-licensed business operator?" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

3. "We remain a minority whose voice never gets heard!" exclaims Ellen Lynch, on her nationally syndicated talk show. "It is my hope that the government enforces protection of LGBT individuals in these kinds of situations by forcing businesses to serve anyone, regardless of their sexuality. Religious bigotry has no place at our tables!"

4. The Deputy Mayor of @@CAPITAL@@, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ strides in, dashingly pink trench coat flapping in the breeze behind him. "The mayor won't like this, but if we want @@NAME@@ to be a prestigious and progressive nation on the world stage, we've got to go even further! To cater for... that is to protect the rights of the gay community, we should establish zones in each restaurant or other service industry venture that are reserved exclusively for gay and lesbian people. Think of our standing in the international gay community! Think of the tourism! We'd be a shining beacon for gay culture!"

[b][anchor=675]#675[/anchor]: Trick Or Treaty [Ransium; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
After lengthy political wrangling, a global treaty on reducing greenhouse gas emissions has been put on the table. World powers such as Brancaland, Blackacre and Dàguó have moved to ratify the treaty, and the heat is on for @@NAME@@ to make a decision.

The Debate
1. "Only through coordinated international action can we deal with the crisis of climate change," preaches @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has spent the better part of a decade as @@NAME@@'s lead negotiator for the treaty. "The emissions reduction targets in this treaty are achievable, and affordable. @@LEADER@@, for our children's future, we must ratify this treaty."

2. "What mankind does has no bearing on whether the weather is warm," rants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a columnist at the think-tank [i]Convenient Truths[/i]. "Ratifying this treaty would be economic suicide, and it's well-known that the threats of so-called 'climate change' have been exaggerated by countries like Dàguó in order to cripple our economy. You must refuse to ratify this treaty!"

3. "You know, I was beginning to warm up to this treaty," argues hot-headed environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "But then, I got to the proposed emissions reduction targets: they're pathetic! We do need to set an international example, but not by ratifying this worthless treaty. Instead, we must pass national legislation that properly addresses the magnitude of our problem. Like, oh I don't know, an eighty percent reduction of all emissions by next Tuesday."

4. "All this has me thinking," muses @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@, an economics professor specializing in game theory, who is simultaneously playing chess with your aide. "The emissions reductions would impact our economy, but not ratifying the treaty would adversely affect our international reputation. I noticed that the compliance verification provisions are quite... lax. So let's ratify, do some lip-service, and then forget about it. It'll give us a competitive advantage." With a flourish, she moves her queen across the chessboard, "Check and mate!"

[b][anchor=676]#676[/anchor]: Down The Rabbit Hole [Wyethalania; ed: Wyethalania][/b]

The Issue
After numerous cases of brief delirium were reported in the countryside, local scientists and health officials have narrowed down the potential causes to a hallucinogenic toxin produced by a microbe that normally incubates within rabbits. Apparently, the close contact rural farmers had with tainted rabbit excrement resulted in their delusions. In response, several apoplectic and assertive citizens have accosted you while on your morning stroll to deal with the issue.

The Debate
1. "This is ridiculous," shouts avid home gardener Alice Cheshire. "I can't even tend my own flower beds without falling into a psychedelic trance! If I hallucinate one more rabbit wearing a waistcoat and a pocket watch, I'm gonna lose it. We must eradicate this menace, even if it means killing all the rabbits in @@NAME@@! OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!"

2. "Whoa, whoa, whoa... Let's not be too hasty here," interjects microbiologist and pharmaceutical spokeswoman Anita Plaseebeau. "This rabbit colon-based microbe gives us a rare and profitable opportunity to further both our understanding of biology and medicine. Throw a little funding our way, and we can trap some live specimens, analyze the microbe up close, and get all of Pencil Sharpeners hooked on it by Sunday."

3. "You all keep missing the point! These aren't just hallucinations caused by poop, they're gifts from the Great Rabbit Goddess!" asserts escaped mental patient and neopagan Sybil @@ANIMAL@@-McGee wearing her ceremonial rabbit-patterned robe and bunny slippers. "Through consuming the rabbits' sacred defecation, we are blessed with miraculous visions of the future! Heed my prophecies, and I'll get @@NAME@@ on the right path in no time." After swallowing a handful of rabbit droppings, she twitches awkwardly on the ground while sputtering ill-fated prognostications.

[b][anchor=677]#677[/anchor]: Dial L For Loan [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
After a recent unfortunate incident involving a foreign casino, a gambling addicted crime lord, and a secret agent that was a bit too confident in his poker playing abilities, the government is currently strapped for cash. Your Finance Minister has reminded you of a swathe of delinquent government loans made to a small nameless nation in your sphere of influence that could be called in to close the budget gap.

The Debate
1. "If they can't pay up, why we'll get a @@REGION@@ tribunal involved!" declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Finance Minister. "Start by removing their spendthrift leadership, and install a stooge, er... someone who understands the gravity of their international obligations. Next, forcibly privatize some of the most easily monetized state services. Why, I bet some of@@NAME@@'s businesses might even be interested in buying them."

2. "How soft!" mutters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leader of the infamous 'Loan and Pool Shark' mercenaries, while menacingly holding a pool cue. "It's time you went full repo man on these money squanderers and take what's owed to you. They won't dare to object to a few of their warships, crown jewels, or national treasures going to the cause."

3. "A thousand pardons @@LEADER@@!" pleads the country's ambassador, Owen Dett, while kissing your feet. "Although our nation is a mere insignificant speck of dirt compared to the might and majesty of your nation, we implore you to find it within your heart to forgive the debts of us, the most 'umblest of nations."

[b][anchor=678]#678[/anchor]: A Motion For Seconds [Zwangzug; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
Today you've had a full schedule: meeting lobbyists who want you to name lunch the most important meal of the day, handshaking and congratulating @@NAME@@'s gold-medal-winning @@ANIMAL@@ball team, and fielding surprisingly piercing questions from a classroom of carefully selected ten-year-olds. It's been hard for you to attend to the business of state, much less find any time for yourself. It occurs to you that having a deputy leader to help handle the workload might not be such a bad idea.

The Debate
1. "Voters don't discriminate between heads of state or, wait for it, their running mates," explains Erin Splinter, a rising star within your party. "And we'll keep winning, so why not have a second-in-command aboard? Someone whose ideology you understand, but who increases your demographic appeal, be they @@DEMONYM@@ or Bigtopian. You're gonna need a right-hand man, or woman." She kisses a gauntlet of babies on her way out of your office.

2. "Whaaat?" The leader of the opposition sneezes for emphasis. "Did I miss something here, or are we still a democracy? The runner-up should be the deputy, so they can go watch, oh, rap battles and stuff and get in touch with the little people. Creative dissent is what makes @@NAME@@ strong!"

3. "We don't really need a deputy leader, do we?" muses dedicated method actor Alex Miranda, who boasts an eerie resemblance to you. "Whenever you need to take a break, I'll go argue about banks or mourn at generals' funerals." Miranda adjusts a duelling cane and a pair of glasses. "I think I've got your accent down, too! [i]@@SLOGAN@@![/i]"

4. "As if anyone else in the room could accomplish as much as you," scoffs your personal assistant, trying not to overload you with your calendar for the next week. "You'll just have to work nonstop and struggle every second, but that should be no problem for you, @@LEADER@@! @@NAME@@ will still be a strong central democracy even if you're booked day and night."

[b][anchor=679]#679[/anchor]: Space Is Big Enough For The Both Of Us [Drayxaso; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
In a shocking turn of events, the normally secretive East Lebatuck government proposed working with multiple space programs. They have offered to work with the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Space Agency to create a jointly-operated space station, called the Multinational Space Station, or MSS. The scientific community has concluded that a space station would be utterly cool and might even provide the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Space Agency with valuable scientific data, but some are concerned about working with East Lebatuck.

The Debate
1. "Comrade @@LEADER@@, there is no reason for any mistrust between us," comments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the East Lebatuckese representative, while discreetly placing a listening device under a pot plant. "Our proposal would launch @@NAME@@'s space program to new heights while setting a glorious example of friendship between our two great Motherlands. We're ready to launch the 'Spyonya' module, so just hurry up and agree to build the station already."

2. "A jointly-operated space station might be one small step for international cooperation, but our own space station would be a giant leap for @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@kind," declares hero astronaut Hum Legstrong, who has arrived wearing a space suit for reasons you cannot fathom. "All we need to do is repurpose some leftover parts from the last few spaceship programs. Fuel tank? Bam, crew quarters! Spy Satellite? Bam, space telescope! We'll get all the sciencey goodness for a low, low price, and we won't have to trust those shady East Lebatuckese."

3. "A space station? Really?" remarks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an unpopular and rather frugal politician, nibbling at a homemade peanut butter sandwich. "Those nerds may act satisfied, but they'll just be begging for more funding next week. Take a page from Maxtopia's book and slash @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Space Agency's budget. We might get less of that 'science' stuff, but who cares? No one, because they'll be too busy enjoying the tax cut. It's not like space is going anywhere."
