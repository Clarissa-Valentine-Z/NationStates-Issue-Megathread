[b][anchor=500]#500[/anchor]: Please Don't Feed The (Copyright) Trolls [The-CID; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Major film studio Werner Cousins recently began enforcing its copyright on the popular "Merry Birthday" song and has been demanding that everyone from schools, to small children, to your own government, pay royalties for its use. After one of the studio's lawyers threatened to sue your secretary's daughter for royalties, your government has finally agreed to address the issue of copyright trolling.

The Debate
1. "It's quite simple," comments Werner Cousins' notorious lawyer @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, with a team of well-dressed yes men behind him. "The holders of a copyright have every right to demand royalties for its use and remove all unlicensed use. Of course, you can still sing the Merry Birthday song to your kids every year; just remember to pay us instead of wasting your money on another pair of designer running shoes for little Timmy."

2. "I want my Mommy to sing Merry Birthday to me... and to give me a new bicycle!" yells the visibly upset young girl as she smashes priceless family heirlooms on your desk. "Don't listen to that evil lawyer; it's not his song. It's my song because it's my birthday! Everybody should sing Merry Birthday if they want to!" The girl begins reading a cue card handed to her by her mother. "All culturally significant songs should be put into the public domain."

3. "Why should we deal with copyright at all?" suggests longtime political activist Red Foreman as he hands out copies of [i]The Little Pinko Book[/i] to everyone in the room. "Nationalize the work of any author, including songs, movies, trademarks and even designs. Creativity is an important educational function, and the bourgeois copyright trolls have no right to censor it. Once the work is popular enough, it should be released into the public domain. Sure, some artists and creators might lose that financial incentive to create, but at least this copyright problem will be a thing of the past!"

4. "How about a system that allows fair use of copyrighted material, such as for satire and education?" muses popular WhoTube celebrity and free speech activist The Nostalgia Nerd. "This protects copyright creators from outright theft, but protects us smaller creators from censorship from the big guys. "There's a chance Werner Cousins might try to exploit it, but freedom of speech is at risk here. Surely these big studios can handle a few choice criticisms? Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to review [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Apocalypse 4: The Rise of Mad Max![/i]"

[b][anchor=501]#501[/anchor]: Munchkins In Makeup [Leninkrav; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
After the surprisingly popular Little Miss @@NAME@@ Pageant was revealed to contain a pole dancing competition, concerned parents have been protesting the very existence of child beauty pageants. After weeks of moral outrage and increasingly annoying megaphone chants, you finally agreed to call a megaphone-free meeting regarding this latest controversial issue.

The Debate
1. "Have you ever sat down and watched these travesties?" screeches perpetually offended activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while thrusting tabloid magazines featuring child models in your face. "They're absolutely disgusting and must be banned. They parade these poor girls around in makeup and skimpy dresses like hussies! These pageants teach them that they're nothing more than helpless sex objects for the pleasure of male viewers! They're overly sexualized, immoral, and are just plain stupid as an entertainment form."

2. "What a load of baloney," scoffs former child model and pageant aficionado Catherine Gratwick, as she poses for your personal photographer. "These competitions are more than just bathing suits and giant hairdos. They teach girls important life skills, like discipline, talent development, and bribing officials. I loved being in beauty pageants as a child and I turned out just fine! The government should quit trying to force its morals on children. That's what parents are for."

3. "Who watches this stuff anyway?" groans local violence junkie, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, while leaning back in your chair and kicking his feet up on your desk. "Why don't we get rid of these boring kiddie pageants and replace them with something more exciting? Three words: child fight clubs. We can hold bare knuckle, rules-free battles between the little brats and televise the ensuing mayhem. It will teach them physical fitness, good sportsmanship, and uh...look, it'll just be really sweet, okay?"

[b][anchor=502]#502[/anchor]: Scientists Declare That @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ Are Persons [Ras Sambekki; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
Recent research into @@ANIMAL@@ intelligence reveals that they have several characteristics associated with human intelligence. There is apparently evidence of advanced object permanence, capacity for empathy, self-awareness, problem solving, and even a language system. Voices in @@NAME@@ are now demanding that the government should grant them legal personhood.

The Debate
1. "These animals are both sentient and intelligent," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Council for the Study of Animal Intelligence, while desperately trying to play Scrabble with @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@. "In all important ways they meet our standards for personhood. The government must therefore declare them legal persons with some basic civil rights. That means no more cages, needles or circus shows; they must have full bodily liberty." He looks down at the board: "Hey, wait a minute, 'DEAT' isn't a word!"

*2. "You're not seriously going to listen to this quack, are you?" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Great Big Bahpoo of the Cult of Cyan, a religious group so esoteric they make Violetism seem straightforward. "So what if @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ are intelligent? Were they given dominion over the earth and all its inhabitants? No, those things were given to us, humanity. These animals are here to cater to our basic needs, like eating, carrying heavy loads, or teaching them how to juggle and selling them to the circus. @@ANIMAL@@ personhood? What blasphemy. You'd be better off stripping them of any 'animal' rights they have today." [[color=purple]Must not ban Religion[/color]]

*3. "You're not seriously going to listen to this quack, are you?" shouts Sokka Exotic, better known as the @@ANIMAL@@ King. "So what if @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ are intelligent?

**4. "Don't listen to that human supremacist," quips @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ of the Animal Liberation Front, while donning a ski-mask and grabbing her bolt cutters. "However, merely granting @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ personhood is not going far enough.

The Issue
After countless people barged into your office through the front door, never mind the window, your door has become quite dilapidated. You decided to hold a small meeting on how to fix the problem, and now your office is filled with people holding surprisingly strong opinions regarding such a minor topic.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, how can you stand working in an office with a door barely attached to its hinges? People are going to think our nation is as broken as this door!" exclaims your secretary, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, after clearing away today's new petitions. "You need a brand new door. Oh! How about a rich Marche Noirian Mahogany? It would have beautiful ornamentation filled with national symbolism. Maybe we could replace the drapes while we're at it. That's sure to make @@NAME@@ look great again! Well, at the very least, your office will."

2. "'I see random people of no importance barging in to your office and dumping all of their problems on your desk for you to handle!" shouts your head of security, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while slamming the remainder of the office door. "Let me beef up your security here and install a sturdy iron door. Then only people with worthy issues will seek your counsel."

3. "That's too old school!" interjects @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, your nerdy niece. "Why not install a force field door? It could glow neon blue and look so cool and stuff! Force fields probably aren't radioactive, right?"

*4. "Why not make yourself a little spending money?" suggests wealthy industrialist Edward Rump as he adjusts his toupee.

[b][anchor=504]#504[/anchor]: Short Shorts Too Short? [Luger; ed: Sleep][/b]

The Issue
Dress codes for young women are in the news again after a violent clash between parents on opposite sides of the issue. The ringleaders have been dragged into your office by your Minister of Education for an impromptu arbitration and time-out.

The Debate
1. "My daughter was sent home from her school because of her shorts," exclaims @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, mother of two young teenage girls who look more like college students. "They said that her clothing was distracting the boys and lowering grades. What a bunch of sexist nonsense! Why are you people so fixated with what girls wear? These weak-minded boys need to learn some self-control before they enter the workforce."

2. @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, red-faced father of two sons, approaches your desk while your guards eye him cautiously. "Her dang daughter was wearing shorts so short you could see her gosh-darn gluteal fold! If she dressed like that downtown, she'd be attacked! You need to ban these shorts for the good of the youth of @@NAME@@."

[3]. "This God-fearing man is right, but we need to go even further!" says angry street preacher, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was not even invited to this meeting. "We must make all women cover up from the wrist to the ankle! In fact, to reduce temptation, we should just issue proper uniforms for everyone. Those who disobey the dress code should face public trial and shaming." [[color=purple]Must not be atheist[/color]]

4. Finally, fifteen year old @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ sits down at your desk, barely looking at you while she types vigorously at her smartphone. "Jeez, like, get off my back. I can, like, wear whatever I want. Boys are so stupid sometimes. Look at these shorts; they're even patriotic!" She stands up and does a twirl to show her short shorts are in your national colours with @@NAME@@ emblazoned across the backside. "Pretty nice right?" She smacks her gum loudly, takes a selfie, and goes back to texting.

[b][anchor=505]#505[/anchor]: Florists Blooming Mad [Drasnia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Bigtopian Balsam - an invasive weed with an extremely short gestation period, rapid growth, and hallucinogenic properties - has infested the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ hillsides. After smothering endangered wildflowers and crop-laden fields alike, an unlikely coalition of environmentalists and business owners have petitioned the government for action.

The Debate
1. "These damn weeds are out of control!" shouts the nation's leading basket-weaving magnate, who insists on being called the Basketcase. "They've completely destroyed my bamboo crop and are overrunning everything else! The government needs to back off with these pesticide regulations and let us handle this problem ourselves."

2. "For once I agree with my money-grubbing colleague here in theory," replies your constantly overlooked Minister of the Environment, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I disagree in methodology. All those nasty pesticides and chemicals would do colossal and irreversible damage to the environment. How about we set up a jobs program to remove the weeds and reseed the earth? It'll be a little costly, but hey, we'll be helping the environment and tackling unemployment! Talk about killing two @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ with one stone!"

3. "Eureka!" exclaims drug dealer-turned-scientist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Bigtopian Balsam's growth is astounding! Imagine if we utilized their genes for other crops, like wheat or corn? We could plant and harvest it within a month, feeding all of @@NAME@@. That means no more importing foodstuffs from other countries! There might be a tiny chance of psychotropic side-effects, but that's nothing compared to the economic benefits!"

4. "Use the genes for food? HA!" laughs controversial military scientist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@ who, for some odd reason, has been by your side since the beginning. "Bigtopian Balsam is the perfect bio-weapon that can wipe out our enemies' agriculture! Our extensive research shows that Bigtopian Balsam has been successful in the 'accidental' contamination of a few localized sites. We need more funding to begin immediate construction of a payload delivery system and your authorization for its approval. There's no chance of retaliation either - our enemies will be too doped up to care!"

The Issue
A research project conducted by the @@DENONYMADJECTIVE@@ Institute of People Studies found that marriages in other countries do indeed "seem to work," unlike previously thought. The sociologists published the results in The Highbrow Journal of People Watching, causing quite a stir in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "See? SEE? I told you I was right!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your number one fan, who weekly sends you letters promising eternal love and devotion. "Matrimony is a storied social tradition that helps build family cohesion. It's the ultimate public declaration of love, a human right, even. People should be allowed to marry whoever they like, whatever they like, whenever they like it! On that note, will you marry me?"

2. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a bureaucrat notorious for bed-hopping, retorts, "That's ridiculous. Marriage was banned because it served no purpose besides restricting personal freedom. Instead we should implement public courses on the efficacy of the marriage ban, starting from an early age. @@DENONYMPLURAL@@ must know that we as a nation promote freedom, OF EVERY KIND!"

3. "There's another way to look at it!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted eccentric. "The main cause of failed marriages then, and failed relationships now, is simply stupid people making dumb choices! Legalize marriage, but make sure that engaged couples have to pass tests like leaping over the Flames of Wedlock or facing Cupid's Arrows! That way only those truly in love will get married."

The Issue
A newly-founded religious group, Vive la chèvre, has vigorously protested the government's hard line against dairy farming

The Debate
1. "It's edam shame that cheese isn't a delicious sector of our economy!" declares the fanatical Val Taleggio, who appears to have constructed clothing out of a variety of dairy products. "Cheese is love. Cheese is life. We must force people to eat cheese, regardless of their dietary problems, so everyone can learn to love one another in the name of dairy. Otherwise poor souls will live forever provolone." He then starts building a shrine of cheese around your desk.

2. "Cry me a river of cow's milk. Cheese is an offense to our culture and everything we stand for, ¡No Parmesan!" decries perpetually confused anti-fascist and lifelong turophobe Jack Monterey. "It's a vile and disgusting food that at least .02% of @@NAME@@'s population believes to be immoral. The masses have spoken: cheese must be caerphilly removed from every corner of @@NAME@@."

3. "Surely there's potential for a compromise between those two emmental cases," says Chippy Cheesie, president of Marche Noire's biggest dairy firm. "Cheese is a promising sector of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ economy with huge potential for growth. It would be awful gouda you to spend a few tax @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to help build up a dairy industry from scratch.

[b][anchor=508]#508[/anchor]: Ex-Cons Robbed Of Future [Leninkrav; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Labor lawyers and armchair activists alike have been in an uproar after an ex-convict was denied a job at Discriministas, a popular five-star restaurant in downtown @@CAPITAL@@. The woman, whose only crime was jaywalking, now faces a lifetime of poverty and unemployment. After your Twitcher page was overwhelmed with angry complaints, you agreed to finally discuss whether or not ex-cons can be discriminated against.

The Debate
1. "I thought the purpose of prison was to prepare criminals for reintegration into society?" queries sociology professor @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ casually stroking his beard. "Yet here we are telling them that they aren't allowed to work. People make mistakes, they learn, they move on. Why should this woman's career be destroyed because of a stupid mistake she made ages ago? This sort of blatant discrimination ought to be banned!"

2. "That's easy for you to say, professor high-and-mighty," scoffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the snobby owner of Discriministas, who has been the subject of protests and angry Twitcher rants. "You don't have to put up with consequences of hiring a shady ex-con! How can you expect me to run my business when I have to worry about thieving employees stealing tips and customers' wallets? I should be able to reject any applicant for any reason, be it legal history, work experience, or just because they look funny. Would you want some creepy sex offender working in a daycare or an ax murderer working at a hardware store? I didn't think so. Criminal records must be readily available to any employer who requests them."

3. "Obviously we need to reach some sort of compromise here," suggests team-building consultant @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while trying to get your reluctant aides to do a trust fall. "It does seem cruel to deny people jobs for petty crimes they committed years ago, but we need to ensure the safety of the business and the customers. How about a system that allows business owners to conduct record checks for more sensitive jobs, such as teaching schoolchildren, law enforcement, or working in your office? Nobody would understandably hire a murderer or a sex offender for those positions, but at the same time minor crimes like jaywalking and that ridiculous law about kicking a can six times in a row shouldn't ruin a person's life." One of your aides suddenly falls on the floor and lets out a string of profanities.

4. "It seems to me that my fellow law-abiding citizens are misinformed on the situation here," says local mob boss, Morbidly Obese Tony, as he casually saunters into your office. "You see, a great number of my friends have been wrongfully detained for crimes they did not commit. I don't much appreciate that. Next time your flatfoots want to lock up one of my pals, hows about they just look the other way, capisce? I'm sure a few well placed bribes or threats can convince these corporate big wigs to see the error of their ways. If you disagree... well, it sure would be a shame if an accident were to occur here today." Tony then looks around your office and sets his sights on your prized antique golden @@ANIMAL@@ statue.

The Issue
Experts are pleading for you to act on the proposed disposal of the cheap and easy to produce wonder-material asbestos, previously universally used in construction, after a recent investigation concluded that the material is highly carcinogenic when breathed as particulates.

The Debate
1. "There are ticking time bombs sitting in the walls of every office, house, school and workplace throughout @@NAME@@, just waiting for somebody to nudge them," drawls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your public health minister, slamming a ludicrously thick file onto your desk, "And we're actually obtuse enough to waste our time investigating methods of making headway?! We must organize disposal teams and fund an emergency information campaign as soon as possible! Damn the cost and the manpower, thousands of lives are at stake!"

2. "Well..." begins @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, your director of medical research, rapping her knuckles against your office wall, and emitting a cloud of dust in the process. "The alarming health implications of asbestos must certainly be dealt with, and the materials removed. But you'd still be closing the stable door after the @@ANIMAL@@ has bolted. We seem to be avoiding the issue of treatment for those already suffering the effects of long-term exposure of asbestos. I propose you divert at least half of the funding you're giving to a disposal campaign to boosting the healthcare and research services."

3. "These empathy-ridden hooligans are letting their do-gooder impulses cloud their judgement," declares the slick @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, representative of ACME Construction, whilst fondling his golden tie bar. "As long as nobody breaks this stuff then it's all good, right? Asbestos has helped support the growing population of @@NAME@@ by allowing us to quickly build cheap, adequate housing, and we're going to need to keep that pace unless you want filthy beggars approaching you on every street corner. And think of how costly removing the stuff is going to be! Do you think the national coffers can actually fund it?"

The Issue
After tarot cards and a Ouija-board were found in the dormitory of three teenage girls who committed suicide, paranormal objects and occult rites have become the center of a heated debate on the rising popularity of New Age spirituality.

The Debate
1. "Obviously these girls killed themselves because they lost their spiritual war with the demons they thought fun to summon," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, notorious street preacher and self-taught exorcist. "Although, I don't blame them for being attracted to the occult, no, everyone needs spirituality. Our children just need the proper guidance, so they stay clear of the dangerous forms. The easiest way to ensure that is, of course, you banning everything that has any link with the New Age. That'll keep those demons out. Or is it in? Anyways, ban it!"

2. "Please don't listen to this traditional sorry-soul," pontificates Deborah Dihmonghali, self-proclaimed goddess and yoga-instructor, pausing briefly from transcending space and time. "Certainly there are some bad spirits out there, but you can't beat them by robbing us of all our spiritual weapons. Instead, you should subsidize their production and make half-yearly visits to a spiritual advisor compulsory for everyone. Only then will your citizens be pure and strong enough to repel the forces of evil and remain in the light."

3. "Possession? Are you serious?" queries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your unbearably uptight Minister of Conventional Solutions, while closing your curtains so as to not let the sunshine in. "These girls clearly had some issues, but not of the demonic kind. Depressed teenagers need to be dealt with through education and our health system, not through 'channeling', dirty bacchanals or waiting for Jupiter to align with Mars. Funky New Age spirituality only makes these things worse, especially for sensitive youngsters. To prevent this kind of thing in the future, we must increase mental health spending and set a minimum age on alternative religion."

The Issue
With the rising number of masked vigilantes dishing out two-fisted justice, the criminal underworld has responded in kind, with larger-than-life villains. After make-up wearing villain 'The Giggler' flooded a local high school with laughing gas, the public are asking you to take action.

The Debate
1. "Look, we're not living in a comic book. This is real life, not a work of fiction," reminds by-the-book police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leaning on one of the four walls of your office. "Let's put a ban on wearing face-concealing masks in public. Put villains and vigilantes into the cells, and let the police handle law and order. We can't allow @@NAME@@ to descend into mob rule from @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ taking the law into their own hands."

2. "Compulsory registration," suggests your surprisingly hip Justice Minister, without looking up from reading The Killing Bone, an unofficial Dogman tie-in comic. "We need all the help we can get to deal with these maniacs. Let the vigilantes do what they do, but require them to be registered and identified. Anyone who wears a mask and doesn't register can be assumed to be a villain, and must be met with zero tolerance."

3. "The police can't handle this." growls Dogman, the nation's first vigilante, who suddenly appears out of nowhere. "Step back, @@LEADER@@. I can deal with Giggler, because I understand how he thinks. Let the vigilantes handle the villains. This is our calling. This is our war." Then, as you turn your back to him for no good reason, he disappears with a puff of smoke.

4. "I agree with the spandex-wearing Dogman," chimes in the overly patriotic supersoldier turned superhero Captain @@NAME@@, dressed in a costume resembling the national flag. "You call us vigilantes - the people call us heroes. They trust us far more than the police. The police have become far too corrupt and powerful in this country. That's not what I signed up for. Why not disband the police and allow us heroes to take the villains and the criminals? Sure, some of us might go a bit overboard like that fellow in the in the iron suit, but we're always there to protect the little guy."

*5. "This is about ego," observes armchair psychologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while smoking a fine Maxtopian cigar. "It's also about superego and id... but mostly just egotism. Give these exhibitionists an outlet for their vanity. Televised arena bouts, celebrity status, and official merchandise are that outlet. They'll be promoting their careers rather than fighting on the streets, and as an added bonus, heroes and villains in the public eye are pretty easy for government to monitor."

Recently, there have been many reported incidents of cheaply repaired pieces of furniture falling apart and causing serious injuries, including bruises, cuts and even one case of fatal friction burn. Bandage-covered victims are demanding action!

The Debate
1. "Incompetent workers fixed my Hot'n'Heavy Magic Massage Chair the other day and do you know what happened?" yells @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ charred and covered with third-degree burns. "It thumped me so hard that I got scared, jumped from the chair, tripped on my cat, stumbled into the next room, tripped over a stack of TV Guides, and then fell into my fireplace! Plus the repair guy smelt funny! Clearly, they are responsible and must pay me compensation! Oh, and you should probably regulate the industry more or something, just make sure I get my check by Saturday..."

2. "That woman was lucky, compared to me," notes @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ from his wheelchair. "I lost both my legs and an eye, the result of someone forgetting a leg to my coffee table. A leg! How does anyone even do that? This industry is clearly extremely dangerous, no amount of regulation can solve that. Ban repairs and restoration altogether and people can instead buy newer and safer stuff. Ending is better than mending!"

3. "It ain't our fault if we don't do our job well, is it?" says blame-shifting cash-in-hand handyman @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ as he improvises a fix to your wobbly desk with duct tape and craft glue. "I mean, we get non-stop calls to fix this and that, so we haven't got any time for a quality job. The people who make chairs and the like should have done a better job. If you're going to force standards, then force them on the manufacturers, not us!"

4. "It's best if the government butts out and we 'let the free market run its course', as the cool kids say," observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of plastic-and-fibreboard furniture manufacturer QuickSell and Beyond. "Our products are a bit like a payday loan - you can get them easily and with no hassle, though you might need a new one next month. Just relax these silly safety standards! Then my factories can make and sell more chairs, more people gain employment, we make oodles of profit, and you get heaps of tax money. Everybody wins!"

After a government official was caught smuggling baskets into @@NAME@@, free trade advocates have called for an end to the embargo the @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ Ministry of Trade currently enforces against Marche Noire.

The Debate
1. "Now, I know we have some bad history with Marche Noire," argues the guilty civil servant, Kane 'The Wicker Man' Reed. "But it's just that - history! These guys excel in a coiled basketry that is just fabulous: are we really going to deprive ourselves of that just to hold onto an outdated grudge? Not to mention the terrible poverty we put them in with all these economic sanctions. End the embargo! It'll have a lot less people you need to throw in jail, right? Specifically, a certain government official and your number one fan?"

2. "Stop listening to that traitor and send him back to jail where he belongs!" demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a professionally xenophobic hardliner from the Foreign Office. "Our country has a long tradition of taking a stand against - uh - whatever it was those Marche Noirians did to us.

*4. "Maybe if the government gave more support to domestic industry, people wouldn't be going shopping for illegal imports?" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, State Factory Coordinator of National Basket Production. "If you were to help us out with some subsidies and other incentives, we could invest in hiring more staff, buying better raw materials, and engaging in industrial espio- ah, research and development. No one would look twice at that shoddy Marche Noirian workmanship when they saw our quality merchandise. We could even start exporting to the rest of @@REGION@@ and take over the market completely!"

[b][anchor=514]#514[/anchor]: Contract Killer [Singapore no2; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A legal battle has recently come to your attention, over a failed repayment of an overdue private debt and the validity of the underlying legal contract. The debtor owes ten thousand @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ and under the bond agreement signed, the lender is calling to take a pound of flesh in lieu of payment.

The Debate
1. "I deserve to obtain a pound of flesh from that bankrupt fellow over there, as we both willingly signed this bond in the presence of a lawyer," explains the lender, Mr. Boldkey, matter-of-factly. "The function of the law is to uphold justice, is it not? Exceptions to contracts will weaken confidence in the legal and financial system. Should I not be allowed to take what I am owed and to acquire it from say, his neck?"

2. "Please spare me, I have a family to look after!" wails the debtor from behind bars. He is promptly silenced by his lawyer, Mr. Balthazar, who in a suspiciously high pitched voice elaborates: "What my client is trying to communicate is that the purpose of the law is to protect the rights of the smallest minority that has ever existed, which is the individual. A judge - or the government - should be able to annul any contract that has an immoral basis. The quality of mercy should be applied now and serve as a benchmark for future cases."

3. "Give Boldkey that which is justly his, which is a pound of flesh, nothing more, nothing less!" says Ms. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, a bored looking lawyer. "But due to him not being a licensed agent of the law, he must then be charged with murder, or at least assault, depending on the extent of the injury inflicted. The letter of the law is served, and freedom as well."

[4]. "For this debtor's life, let justice itself stand accused!" interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, famed pedant and interfering busybody. "There is a law mandating measurements made metric, correct? Thus we must conclude, a 'pound of flesh' means nothing to the law, and the contract is void. Let precedent be set — without a metric of measure, a promise cannot bind!"

[b][anchor=515]#515[/anchor]: Little Green Men [Wagner the Great; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Overnight masked soldiers in unmarked green fatigues have appeared. Heavily armed and well-equipped, they have seized control of a southern portion of @@NAME@@. These "Little Green Men" seek independence from the @@TYPE@@, but they are known to be loyal to Blackacre, a nation that shares linguistic and cultural history with @@NAME@@. Your inner circle has convened an emergency meeting.

The Debate
1. Sweating heavily and panting after running to the meeting, Defense Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@ begins, "We do not have the resources or troops to fight, let alone recapture the South. It's chaos in the armed forces: I have officers defecting across the chain of command, and I'm not sure we can trust the remaining ones. We need to radically increase military spending and carefully monitor all unreliable elements within our ranks. With a reorganized military, we can at least prevent this crisis from getting completely out of hand."

2. Minister of Internal Affairs @@RANDOM_NAME@@ exclaims, "We have lost this territory, but we can still hold onto the south-east. My sources report that they too are planning an uprising. Let me send in paramilitaries and hired guns to pacify the unruly provinces, and we just might prevent a civil war. Sure, the paramilitaries are known for being heavy-handed extremists, but they're a hell of a lot cheaper than rebuilding our long-neglected military, especially since they bring their own guns."

3. "And you call yourselves @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the ambassador from Maxtopia, while smiling smugly. "@@NAME@@ and Maxtopia share a common enemy, so it's perfectly reasonable for us to grant you some generous loans and military experts to run your patriotic campaign. Maxtopia's security services could even help you remove spies from your officer corps. Admittedly we'll want all our money back later, but you can always slash a social program or ten to fund the interest payments."

4. "Some province wants to secede? Go right ahead," opines @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who doesn't seem to be taking this meeting seriously. "The South still depends on @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ electricity. Let's see how fun their lives are with blackouts day after day."

[b][anchor=516]#516[/anchor]: Sex Education Too Sexy, Say Parents [Gnejs; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Mandatory sex education has become the target of criticism after a new information video starring animated genitalia was shown to first-graders last week. Parenting groups from all over @@NAME@@ are in an uproar, claiming the video is excessively graphic and nothing but smut with a cute soundtrack.

The Debate
1. "You know, I'm as 'with it' as the rest of them," says unbearably un-cool mother of three @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, while adjusting her velvet scrunchie. "But excuse me if I feel a bit 'iffy' about my kids being shown hardcore stuff at school. I said it when you insisted on the mandatory sex education, and I'll say it again, genitals and naked bodies should have no place in our schools. Take it off the curriculum, for everybody!"

2. "I'd hardly call Mr. P and Lady V 'hardcore'," counters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a professional pragmatic who seemingly just materialized from the grey shades of bureaucracy. "The latest evaluation actually shows that the sex education program is doing wonders. However, people really are up at arms about this, aren't they? Let's suggest a compromise: mandatory sex education is here to stay, but we'll tone down the imagery and phraseology. I'm sure we'll be able to get the point across to the kids, if you know what I mean!"

3. "The real problem is that the videos aren't detailed and instructive enough!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prominent adult entertainer who also happens to be the Professor of Pedagogy at the University of @@CAPITAL@@. "Let me and my colleagues take over production, and I'll guarantee that the kids will really learn the ins and outs of it!"

[b][anchor=517]#517[/anchor]: Gallery In Need Of A Renaissance [Cachepanora; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
Having suffered from a continual decline in visitor numbers, the National Art Gallery of @@NAME@@ reached a new low yesterday, as just two visitors came through the turnstiles - one of whom was only there to fix the plumbing. Artists and aesthetes are demanding the government revamp the dated gallery to revitalise the nation's fading enthusiasm for the arts.

The Debate
1. "The reality is, no one cares about some portrait of a smirking woman from hundreds of years ago," asserts conceptual artist and millionaire @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Hirst, pouring formaldehyde over a chainsawed @@ANIMAL@@. "To get people excited about the arts, we need to display artworks that are relevant to this day and age - like mine."

2. "Our National Art Gallery is no place for your avant-garde junk!" responds caustic art critic Ryan Sewer, admiring a renaissance-era still life of a fruit bowl. "The National Art Gallery is underfunded. The government needs to spend more on preserving and promoting @@NAME@@'s creative heritage, or we risk becoming a nation of uncultured swine!"

3. "There's no need to be bitter over the differences in your aesthetic tastes," soothes sociologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Our galleries need diversity. We should fill them with works from around the world, from all styles, and from all eras. Then we can proudly consider ourselves a beacon for cultural tolerance."

4. "This just goes to show that the common man lacks the percipience to truly appreciate art," scoffs Lord Marmaduke, handing his monocle to his butler to polish. "If these plebs cannot appreciate the magnificent works the National Gallery have on display, they should be in the hands, and dare I say houses, of those with the taste - and perhaps money - to do so."

[b][anchor=518]#518[/anchor]: Face Lift [Zongzi; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
After a prominent artist was arrested for attempting to chisel the historic frontage of a particularly ugly courthouse into a sculpture, architectural firms and aspiring artists have petitioned you to renovate crumbling government buildings.

The Debate
1. "These old buildings are ugly and falling apart!" bemoans aspiring artist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while painting nude artwork of you as a form of protest. "If you let artists redesign your buildings, even amateurs, I guarantee the future of our nation will be more colorful, creative, and interesting! All we need is your permission and lots and lots of paint!"

[2]. "Why trust these amateurs when you could hire real professionals?" asks world renowned architect and CEO of Barry & Associates Architecture @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while making the final touches to a scale model display of a futuristic-looking @@CAPITAL@@. "As the head of the most experienced architectural firm in @@NAME@@, we are the best choice for renovating the government buildings of our nation. Not only will we have great designs, we'll only use the most modern materials available. Of course there is some considerable money involved, but think of your new fiberglass palace and futuristic office!" A beam suddenly falls down and destroys the model city, resulting in the architect letting out an anguished cry. [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3. "Bah! In communist East Lebatuck, buildings redesign you!" exclaims a musky foreign dignitary, seen wearing the dullest of gray clothes. "Look, your buildings aren't prettiest, but updating current aesthetics of building will keep loyal citizens focused on important thing, like harvest, parades and glorious leader. Private sector crooks or hack artist bring nothing but excessive monstrosities that lures people into decadence; only state itself should care for buildings. It be cheap and effective as well, all you need is plaster and portrait of yourself."

4. "Why fix our buildings at all?" queries the eccentric curator of the @@CAPITAL@@ National History Museum while punching a hole in your wall. "These old buildings are best enjoyed as part of history. Turn these moldy government offices and legislatures into a museum for all of @@NAME@@ to enjoy. We'll of course need some flashy advertising and authentic historical artifacts to get people interested. People would pay good money to see the original draft of the constitution that has the word 'suckers' in it. Just think of the patriotism and tourism money when people walk through those old, hallowed hallways. Well, maybe more curiosity than patriotism."

[b][anchor=519]#519[/anchor]: School's Out (Of Control) [Caracasus; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
After students at a school revolted and attempted to secede from @@NAME@@, leading to a three-day siege that was, thankfully, peacefully resolved, educators and parents from across the nation have called for something to be done about discipline in schools.

The Debate
1. "It's this modern let's-be-friends teaching style that is to blame," rants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a tired-looking retired headmistress, "We're all so concerned with mollycoddling these little hooligans that we've forgotten what education is supposed to do – instil obedience, discipline and respect for authority! Let's get in former army drill sergeants to teach the little sods. Sure, they might not have any formal teaching qualifications, but good teaching mostly just comes down to shouting louder than the children, in my experience."

2. "Well now, let's not blow this out of proportion," muses Mai Soixantehuit, a political science teacher, who until recently worked at the school in question. "Things may have gotten a little out of hand, but let's acknowledge that the students set up a functional working society in under three days. I say that they were exploring and learning under their own direction! Even the pipe bombs they made show great grasp of advanced chemistry. Schoolchildren should be given freedom to direct their own education and untap their personal potentials!"

3. "So we're either turning them into obedient robots or letting them run riot?" questions well-meaning parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We need to reach out to these poor, misguided kids and speak to them on their level! We need teachers who know how to talk to the youth of today in their own language. You should be doing more too, @@LEADER@@. Perhaps you should set up one of those MyFace pages, and would it kill you to wear a baseball cap once in a while?"

4. "I can see a lot of very unhappy teenagers in @@NAME@@," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prominent children's psychotherapist. "In my professional opinion this disruptive behaviour is little more than a symptom of an epidemic of youth psychological problems! Ensure that these children have access to the support they need - assign a psychologist to every school and ease up restrictions on prescribing mood-altering medications to children. Perhaps then we'll start to see calmer, happier children."
