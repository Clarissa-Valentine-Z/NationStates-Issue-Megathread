[b][anchor=960]#960[/anchor]: Nobody Does It Better? [Incremenia; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
After two @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ agents operating in Blackacre were compromised and forced to flee the country, a private military corporation known as the Webber Group has approached you about taking over the nation's intelligence-gathering activities.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, my operatives are perfect for this type of work," declares Webber Group CEO @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, flanked by two burly bodyguards. "Many of them have received military training prior to joining our company, so they're well versed in espionage, counter-intelligence, and assassina... um... proactive regime change strategies. If they're caught, you can deny any knowledge of them. Together, we can revitalize the foreign intelligence apparatus of @@NAME@@... for a small fee, of course."

2. "Are we really going to put the safety of our nation in the hands of this... thug?" questions secret agent James Bont while drinking a martini. "What the Webber Group fails to tell you is that many of their operatives were dishonorably discharged. They're violent, averse to authority, and unpredictable. Not to mention they're only loyal to a paycheck. @@LEADER@@, let me organize a training program for our less-experienced spies so they never get caught again."

[3]. "Frankly, I don't know why you need field agents at all," says your nephew while slaughtering pixelated enemies on his phone. "A skilled hacker can get any information you want from any system. Just hire a few tech-savvy people to spy on foreign nations or whatever."

[b][anchor=961]#961[/anchor]: No Two Ways About It [Singapore no2; ed:Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
A shocking exposé by a rogue official in the Department of Immigration revealed that dozens of elected representatives hold dual citizenship, with many of them hailing from your party. Angry citizens are now questioning the loyalty of these politicians and are demanding that they resign.

The Debate
1. "This is a disaster!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Minister of Internal Affairs, turning pale as he sees the growing number of protestors gathering outside your office. "We must force every single official with dual citizenship to step down immediately; after all, we can't be sure where their allegiances truly lie. Our integrity as a party will not survive this incident unscathed unless we send a strong message that dishonesty cannot be tolerated."

2. "You call that sending a message?" raves xenophobe @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the notorious author of [i]@@LEADER@@ is a Secret Bigtopian Spy: The Truth Revealed[/i]. "Those filthy aliens managed to infiltrate the highest levels of our government, and are probably going to enforce radical Violetist law the instant they take over. The only way to save our nation is to strip these traitors of their @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizenship and send them back to whichever hellhole countries they're working for. If you refuse... then I'll finally have concrete proof that you really are a Bigtopian in disguise!"

3. "Can we just talk it out?" pleads the Secretary of the Treasury, who was outed as having Brancalandian citizenship. "There are perfectly legitimate reasons for politicians to have connections to more than one nation. For example, those of us who immigrated here should be able to visit relatives in the old homeland without having to fill out a mountain of paperwork. Plus, citizens of Brancaland get a free barrel of maple syrup every year! If you outlaw this, I'm holding you personally responsible for the sugar withdrawal."

4. "There's no need to change anything," whispers your Minister of Spying, Subterfuge, and Baked Goods while showing you his latest exploding pie prototype. "You should let me handle this little problem. It appears that a pesky official within the Department of Immigration snitched on your friends. We'll fabricate a charge to implicate that ingrate and squeeze a confession out of her to reduce her credibility. She'll then be exiled somewhere while we modify the citizenship records of the implicated officials. Does that sound good to you? If so, I think we have time to demonstrate the weaponized muffins."

The Issue
Following a sale on gluten-free goods at the N'Ever Fresh chain of supermarkets, the shelves were stripped of all but a packet of gluten-free gravy granules and a slightly-stale baguette. The hungry coeliacs of @@NAME@@ claim these items were not bought by fellow gluten-intolerants, but by fad dieters.

3. "If this @@MAN_1@@ had a grain of sense, @@HE_1 @@'d realise that these half-baked ideas would cripple the national budget," asserts your Minister of Finance, hiding her gluten-free sliced white bread in a drawer. "If they can't find or afford gluten-free breads and pastas, there are plenty of naturally gluten-free foods such as rice and potatoes that they can buy instead. Simply issue a few leaflets that doctors can hand out to their patients about cheap foods that are naturally gluten-free."

4. "I think that's a really crummy idea!" complains @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, author of the food sceptic's handbook [i]Inconsiderate 'Intolerances' and Awkward 'Allergies': Why Won't the Whiners Simply Swallow Their Fare?[/i]. "We shouldn't pander to these people. These so-called special diets have gone past a joke, what with restaurants offering 'gluten-free' and 'dairy-free' and 'nut-free' choices. And why? For some mewling, puking babies that use made-up diseases to get special attention, and for the Big Pharma companies that pay researchers to back up their claims and boost their own profits.

[b][anchor=963]#963[/anchor]: The @@LEADER@@ Meme [Siarki; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
During a recent speech, a particularly embarrassing pose you struck became rather popular on the internet. The pose has spawned numerous parodies and humorous political commentary. A few of your bewildered advisers have asked you to address the so-called '@@LEADER@@ Meme'.

The Debate
1. "These images are ruining your image!" points out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an adviser from your Department of Redundancy Department. "They make you look like an incompetent and imprudent fool, especially in rival enemy nations. I heard Maxtopia is putting up posters and placards of these so-called 'memes' in their subways! What may seem like innocent, benign images could evolve into political action that will inspire protests and riots! You have to ban insulting images of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ politicians."

2. "You can't take away that freedom!" pleas @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an adviser from your Department of Office Vending Machine Contents. "I mean, look at this one! It's so funny! And this one here, they made it look like you're holding a cat! I say keep them coming. People like a leader with a sense of humor. If you punish those who use free speech to peacefully protest, the backlash you'll receive will be far worse than these pictures."

3. "I agree. In fact, I think we can make an opportunity of this," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an adviser from your Department of Memetic Imagery, which you don't recall having. "Some of these may be a bit insulting, sure, but some of them are lighthearted, or even beneficial. The one with you and a cat? It makes you look gentle and appreciative of animals. To better your image, we should masquerade as everyday citizens, and create and spread favorable memes ourselves."

4. "Sometimes we make mistakes," admits @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an adviser from your Department of Political Choreography. "That's why pencils have erasers. Like other fads, this '@@LEADER@@ Meme' will die out; you just have to give it time. Meanwhile, you could benefit from practicing your stage performance for future speeches and appearances. Y'know, to prevent this from happening again."

The Issue
Sporting events have always drawn big crowds of passionate fans, but those same crowds can bring a temporary surge in crime. While extra policing can be assigned, questions have been raised over who should pay for this.

The Debate
1. "These are big-profit events for the corporations that run them, but they generate considerable externalities which must be paid for by taxpayers," explains Police Assistant Accountancy Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, seeming excited to be at the centre of attention for once. "Let the profiteers pick up the extra cost, as guesstimated... I mean, carefully calculated by my department."

2. "Excuse me? Since when have private companies been liable to fund public services?" retorts CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@, showing you an empty wallet to emphasise her point, though her gesture is diminished in impact by it being a ridiculously expensive crocodile-skin, diamond-studded designer piece. "If you cut into profits, you discourage free market enterprise, and if you do that, there'll be less sporting entertainment. And you know what happens when a populace doesn't get its sports? That's right - they start thinking about politics, and criticising their social betters. Do you really want that to happen?"

3. "Oi oi, there's no need for all this bovver," grins die-hard fan Four Fingers @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, hiding a bloodied length of scaffolding pole behind his back. "So we like to let off a bit of steam before and after the match, and have a bit of a scrap. It's all good fun, and nobody who don't wants to be there has to be there if they don't wants to be, right? So why not give the rozzers the day off, and let us sort ourselves out?"

[4]. "Sports fans are a nasty bunch, but you've got to admire their fighting spirit," comments Colonel @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ with a wry smile. "Come wartime, we could use men of their calibre. Shut down all professional sports, and conscript the lot of them. All that pent-up energy can instead be directed to the national good." [[color=blue]Must not have conscription[/color]]

The Issue
While attending an art exhibition of pieces lent by Dàguó, your advisor accidentally knocked over an ancient Dàmíng dynasty vase, shattering it.

The Debate
1. "Harken, all! That vase was an irreplaceable treasure of great national importance, and to lose it is a severe blow to our cultural heritage and history," proclaims the High Eunuch of the Dàguó Imperial Court, reading intently from a scroll. "Our virtuous and benevolent ruler shall extract a small sum of eight million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in restitution. Denial of the Celestial Emperor's wishes shall be repaid with severe sanctions for @@NAME@@."

*2. "I can't... I mean, the treasury can't afford that!" wails @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the advisor in question, knocking over a priceless Moltovean ornament while entering your office. "Whoops! Did you forget that compensation of any sort is outlawed in @@NAME@@? There's a good reason for that — if we had it, citizens and businesses alike would be at the mercy of greedy claimants, and nobody would dare sell anything due to the risk of having to pay damages. Instead of me paying for the vase, I suggest that we issue a state apology to Dàguó and simply hope for the best." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

There's a good reason for that — if we had it, everyone would be at the mercy of greedy claimants, and nobody could engage in anything with anyone without the risk of having to pay damages. Instead of me paying for the vase, I suggest that we issue a state apology to Dàguó and simply hope for the best." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "I have a better idea, one that won't cost us a single @@CURRENCY@@!" claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the State Treasurer. "We could just decide who is right with a duel! The claimant and the person who supposedly caused the damage will fight to the death, and whoever survives gets the other person's stuff as spoils and remuneration for wasting their time! In our scenario here, we'll either get rid of that incompetent advisor or that snobbish emperor. A win-win for us all, except for the one that dies."

The Issue
Duke @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ of Lower @@CAPITAL@@-Upon-Tyne caused quite a stir this weekend after he had a traveling minstrel group chased out of town. While some fellow peers have accused him of being humorless, the Duke countered that the troupe was subverting his authority with their seditious acts.

The Debate
1. "That troupe's impromptu performance was scandalous," spits the irate Duke. "Caricaturing me as the villain in their little Scheherazade knock-off? The nerve of those performers! Do you think I let these thespian transients wander around my domain just to watch them humiliate our way of life? I've no obligation to provide charity to a bunch of disrespectful wretches. @@LEADER@@, forbid these flimflam singsongs and outlaw this sort of vagrancy before some smart-alecky troupe comes knocking at your door. We'll all be safer for it in the long-run."

2. "Have you no sense of perspective?" exclaims beaten and ragged minstrel @@RANDOM_NAME@@, haphazardly waving a flute around. "Satire is essential for introspection! Don't be such a stuffed shirt. If you really want performers off the street, let us musicians be officially patronized by the government. Just assign a musical group to each noble family, and our melodious tunes will surely lighten the load on their noble shoulders."

3. "Isn't that what you employ oddfellows like me for?" grumbles grizzled jester Krusty @@ANIMAL@@, covered profusely in tomato stains. "Me and my mates, your musicians, clowns, acrobats, dancing poodle performers, you name it - we're smart enough not to bite the hand that feeds us. Construct a grand theatre for all to see and adore us, and we'll sing your praises loud enough to drown out the voices of petty satire."

The Issue
A dubious study in a dubious scientific magazine recently asserted that pizza is healthy, preventing heart disease, curing cancer and treating low libido. The scientific community rapidly discredited the study, but not before newspaper headlines had many @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ believing it.

The Debate
1. "This is a cheese-topped catastrophe! A doughy disaster!" moans paediatrician Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has spent all morning trying to convince mums not to put their kids on a pizza-only diet. "Science can't move forward if its legitimacy is being undermined by bad studies! This [i]Eckie-Cola Scientific Review[/i] is a sorry excuse for a publication, taking payment to publish any old trash, and masquerading as a serious journal! You must pass laws demanding stringency of peer review and reference-checking in academia."

2. "You can't stop bad science," complains sociologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What you can do, however, is expect the media to check if studies are legitimate. Just fine news networks each time they broadcast misleading information or fail to check their scientific sources, and hold them legally accountable for the consequences of misinformation."

3. "Mamma mia, I tell you this is the truth!" exclaims Professor Giuseppe De Luigi, of the Independent Pizza Research Institute. "The ivory tower of academia has been saying for years that pizza was making the bambinos obese, but here is the evidence! It has all the fresh and organic ingredients, like tomatoes and even pineapples, and they count as a vegetable, sì? You should be telling everyone to be eating my cousin Benito's delicious pizzas!"

The Issue
Last night, in the finals of popular reality TV contest [i]@@REGION@@vision[/i], the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ representative lost, despite giving what almost all critics in @@NAME@@ have declared to be a superior performance. The enraged masses have inexplicably decided that the best course of action is to storm your office to voice their complaints.

The Debate
1. "It was rigged!" chants real housewife of @@CAPITAL@@, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ Karsprintian, who is so angered that she is speaking at a pace you're having trouble keeping up with. "Half the judges looked to be Maxtopian to me, and you know what [i]those people[/i] think of us and our culture. The contest must be rerun, this time with more unbiased judges from @@NAME@@. If the rest of @@REGION@@ doesn't agree, threaten trade sanctions, heck, maybe even outright war. Our national pride depends on this!"

2. "Clearly, the rest of @@REGION@@ are just uncultured idiots!" crescendoes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was recently voted the country's most-eligible bachelor. "If they can't appreciate us, who needs them? The government should sponsor its own patriotic song contest! Call it @@DEMONYM@@ Idol, only let native-born @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ compete, and let @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ vote for a winner. A song for the people, by the people, to the people, from the people. Or something."

3. "For sure, everyone knows that [i]@@REGION@@vision[/i] always has every nation giving top marks to their favourite historic allies," intones reality show survivor Geoff Probes. "Maybe instead you should be asking why other nations don't feel inclined to treat @@NAME@@ that way. Maybe you should be investing more in diplomacy, in mutual-backscratching, in favorable trade deals traded for agreeable song contest votes. This is how the world works, and we should be learning to play nice with our neighbors."

4. "If you ask me, these low-brow shows are making your average @@DEMONYM@@ no smarter than a 5th-grader," croons your apprentice, after finally clearing the rabble from your office. "If only more shows on TV were serious, like [i]60 Clock-ticks[/i], or informative, like [i]Will Zeke the Science Geek[/i], then television could actually help create a smarter, more refined populace."

The Issue
Healthcare in @@NAME@@ is widely acknowledged as among the best in the world. Hospitals have seen a steady influx of patients from abroad. However, with so much medical tourism, there are claims that this is making it difficult for native @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to access their own healthcare system.

The Debate
1. "This is outrageous!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is camped outside @@CAPITAL@@ Public Hospital under a makeshift tent. "I came in for a routine checkup over a week ago, and no one has seen me yet. There are too many foreigners taking up our doctors' valuable time! We have to ban access to healthcare services for all non-citizens. It's not our fault their healthcare systems aren't as good as ours. Realistically, this is the only way to guarantee the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ people are getting the healthcare we deserve."

2. "Whoa there!" interrupts Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the nation's leading posterior surgeon. "We have definitely been swamped with foreign patients, but turning them down altogether seems a bit harsh. How about we only accept non-citizens as patients if they have contracted a life-threatening illness or injury while traveling through @@NAME@@? That way, we won't turn away the needy in our own country, but we also won't be besieged with patients from other nations."

3. "Now hold on!" shouts your Secretary of Health as @@HE@@ stumbles in with excitement. "This presents a great opportunity! There's no question that our healthcare resources are some of the best in the world. Why shouldn't we use this as leverage to cash in on foreign desperation? We could make a lot of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ by charging steep fees to non-citizens! This way, only those willing to pay can get in, and the extra money will ensure that our hospitals are well-equipped for the influx. It's a win-win solution! Well, except for the poor foreigners, but you can't save them all."

4. "Where is your compassion?" chides foreign celebrity @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has had extensive cosmetic surgery performed at @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ hospitals. "You can't simply shun your foreign patients! Some of these people don't even have basic medical care in their home countries. You have to grow a heart and understand that people only come to you because you're the best. I say that you should welcome all visitors to your hospitals, regardless of national status, and treat them as your own. If you have to send more tax funds to healthcare to accomplish this, it's only right that you do so!"

5. "Call me Captain Obvious," says airline pilot Captain Tom Obvious, "but doesn't a near-miss air collision suggest we need to be spending more on air safety? We need more air traffic controllers working shorter shifts, and fewer night-time and bad weather flights. What? Someone has to be sensible here." His co-pilot, Jane Sensible, nods in agreement.

6. "This is [i]Emergence[/i] at work," reverently whispers wild-eyed lepidopterometeorologist Professor Frank Benjamin.

1. "Those brutes are hurting my image," complains the original composer of the piece, while shoving their baton at a racist poster featuring some of the song's lyrics. "I wrote the song to represent all of the good things about the nation's people like... like... well, you know. We need to take back my anthem!

"I know that he's a monster who has killed and will kill again, but are we really going to stoop down to his level? Those kids are innocent of any of the atrocities their father has committed. We must hold our fire and try to find another way that doesn't have such a high risk of collateral damage."

2. From the corner of the monitor, you can see a terrorist soldier spot the drone and begin to assemble a surface-to-air-missile launch platform. The operator turns around in his chair with a look of urgency. "Boss, we're just about to lose the drone. It's now or never! Authorise me to take the shot. If we let him go, it might take years for us to find him again - and who knows how many more children he might kill in the meantime? The inevitable loss of the little ones will be regrettable, but we need to take him out now!"

[b][anchor=974]#974[/anchor]: Siren Song [Candensia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
During a severe weather outbreak yesterday, weather sirens raised the alarm about the incoming danger. However, that didn't seem to concern residents, who had grown all too used to constant tests and malfunctions associated with the aging system. Following dozens of fatalities, a discussion has arisen regarding the best method to warn the public about approaching weather threats.

The Debate
1. "I'm tired of weathering weather sirens!" shouts storm survivor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, still wearing @@HIS@@ soggy raincoat. "I'm in my house, glued to my phone, when I thought I heard a train. Turns out, it was no train; it was a twister coming straight at me! Sure, I heard the sirens, but they go off all the time! Instead of listening out for old sirens, we should get official weather alerts through our phones. I mean, people definitely won't ignore their cell phones!"

2. "Well, not everyone has a cell phone, and what if its battery dies in the middle of a storm, what then?" questions @@NAME@@ Emergency Management spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The biggest advantage to sirens is that we can assure that they will always work... as long as they aren't old, malfunctioning, or whatever. It should be clear that a refit of the siren system is on the radar. All we need to do is update them to be more... attention-grabbing. I'm sure citizens won't ignore weather sirens if we replace the wail with, say, a blood-curdling scream!""

3. "Why is it the government's responsibility to warn us of incoming life or death situations?" rants well-known libertarian political speaker @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, failing to intervene as his infant picks up a nearby nail gun. "It's the responsibility of the individual to ensure their own safety. We shouldn't be wasting @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ maintaining a faulty, hardly-used system. I say we let the old siren system die, save ourselves some money, and call it a day. If the average @@DEMONYM@@ doesn't have enough common sense to take caution when the weather gets bad, then I forecast that @@NAME@@ has a far bigger problem."

[b][anchor=975]#975[/anchor]: Paparazzi Parents [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A teenager recently made headlines when he filed a lawsuit against his parents who had shared his photos on MyFace without his consent, prompting a discussion on whether parents have the right to post their kids' pictures without their permission.

The Debate
1. "This is a shameless infringement of my client's privacy!" thunders @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the lawyer of the teenage plaintiff, while @@HE@@ spreads an array of @@HIS@@ client's intimate childhood pictures on your desk. "You see, these irresponsible parents have unscrupulously documented the most private moments of my client, taking shots of him while he sat upon a potty chair, or ran around in his diapers, and then they shared them on their MyFace account! I don't even need to mention the weirdos who may now have access to these sensitive pictures. Distributing any pictures of minors online, or offline, should be a criminal offense!"

2. "Frankly, I don't understand why this is even an issue," grumbles @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the mother of the disgruntled teenager, as she snuggles up to you and pouts her lips to #TakeASelfieWithTheLeader. "I mean, what is more natural for a mother than to take the pictures of her pretty little pumpkin and his adorable chubby bum, and to share them with her friends? We can't take the tantrums of a pubescent kid high on hormones seriously, can we? As legal guardians, parents should be allowed to dispose of their kids' pictures as they like."

*3. "Ahem, I say we don't have to think in binary terms," chips in Marcus Sugarmountain, the founder of MyFace, while he nervously scans your room with wide, bulging eyes. "I would first like to assure you that our app is very safe. Nobody would ever need to fear a data leak or any breach of security on our part. But if half-naked photos of kids are a problem, in order to safeguard our profile, we could simply program a bot to sift through all photos in our database and to tag and remove the ones in which too much flesh is exposed. What do you think?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "Ahem, I say we don't have to think in binary terms," chips in @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the administrator of the government's largest social media network, while @@HE@@ nervously scans your room with wide, bulging eyes. "I would first like to assure you that our app is very safe. Nobody would ever need to fear a data leak or any breach of security on our part. But if half-naked photos of kids are a problem, in order to safeguard our profile, we could simply program a bot to sift through all photos in our database and to tag and remove the ones in which too much flesh is exposed.

[b][anchor=976]#976[/anchor]: Demonic Possession Getting You Down? [Baggieland; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Reports that more and more @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are seeking exorcisms for being possessed by evil spirits are fuelling rumours of an impending apocalypse.

The Debate
1. "What absolute hokum!" asserts famous sceptic @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, shaking her head in disbelief. "All these people who claim to be possessed are attention-seeking drama-queens. Demonic possession is not real. We need a public information campaign which states that demons are imaginary, the apocalypse isn't coming and everyone should just calm down."

2. "DEMON! I'm going to need some help here," screams exorcist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, as he begins sprinkling her with holy water. As his baffled assistants take over pinning her down, he turns to you. "My congregation alone has thousands of citizens and they all claim to be possessed. I can't administer exorcisms to all these people all by myself. The government needs to set-up a massive recruitment drive for all the remaining non-possessed citizens to become exorcists and fast-track their exorcism training."

3. "The hour of damnation is at hand!" shouts Monk de Wally de Honk, a doomsday 'prophet' who frequently changes his forecast of the date of the apocalypse. "I have studied the words of holy books and the stars, and @@NAME@@ doesn't have much time! I implore you to move those remaining souls who aren't possessed to safe, remote, and unaffected areas of the nation. The purity and isolation of the land shall keep us safe!"

4. Finally, a man dressed in a dark suit and holding a pile of contracts seems to appear out of nowhere. "I am from the law firm Horace, Edward, Logan and Lee. My client has instructed me to inform you that there is only one way to save the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ people from this calamity. Tell all of them to sign these contracts, then my client shall transport them all to a place far away from the imminent catastrophe. There's nothing to be suspicious about, my client is a reasonable fellow."

The Issue
In the midst of a religious ritual deep in the jungles of @@NAME@@, members of the Ngwane tribe were blindsided by a sudden police raid. Citing laws against body modification, the police dumped out barrels of tattoo ink, confiscated store huts full of piercings, and arrested the Ngwane.

The Debate
1. "This is a sad chapter in our history," observes tribal Chief U'ana Nosren'g, stroking the chicken bone he wears as a chin-piercing. "The ancestor spirits weep at the sacrilege our people have had to endure. The boys who were being inducted into manhood can now never be considered to be true men. This is religious discrimination and oppression of my people. Please let my people go and allow body piercing and modification once more."

2. "My team was just following the law," states SWAT captain @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who oversaw the raid. "They get no sympathy from me. Anyone who lives within our jurisdiction is subject to our rules and regulations. The laws against body modification help promote public order and traditional values. Let this go, and you're re-opening the door to inked gang-members and pierced punks."

3. "I doubt that our primitive friends were intentionally ignorant," coos @@RANDOM_NAME@@, board member with the religious recreation camp 'Fun with Faith'. "Their determination to pursue these modifications stemmed from their backwards beliefs and simple-minded tribal ways. If you'd just sponsor our outreach program, we could perhaps guide the Ngwane down the path towards a more advanced faith. Change starts with the children, you know."

4. "Just leave these people alone!" wails inner-city guru @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has crafted 'tribal solidarity bracelets' out of beads and tatty string. "If the police hadn't interfered in the first place, that village would still be celebrating their rituals, none the wiser! Not only should we let them live as they see fit, we need to return all these tribes to their original isolated states. Drop all contact immediately, and then retreat from ever laying a finger on them again."

[b][anchor=978]#978[/anchor]: Alone in the Dark [Zhokinland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Convicted criminal and former journalist @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ was recently released from @@CAPITAL@@ Central Penitentiary. @@HE_1@@ is now revealing to the media the horrors that @@HE_1@@ suffered behind bars, specifically the "torture and terror" of solitary confinement.

The Debate
1. "Solitary confinement is demoralizing, dehumanizing, and wrong," explains @@LASTNAME_1@@, letting wind and rain soak your desk paperwork as @@HE_1@@ throws your office window wide open. "Research has proven that it causes immense levels of lasting psychological trauma! It's also much more expensive for the prison system, and is little more than state-sanctioned torture. The inhumanity of prisoners left alone in the dark must end! Ban it now!"

2. "We only put the troublemaker in the sin bin because @@HE_1@@ kept causing problems," remarks Warden @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shoving the former convict into your broom cupboard and wedging the door shut with a chair. "While solitary is used punitively to maintain prison discipline, it can also be deployed to protect the safety of the confined inmate or of other prisoners. Besides, all these ding-dongs gave up their rights the moment they turned to crime."

3. "All these prisoners are just sitting around soaking up government money; why not make them give back to society?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, local mad scientist. "We'll take a kidney, or maybe a cornea or two, and send them on their way. It'll be fantastic! They don't have to sit around all day wasting our money, and they get to go on doing whatever it is that they do. Think of all the lives we can save!"

[b][anchor=979]#979[/anchor]: A Patronising Statement [Caracasus; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The unveiling of a painting of Duke @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_2@@'s daughter resulted in quite a commotion at court yesterday evening, when palace guards had to break up a scuffle between the Duke and the artist commissioned to paint the piece. Now that the persons in question have had a night to simmer down in the castle dungeon, you have requested their presence to better explain themselves.

The Debate
1. "I have patronised this worthless wastrel for six years! Six years and @@HE_1@@ produces this!" bellows the Duke, brandishing his fists at the cowering artist. "This was to be a present for my dearest daughter, and this sot - deep in her cups I'd wager - vomits up this abomination that resembles nothing other than Beelzebub's rear end! I demand repayment of @@HIS_1@@ patronage and if not, I must be allowed the right to beat it out of the wretch's hide!"

2. "I... I am sorry but I cannot return the Duke's coin," tremors @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ de @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, wringing together @@HIS@@ hands, which are stained with what is presumably red paint. "It has been spent in the execution of the painting, on the finest pigments from Dàguó and the finest wench- er- models for the piece. Besides, the good duke scarcely helped. Throughout the painting he was always questioning me when it would be complete, or if I should not include this or that within it. I am an artist! I must follow my muse! You cannot hold us artists at fault if the viewer doesn't find the painting to their liking, can you?"

[3]. "You say art, we say impious images," intones hierophant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, nearly concussing a guard with a swing of @@HIS@@ thurible. "This trend for painted depictions of Divine Creation is sheer blasphemy, and worse still are the nobles who fritter their wealth away on worldly images instead of entrusting their coin to the Holy Temple! Condemn these unholy works to the flame, lest we encourage the very worst acts of debauchery and fornication within our very nation!" [[color=purple]Must lean towards being religious[/color]]

[4]. "Ugh! This is, like, so twelfth century!" scowls Lady @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ @@LASTNAME_2@@, watching her father rage with an expression of absolute embarrassment and disdain. "I've taken, like, fifteen selfies of myself today and uploaded them to MyFace already and you haven't liked one of them! I've totally got better things to do than sit still for another portrait. You should tell these painters that they have to take photos from now on. I've always thought you were way cooler than my dad, @@LEADER@@." [[color=purple]internet is legal[/color]]
