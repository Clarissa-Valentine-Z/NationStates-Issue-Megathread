[b][anchor=1100]#1100[/anchor]: Raiders of the Lost Archive [Helaw; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
News has reached your ears that a long-lost governmental document - known only as the [i]Directiones Ad Balneo[/i] - has been finally discovered by a group of archivists that had adventured deep into the immense @@CAPITAL@@ Archives. Not wanting to risk their lives with such spelunking again, the archivists have petitioned the government to properly organise all of its innumerable files and records.

The Debate
1. "We almost lost @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ to the jaws of a great book avalanche!" raves @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the archivist who led the expedition. "This whole thing was expensive, dangerous, and exhausting. You have to get your lackeys to go through every document we have and organise them, so that we don't have to endure something like this again. Your team has to be ruthless and destroy any document that's obsolete or redundant!" @@HE@@ grabs you tightly, and pulls you towards @@HIM@@. "Please, don't send me back into that maw of legality and horror."

2. "A disorganised library is one with character," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, picking up a discarded copy of a constitutional document. "These assortments of books act as reminders of our nation's past, and they can act as a blueprint for the future. We have placed these records here over the years to preserve them and use them as bricks in an architectural masterpiece of colossal scale; it would be unwise to recklessly catalogue them in the pursuit of some notion of organisation. Besides, our government is running just fine and we have more important things to worry about."

[3]. "It's time to move into the digital age!" decries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, brandishing a portable hard drive. "We can digitise every document we have, and release all of them for every person in @@NAME@@ to see! The wondrous power of both man and machine can help us learn from our past texts, and build something new and beautiful." [[color=blue]Computers are legal[/color]]

4. "What's to stop a thief from waltzing into those archives and stealing top-secret documents?" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prominent member of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ military. "It is clear that all of this bureaucratic faffing about is stifling @@NAME@@'s actions. I propose that we transfer all confidential files to the military's safe and secure hands, and rid ourselves of the other... disposable pieces of paperwork. After all, an efficient nation is one that does not look back into the pitiful past."

The Issue
A study in the journal [i]Periodical for Learning About the Sociological Misadventures of Audiovisuals[/i] has revealed that young adults who watch reality television are more likely to experience negative social interaction and emotional effects than their peers.

The Debate
1. "Reality television gives the impression that what is appearing on television is, in fact, realistic," complains lead researcher Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hiding @@HIS@@ [i]Television is for Squares[/i] badge beneath @@HIS@@ labcoat. "In fact, it's scripted and heavily edited fiction. Constant arguments, excessive expressed emotion, unrealistic body expectations, instant gratification: these lead to youths acting out in unacceptable ways and to a general negative inertia in society. All these shows should carry disclaimers to explain how reality is being misrepresented, and all schoolchildren must be taught about the distortions in these shows."

2. "Like my sister Chrissie says: don't be haters just 'cuz you ain't us," natters Christina Cholmondeley, of popular reality show [i]Crashing Out with the Cholmondeleys[/i], as she flicks her hair. "Reality TV is, like... what's the word? Not Alsatian... aspirational. We aspire kids to be better than they are. If they're fat and stupid, we make them want to be pretty and clever, like us. By acting like us, they can hope to be like us. Then they'll have their own brand of perfume, like [i]Chrissie C's Pong of Class[/i], which is on sale now, babe. Rather than oppress us, you should show your fans how awesome you are by being on our show... like, lots. @@NAME@@ needs our brand of style way more than political speeches."

3. "Objection!" shouts arbiter 'Judge Woody', who earns one million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ per show, as he bangs his gavel on your desk. "@@LEADER@@, that Cholmondeley moron is selling you manure and telling you it's chocolate. Does she think you're an idiot? Brain-dead shows like hers are the reason why young @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ have no motivation to get a real job. They see over-glossed and glossed-over lives, and think it all comes easy. Young people would be more focused if reality shows only showed serious professionals doing real jobs, and not lies about fame and fortune."

4. "The problem is the negativity," chimes preternaturally perky Baby Bebe Baker-Bell, who found fame as a child singing on [i]@@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ Have Talent (Honest!)[/i]. "Backstage, wranglers stir up spiteful competition between contestants. They goaded me into calling someone a 'meanie bo beanie'! I still wake up sweating. But maybe a better class of reality TV could instead nurture a pleasant society by encouraging participants to only be nice to each other, and by editing out the sad parts of life. Wouldn't it be lovely if everybody got along better?"

5. "We must escape from dreary reality," says @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, your nephew and a recent graduate of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Academy of Dramatic Art, as he strikes a stereotypically heroic stance. "By forcibly reallocating all reality TV slots and funding, we could tell intelligent stories and pay good wages to highly skilled actors who have a classic face suited to play either the dashing lead or the brooding baddie. Noir mysteries, sultry sagas in country houses, earthy dramedies, pulsating thrillers, period pieces of pride, prejudice and penury; with funding, we could usher in a golden age of quality @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ drama."

The Issue
Inmate @@RANDOM_NAME@@ died in prison yesterday after years of battling cancer. The death of the prisoner has prompted humanitarian groups to call for a compassionate release policy for terminally ill and elderly inmates.

The Debate
1. "A portion of our imprisoned population lives in holding cells when they really belong in hospice care," says well-known philanthropist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wringing @@HIS@@ hands over the images of bedraggled inmates in grimy cells that @@HE@@ has spread across your desk. "A compassionate release system will allow these inmates to live out their days free from the encumbrance of incarceration. Yes, they might be criminals, but anyone who considers the elderly, debilitated, or dying a danger to society should consider a wellness check themselves."

2. "We can't just release inmates every time they get a hangnail," wheezes sickly-looking former sheriff @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ slaps a truncheon in @@HIS@@ palm. "Sure, compassionate release might cut costs, but at what cost to the community? Tell me, what's stopping these crazies from going on crime sprees following their release? Arthritis? Keep these people in prison, @@LEADER@@! Convicts should serve the entirety of their sentences, even if it means they get paroled out the back door."

3. "I'm all in favor of keeping criminals off the streets, but prison infirmaries aren't adequately equipped or staffed to handle inmates who often end up sick, stabbed, or sometimes both," declares prison nurse @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ shows you over a dozen shanks @@HE@@ has collected from @@HIS@@ patients. "I mean, the sheer number of items one can substitute for a surgical suture is impressive and all, but @@NATION@@ should really invest in prison medical facilities and personnel capable of supporting all who dwell within the walls."

[b][anchor=1103]#1103[/anchor]: Dàguó Takeaway [Australian rePublic; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
Dàguó companies with ties to their autocratic government own a wide range of power stations, water processing plants and railway lines in @@NAME@@. One such company has expressed interest in buying yet another asset: the Port of @@CAPITAL@@.

The Debate
1. "You can't be serious!" gestures @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Dàguó defector who owns a lucrative business in @@NAME@@, yet is too afraid of @@HIS@@ birth country to list @@HIS@@ company on the stock market. "They poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto us! Well not yet, but are we just gonna sit around and wait until they do? Dàguó's not exactly benign on the geopolitical stage. By allowing them to invest in our commodities, we're potentially jeopardising our national security. We need to block the sale of any asset to Dàguó."

2. "This is very counter-productive!" declares Dàguó's ambassador @@RANDOM_NAME@@, accidentally allowing you a glimpse of @@HIS@@ list of spies posing as construction workers. "Companies from Dàguó have brought in plenty of capital to @@NAME@@, and have built and invested in a great deal of infrastructure. Dàguó projects are ultimately good for @@NAME@@ and it's offensive to suggest that our companies are problematic simply because they are owned by the Dàguó government."

3. "If we didn't sell off our important infrastructure in the first place, we wouldn't have this problem, would we?" states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ uses a stack of Communist Manifestos as an impromptu soapbox. "Privatising our assets is a terrible practice; the supposed benefits have not been delivered to the people. As such, we should nationalise all corporate property right away."

[b][anchor=1104]#1104[/anchor]: Balancing the Books [Braskia; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
After selling just 187 copies, [i]How to Repair Your Cat for Dummies[/i] was shockingly still the national #1 best-seller this year. In response, a small group of effete, sweater-vest-clad bookworms have used copies of [i]War and Peas[/i] to barricade themselves in your office.

The Debate
1. "That's truly shameful," sighs local librarian @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pulling a copy of [i]The Visible Hand[/i] from within the deep pockets of @@HIS@@ overcoat. "The solution is subsidizing books. The reduced prices will encourage @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to buy a good ol' book again. Infinite knowledge is waiting just behind those pages, @@LEADER@@. Folks just need a little nudge."

2. "It's not their choice anymore," declares your Minister of Education, while reluctantly putting down a copy of [i]The Complete Works of Shakespeare[/i]. "People don't realize what they are losing by not reading. If @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ stopped watching 'The Brash and the Backstabbing' and actually read something, we'd have a more interesting, enlightened, and productive populace. For everyone's sake, make it mandatory to read a book every month."

3. "What about us?" asks the best-selling author Bax Marry, already signing a copy of his feline mending manual without you asking. "We are the ones that need help. It took five years of hard work and painful scratches to figure out how to properly cauterize a cat's cataract. You know what we need? A little incentive to keep us inspired to make great masterpieces. Establish a government-sponsored workshop to help up-and-coming writers. I could teach them a few lessons I learned while writing my smash hit."

4. "Uggh, if you can't write in three sentences or less you're being overly wordy," mutters one of your secretaries, while briefly scanning a summary of the erudite malcontents' requests. "If people don't want to read a lot, why force them?"

The Issue
Inspired by the message of environmentalism, @@RANDOM_NAME@@ — the latest scion of an old family — decided to install solar panels on @@HIS@@ home. However, his house is also the centuries-old Summer Palace, a world-famous and highly-prized example of 18th-century @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ architecture.

The Debate
1. "Well, I say @@LEADER@@, this is all fuss over nothing," asserts @@LASTNAME_1@@, while inspecting the nutritional information on the side of a green juice box. "The world will be a wonderful place once everyone pitches in to save the environment. These solar panels cover all the electricity and heating needs of my sixty bedroom ancestral home. I think your government should follow in my footsteps! Put solar panels on every government property to show the world that we mean to take a stand against climate change! Think of the future!"

2. "Simple vandalism, that's what this is," rages Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a lecturer in Enlightenment history, putting @@HIS@@ fist through a priceless stained glass window as @@HE@@ waves @@HIS@@ arms around in anger. "This palace is a unique structure, with key architectural experiments in its design. To cover up the world famous tile-work would be an eyesore and an irreparable blow to historical preservation! You must maintain a list of culturally significant locales that cannot be tampered with, for the sake of posterity. Think of the past!"

3. "Wait, why is an entire property of this size being powered and heated for just one resident?" asks egalitarian socialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ rearranges the documents on your desk into eight stacks of exactly equal height. "We should seize this and other oversized homes as state property, and reassign the living space on a fairer basis to house the homeless. Let's face it - this wealthy landowner's ancestors got their wealth through exploitation and violence. Meanwhile, there's poor people living on the streets, right now! Think of the present!"

[b][anchor=1106]#1106[/anchor]: Some Body to Love [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
Teen pop star @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@ @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ decided to celebrate her birthday and "just legal" status by selling her virginity to the highest bidder. The online auction has now closed, with the winning bid not far off the national average for six months' wages.

The Debate
1. "This is my body and my choice," squeaks @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@ in her annoying trademark high pitch lil' girl voice. "Me and the buyer - whose identity I will absolutely keep confidential - are consenting adults engaging in free market capitalism. Just like in my new song, released next week: [i]Free Love Doesn't Come Cheap[/i]. By the way, have you seen your brother round here? I have a... uh... delivery for him."

2. "This is totally demeaning to womankind!" complains ardent feminist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, her gaze lingering a little too long on the popster's posterior as she leaves the room. "If you care at all about preventing objectification, about human dignity, about the unhealthy false assignation of value to virginity, about the last hundred years of feminist progress, you have to take a stand! Ban this online prostitution, and put money into teaching young girls why they should respect themselves more!"

3. "Half a year's wages!" exclaims your Minister of Equality Juan King in disgust. "And how are the working poor meant to afford a price like that? Everybody should be entitled to a happy ending, not just wealthy fat-cats. You have to set a fixed price tariff for these services, as well as guarantees that a contract will be honoured, rather than leaving customers and prostitutes at the mercy of a free market."

[b][anchor=1107]#1107[/anchor]: Welcome to the Party [Caracasus; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
Party membership applications have never been higher; however, the quality of applicants has never been lower. After nearly one third of new members mistakenly identified a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ revolutionary hero as a popular soap opera star, and nearly two thirds thought that dialectics was something found in tea and coffee, various factions within your party have put aside their bitter rivalries to propose solutions.

The Debate
1. "Our revolution is in danger," bellows @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Junior Undersecretary for Defence and self-described Party Loyalty Commissar. "Every member, new or old, should attend a five hour theoretical Maxist-Lenyoist seminar and vigorously study the [i]Quotations from @@LEADER@@[/i]. Based on this, they must undergo a compulsory loyalty test. If after all of that they still prove to be disloyal hangers-on, a few years mining salt should change their minds."

2. "Well, that's a bit extreme, don't you think?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leaning well out of the way of the flying spittle. "This serious lack of interest surely shows an underlying frustration with our Party's monolithic approach. We should open ourselves up to debate and discourse from every tendency, not just the ones that can learn to parrot party slogans. After all, are we not at our best when we are butting heads in perpetual argument?"

3. "Look on the bright side: Party membership has never been higher," states ruthless pragmatist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Does it really matter if the cat is black or white so long as it catches mice? Let's reward our unwavering supporters with better living accommodation and other... incentives. In exchange, of course, for their undying loyalty to the Party."

The Issue
After several dozen citizens were hospitalized due to drinking from a contaminated batch of moonshine, the people have been at loggerheads over who should have the right to manufacture and distribute spirituous beverages in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
*1. "Let's be realistic here," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, President of the Manufacturing Alliance of Liquor Traders. "These home operations simply do not have the training, the experience, the equipment, or the political connections to be permitted to make their own whiskey! It's all well and good that they talk about freedom, but the members of my association paid good money for their manufacturing licenses, and we maintain the highest standards of quality and purity. The government needs to protect us! People must not be allowed to make their own booze at home." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. "Let's be realistic here," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Director of the Home Oversight Panel for Spirits. "These unsanctioned operations simply do not have the training, the oversight, or the political authorization to be permitted to distill their own spirits! It's all well and good that they talk about seizing the means of production, but the state-run manufactories exist for a reason, and we maintain the highest standards of quality and purity. We must enforce the law! We must not permit the private production of booze." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

**3. "This isn't just some kind of bathtub gin we're talking about," says devoted distiller @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while reviewing the print roll from @@HIS@@ storage cellar's hygrothermograph. "These are artisanal, maker-made, environmentally responsible, non-GMO, craft products that are far better than anything put out by those big-name distilleries! You can taste the difference! If some unscrupulous individual lets heavy metals leech in, or adds something unsafe, that's not the fault of we connoisseurs! The government needs to back off, and give us all the liberty to make what we want in the privacy of our own homes!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**4. "This isn't just some kind of workshed samogon we're talking about," says aspiring distiller @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while reviewing the print roll from @@HIS@@ storage cellar's hygrothermograph.

We're not trying to start a private business here - we just want to make a little something to share amongst friends!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

5. "The bracing effect of a strong drink is absolutely top-notch for getting through the day!" opines Ebrius Foppington, a bearded gentleman wearing a top hat and monocle. "Why, I myself have several such drinks each morning, noon, and night! It helps keep the humors in balance, and makes socializing quite rather more tolerable. Really, we ought to require that everybody over the age of ten make their own suds, and partake regularly to ensure they don't become phlegmatic. Bottoms up!"

6. "Home distilling and compulsory drinking?" shrieks Citizens Against Drinking activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clutching @@HIS@@ heart dramatically. "What kind of horrifying nightmare world are you trying to create? Did you know that, according to the Department of Made-Up Statistics, 47.2% of all crime is related to alcohol? Are you trying to increase that number? What @@NAME@@ needs is to remove alcohol not just from our homes, but from the whole nation! Enact prohibition - there can be no exceptions!"

The Issue
A growing number of citizens are reporting sightings of strange animal behavior since the nation's water supply was drugged, ranging from carelessness and daredevilry to frantic dancing.

The Debate
1. "You guys are the greatest in every way — especially you, dearest @@LEADER@@ — but this contamination is destroying our environment!" exclaims recreational urban habitat observer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sipping from a completely safe glass of government-approved tap water and dribbling some on the floor in @@HIS@@ excitement. "My colleagues and I all witnessed a colony of mice baying at a statue of you. Of course, I see something like that every day... but we all saw it this time! I'm sure you could cut the dosage of drugs in the water down to a safer level and people would still love you!"

2. "Whoa, who cares about, like, a few pesky rats? This water is, like, poisoning our pets, dude," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an enthusiastic pet lover who was particularly thirsty this morning. "You don't have to, like, stop stoning the water, but maybe you should sell some safe water specifically for pets or whatever. You could even make it taste funny to make people not wanna drink it. Then, like, maybe my bunnies won't try to breathe water anymore."

3. "Listen to this buffoonery-talk of baying rodents and suicidal rabbits; it's obvious there is a problem, but not just with animals," rants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a sociologist who's secretly been drinking pond water. "Drugging our water supply is truly despicable, and you bottom feeders must stop it at once!

4.

"If anything, we've got to dump MORE into the water supply! So what if a few people start reacting like the animals?

[b][anchor=1110]#1110[/anchor]: Curtains for the Horrorshow [Sacara; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
After last week's highly anticipated release of the new horror movie "Scary Dream on Fifth Street", reports have been coming in that movie theaters across @@CAPITAL@@ have been allowing children as young as five to watch the film despite the recommendation of ratings boards that the film is suitable only for adults.

The Debate
1. "Oh, the horror!" exclaims @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, president of watchdog group Mothers For Kids' Safeguarding. "The parts with the eating of the brains, the horrible mutilations, that policeman with liberal politics... it was so gut-churningly disgusting, even I stopped watching! These children will be scarred for life! It's time to crack down on movie theaters that are harming our younger generation: everyone, without exception, must provide proof of their age, and any who allow children to watch films rated for adults should be fined and prosecuted!"

2. Seven-year-old @@RANDOM_NAME@@ has seen the movie in question and disagrees. "I liked the film. I especially enjoyed the part where the zombie tore off the man's arms. My mommy says that because I'm a kid, I shouldn't see this movie, but I think the ratings aren't really rules. They're just someone's advice, right? Some of us children are really smart and are totally not as easy to influence as grown-ups think. And if you disagree, then... then... **** you, I'll KILL YOU, you ****ING *********! RAAAAAARGH!" Security drags @@HIM@@ away as @@HE@@ claws at their eyes.

3. "Who needs these kinds of movies in the first place?" asks your grandmother, drinking tea and reminiscing about her younger years. "Back when I raised your parents we didn't have so many scary movies, and look how they turned out. The people who make the movies in the first place should have to test them in front of a young audience, and if even one kid gets scared or upset, the film should be banned.

[b][anchor=1111]#1111[/anchor]: A Call for Change [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Foreign tourists visiting your nation's cities have frequently commented on the high number of vagrants, beggars and panhandlers, especially around the major attractions. Now that the world-renowned [i]Fat Tyreman Travel Guide[/i] has felt the need to specifically write an article called "10 Ways to Dodge Beggars in @@CAPITAL@@", it's probably time you addressed this national embarrassment.

The Debate
1. "Get gone, scum!" commands a police patrolman, displacing a camp of itinerants from a historic park. He turns to you. "Boss, we need more leeway in how we persuade vagrants to move on. I'm not talking about extreme measures here, just judiciously applied threats of arrest, the occasional tap from a truncheon, and maybe a water cannon or two."

2. "You think they want to beg?" complains homeless left-wing protest musician Billy Boast, as he tries to free himself from the policeman's grip. "We, the poor, are being trodden down by the rich. All we want is our fair share! I'm not talking about a socialist revolution here, just a few million social housing units and enough money for the bare necessities of life!"

3. "The problem isn't begging in general, but specifically beggars ruining the ambience of culturally significant sites," observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, from the Tourism Board. "Instead, subsidise construction of fences and walls around tourist attractions, so that only those that have an appropriately pricey entry ticket can enter the tourist areas. I'm not talking about defensive moats here, just some screening partitions to keep the riff-raff out."

4. "Like that cartoon says: Hakuna Matata!" offers jovial beggar Tim Onn, with a little dance. "That means no worries, for the rest of your days! It's not such a bad life out on the street, @@LEADER@@; you should try it for yourself. The open air, the sunshine, the refreshing rain... aaaaahhh! I'm not talking about making yourself homeless, but... hmm... actually, that IS what I'm talking about! To give you the chance to experience the wonderful world of wandering free, me and my buddies will trade possessions with you and your colleagues. Give me your house, your bank account, your jacket, your boots, your motorcyc... Sorry, wrong film. Give us all your stuff, and give the vagrant's life a try. Hakuna Matata!"

The Issue
Following your decision to shoot all stray animals, several "friendly fire" incidents have occurred where household pets have been killed.

The Debate
1. "Not my fault if owned pets look like strays, is it? You should force every pet to be registered nationally, and to wear a collar with a name tag saying who they belong to," suggests Animal Control Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hefting a rifle with a prominent kill tally notched onto the gun's stock. "They can then be taken in, have their owners notified, and be picked up. Of course, if their owners are non-responsive, or they have no identification, then we can safely assume that they're feral and then... BANG!"

2. "Do you know how expensive that'll be?" shouts your Minister of Finance. "Animal control is expensive enough already! Besides, think of all of those poor animals, being killed for nothing. The solution is clear to me. We need to respect the city's ecosystem, and ban the killing of urban wildlife, once and for all."

3. "Why do people have pets anyway?" sniffles allergy-prone police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was bitten by @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@ earlier in the day. "Domestic animals are filthy and vicious, and a burden on society. If we banned them, then animal control officers could shoot any animals they see on the street without worry."

The Issue
Since reproductive sex was banned, a vocal group of slightly twitchy people have formed. Calling themselves the [i]Anti-Sex League[/i], they have attracted members from across society into their ranks, including one of your aunts, two uncles and three senior Ministers. They have taken a lifelong vow of celibacy, claiming recreational sex is a needless distraction in the age of vats.

The Debate
1. "Recreational intercourse is a waste of energy that @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ [i]could[/i] spend productively," huffs @@RANDOMFEMAENAME@@, the League's red sash tightly wound around her hips and swishing as she jogs ceaselessly on the spot. "With compulsory chemical castration the sex instinct would be eliminated. Then @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ would choose to attend community classes on woodwork and entomology, go on long nature hikes and take part in nonstop energetic sports to burn off excess tens... just because they're fun."

2. "This crazy broad may be onto something," mutters your Minister for the Propagation of Leader-Love. "Your every thought is of pleasing @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@, @@LEADER@@.

[3]. "Is that the best you can do?" cackles the Minister of Machiavellianism, twirling his rather stylish pencil moustache. "Puh-lease! I could have coughed that up before breakfast. Picture this: with no contraception, these women get accidentally sprogged-up. We need, ahem, willing sacrifices to the gods or whatever we do human sacrifice for. Hey, if some sad cows don't want their brats sacrificed, they shouldn't have done the four-legged foxtrot." [[color=red]Contraceptives are illegal[/color]; [color=red]Abortion is illegal[/color]; [color=red]Human Sacrifice[/color]]

[4]. "Why ban something that helps improve bonding?" asks @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, your Minister of Misadventures, who looks a lot thicker at the waist than you remember. "Of course, no-one wants to bring children into the world viviparously. We're not sick! We... general, nonspecific people want to have children as nature intended, in a governmental vat. By distributing free contraception to all and permitting abortion, you'd enable people to enjoy an affectionate relationship with their partner without breaking the law."

5. "@@LEADER@@, you're not gonna listen to those repressed nutters in the [i]Anti-Sex League[/i], are you?" groans @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, author of sex-positive guide [i]The Big Book of Bonking[/i]. "You should encourage @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ to adopt a healthy attitude. Perhaps provide more breaks so couples who work different shifts can see each other.

6. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, of the [i]Anti-Pleasure League[/i], opens @@FIRSTNAME_1@@'s book and hurls it across the room, making hand-gestures to ward-off evil. "All these people show an unnatural desire for selfish indulgence. Vacuous pleasure brings societies to their knees. And pleasure begins when coitus and its one purpose are separated. Ban the vats and restore the reproductive function. Teach that congress is a grave task to perpetuate the @@TYPE@@, and not even remotely fun!"

[b][anchor=1114]#1114[/anchor]: Patriotism Flagging [Sacara; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
One afternoon, while taking a stroll through one of @@CAPITAL@@'s more diverse neighborhoods, you notice that many houses are adorned by flags. However, they are all national flags of foreign countries, and not one house is flying the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ flag.

The Debate
1. "Imagine the disrespect it must take to do something like this," resents @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your bodyguard, while pacing up and down the sidewalk. "We are being generous enough to allow these people into our country, and they can't even show their support by flying our flag? Despicable. You must ban the flying of any foreign national flag, and mandate that every @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ graces their house with our great flag, the larger the better! This will show that their true allegiance is to our great @@TYPE@@."

2. One of the residents, whose house is flying a Bigtopian flag, steps outside and joins in. "Just because I have a different flag, it doesn't mean I don't love @@NAME@@. Bigtopia will always have a special place in my heart; it's where I was born and raised. Rather than cracking down on foreign flags, we need to celebrate them. You should hold a flag parade showcasing the many ethnic communities that make up @@NAME@@; it's diversity at its finest!"

3. "I'm telling you, it's those darn immigrants," quips @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your paranoid Minister of the Homeland, who's twitching and itching @@HIS@@ hands furiously. "Without those folks here, we'd be much better off. You must stop any new people from entering our great nation and kick out the ones already here. Then, we'd be pure at last."

[b][anchor=1115]#1115[/anchor]: One in the Arm for @@LEADER@@? [Turbeaux & Tinhampton; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
This morning, you were informed that the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Broadcasting Company is set to air a documentary on the legalization of needle exchanges in Skandilund. These provide sterile needles and allow safe injection sites for addicts to use recreational drugs without fear of arrest. Going by the small crowd gathered outside your office, it appears you weren't the only one to hear about the documentary.

The Debate
1. "My gorgeous little @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ would have been saved if she'd been allowed to inject safely in a public place!" wails @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@, who lost @@HIS@@ daughter to an intravenous heroin overdose last month. "She is not alone - thousands of people die preventable deaths every year as a result of this unfair policy. Not only should we legalize these safe sites, but also provide state counseling and rehabilitation for anybody that looks like she or he may be a drug addict. Why have one death when you can have none?"

2. "I'll just go out on an ominously scarred limb and say that this is a load of nonsense," dryly notes retired sheriff @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, in between discrete sips from a hip flask. "Intervention this, inter-venal that, yet nobody seems to realize that keeping their mitts off drugs is the best way forward for us! Bringing this in would be as good as giving people the go ahead to break the law. We don't want to encourage junkie scum who go around stealing everything that is not nailed down. We'll just punish them like the other criminals."

[3]. "We can't allow any drugs on our streets!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, knocking @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@'s hip flask out of @@HIS_1@@ hands. "It doesn't matter if it's cirrhosis of the liver or my old school friend dying of VODAIS after sharing needles with some whacko she's never met before! The only sane thing to do here is obviously to place a ban on all drugs, including alcohol and tobacco. No need to treat addicts if nobody can obtain addictive substances!"

[b][anchor=1116]#1116[/anchor]: To Each According to His Feed [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
While waiting for a table at the so-called "best restaurant in @@CAPITAL@@", you are told that the chicken has run out, the soufflé is suffering and the vegetable stock is out of stock. Meanwhile, the head chef has defected to the United Federation and the waiters are too proudly socialist to be servile. Despite all this, there's such a mismatch of supply and demand for restaurants that the proletariat have to wait three months to book a table.

The Debate
*1. "Face facts, communism and fancy restaurants are ideologically incompatible," asserts waiter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spitting in a glass, then giving it a polish with a dirty rag. "You need food that reflects our great nation. This, for example, is 'jellyfish with binoculars', a dish from the revolution." @@HE@@ drops a plate in front of you of gelatin chicken and two large shot glasses of vodka. "Restaurants should return to honest proletarian food, for the noble worker. No menus, one dish only, but served with two great things: alcohol and community." [[color=blue]Alcohol is legal[/color]]

*2. "Face facts, communism and fancy restaurants are ideologically incompatible," asserts waiter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spitting in a glass, then giving it a polish with a dirty rag. "You need food that reflects our great nation. This, for example, is 'jellyfish with binoculars', a dish from the revolution." @@HE@@ drops a plate in front of you of gelatin chicken and two large shot glasses of illegally brewed vodka. "Restaurants should return to honest proletarian food, for the noble worker. No menus, one dish only, but served with two great things: alcohol and community. And yes, @@LEADER@@, I'm aware you've banned alcohol. An honest error, I presume?" [[color=red]Alcohol is illegal[/color]]

3. "Drinking till your taste buds go numb is not a solution, comrade," lectures rock farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dragging in a large iron cauldron with a heavy stone rolling around the bottom of it. "The communalist answer here is Proletariat Gumbo — a dish by the people, for the people! Have every diner bring something to add to the restaurant's cooking pot, and in exchange they get a nice bowl of tasty stew. Grated cheese for the greater good. An onion for everyone. A stake in the people's steak!"

4. "Quality service industries can exist in planned economies," insists Minister for the People's Palate @@RANDOM_NAME@@, frowning as @@HE@@ adds a pinch of paprika to the empty cauldron. "We just need to sort out the logistics chains, dedicate state resources to retraining farmers and factory workers into being chefs and waiters, convert high-end weapon factories into haute cuisine restaurants and create a fair system of meal ticket distribution. You say petty bourgeoisie, I say tasty bourguignon. What is the point of state control of wealth if we don't use it to create the good things in life?"

5. "Or you could invite the experts in," says entrepreneur @@RANDOM_NAME@@, strolling into your office uninvited, and setting up @@HIS@@ burger cart in the corner. "Just say the word, and we'll have fine diners built all across your nation. Not just for burger lovers either; there'll also be pizza parlours, fried chicken huts, dealers in doughnut-dunking... Just open up a little bit to capitalist free enterprise, and we can have ourselves a feast!"

[b][anchor=1117]#1117[/anchor]: Suffer Little Children [The Free Joy State; ed:Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The [i]Durum Pulsaverit Academy[/i] — a private educational institution for the offspring of an order of black-clad believers — has caused controversy when it was recently discovered that it was illegally administering corporal punishment on students for a variety of offences, including talking in class and poor penmanship.

The Debate
1. "Our accusers make it sound like there's something cruel going on," intones the school's headmaster Killsin Barbon, who has a bimonthly lifestyle advice column in the order's magazine: [i]The Dour Digest[/i]. "They see not that it is done in love. A love of inflicting pai... piety. Youth is born wicked — disobedient, full of sin and forever questioning that which it pleases not their superiors to tell them — and such wickedness must be driven out. Our graduates are perfect citizens. Their sin-natures of treason and reason ripped from them, they then go through life as a meek and pure-minded mass. You should bring back corporal punishment in all schools. A beating a day keeps the badness at bay."

2. "Merciful Violet! What unnecessary brutality," tuts @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, headmistress of the [i]Creator of Good Counsel Academy[/i]. "Our Creator would never sanction such cruelty on the wayward cherubs. You can discipline them without harshness: writing ten thousand lines, scrubbing graffiti from the wooden desks with a toothbrush, holding a dictionary in each outstretched arm. Teachers who resort to violence show a clear lack of training. All teachers must be taught more functional methods of managing recalcitrant munchkins, and given the necessary tools."

3. "In the name of Her Jaundicedness, no!" An alarmed Marigold @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, Tranquil Yellowist and teacher from the [i]Golden Light Academy[/i], drops the daisy chain she's been making. "This obsession with sin and punishment is precisely why so many see all religious people as nutjobs. Religious-run academies must report any staff member or parent who is suspected of breaking the law to the police, suspending staff from duty until the matter's resolved. All schools must also submit to regular and thorough surprise inspections to prove they are the safe havens they ought to be."

4. "This is why religious schools are harmful," says atheist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Religious schools like [i]Durum Pulsaverit[/i] barricade themselves with closed ideas, and augment them with abusive threats of eternal damnation. Look at this ten-year-old's physics test: 'How does electricity work?', answer: 'We can't know'; 'Why does electricity work?', answer: 'The Creator did it'. The kid got full marks! We should close every religious school, and put the children in state-run secular schools to focus on provable knowledge and scientific fact."

[b][anchor=1118]#1118[/anchor]: We Can't Cross That Bridge When We Get to It [Nedanelden; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
Several workers were killed and others injured in the recent collapse of a bridge being constructed across the @@ANIMAL@@ River.

The Debate
1. "My client's partner was killed in this incident and @@HE@@'s demanding answers!" exclaims litigator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, throwing a stack of folders on your desk. "Hundreds of petitioners, including many of my clients — ah, and the other victims' families — will not be contented with the status quo. They need to know that their loved ones who go to work on these sites will most definitely come home at night. Instituting more safety guidelines might slow down the rate of construction work, but that just means more time to earn a living!"

2. "Objection!" cries prominent attorney @@RANDOM_NAME@@, representing construction firm Bricks An' Stuff. "These destructive laws would merely hinder businesses' ability to perform their job: providing houses to our beautiful citizens, storefronts to our busy workers, and hotel skyscrapers to our guests!" @@HE@@ pats down @@HIS@@ suit before handing you a trunk filled with legislation suggestions. "Offer subsidies to businesses that perform safety checks, and trust companies to carry them out. They know what's best, after all."

3. "Aw, as if we need these damn rules an' stuff!" mutters greying construction worker @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, running while holding power tools. "Real builders don't need them to survive on the job. Back in my day, we worked our butts off like real men, and dealt with problems like these on our own! Get rid of those stupid laws, and let us show these sissies how it's done."

[b][anchor=1119]#1119[/anchor]: Where There Isn't Smoke [Ransium & Caracasus; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Since the smoking ban, tragedy has struck @@NAME@@ as the most hip bars lack a certain je ne sais quoi, formerly smoke-filled back rooms are disturbingly transparent, and withdrawing smokers are beset with torpor. Oh, who are you kidding: powerful tobacco interests, wheelbarrows full of money in tow, have come to your office begging for the law to change.

The Debate
*1. "Productivity has declined in workplaces across the nation and we've got thousands of acres of tobacco plantations going fallow," states ex-Commissar for the Nicotine Production Committee @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The noble worker deserves their smoke break; who are we to take that away from them? Besides, what self-respecting socialist figure would be seen dead without a cigar clenched firmly in their teeth? All the cool communist leaders are doing it; why don't you give it a try?" With that @@HE/SHE@@ discretely stuffs a fine Manamanan cigar into your pocket. [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

*2. "Think of the economic impact of the ban," begs former Nicotine 'R Us CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Tobacco farmers letting their fields go fallow, convenience store workers closing shop after losing their most lucrative products, advertisement agencies forced to switch to making Saturday morning kids cartoons, and yes, the employees of the tobacco companies sent to the poor house. Why, it's tragic!" @@HE/SHE@@ carefully wipes away a single tear with a check for a million bits, and discretely stuffs it into one of your pockets. "The economic stimulus and additional tax revenue of a complete lifting of tobacco restrictions should overcome any paltry health objections." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**3. "Dude, this tax revenue talk has me thinking," murmurs scruffy looking economics professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who smells distinctly skunky to you. "On the one hand, legalizing tobacco and taxing it to the gills will bring in more revenue. On the other hand, legalizing all drugs and taxing them all to the gills will bring in even more revenue, which will then let you lower income taxes. It'll be a total economic multiplier effect... or something. Hey, did you know the word 'hand' is just the word 'and' with an 'h' at the beginning? Freaky." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**4. "It's not just the tobacco plantations that aren't at full capacity," states scruffy looking economics professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sporting a shirt that bears the slogan 'Addiction is a Spook'. "Land across @@NAME@@ could be converted to marijuana plantations, poppy fields, and meth labs. Having the state produce all sorts of drugs could be a huge boost to @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ economic activity. And if you think a smoke break will make the workers more efficient, you should see them after an amphetamine break." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

5. "Is @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ health really for sale?" asks your personal doctor, stethoscope pressed to your chest. "Are kids growing up with parents who are bed ridden due to emphysema worth a few more bits in the coffers of @@NAME@@? How about hospital beds full of lung cancer victims? If anything, you should further discourage any renegade smoke-fiends by raising the penalties for getting caught holding or dealing tobacco."
