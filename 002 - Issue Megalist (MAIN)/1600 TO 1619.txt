[b][anchor=1600]#1600[/anchor]: Mother’s Ruin [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
After losing their jobs when becoming pregnant, an increasing number of mothers are making their living on naughty telephone services such as [i]@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Wenches[/i]. They cite the lack of government support and difficulty in finding alternative employment as being factors that forced this choice.

The Debate
1. “How else am I supposed to support the kids?” asks former solicitor @@RANDOM_NAME_FEMALE_1@@, limp hair hanging over her face and a smear of baby-sick over her shoulder. “My partner works all hours; he never stops. But it’s not enough. If you prevented employers from firing pregnant women and new mothers, we wouldn’t be pressured into taking anything that comes along to make ends meet.” Her phone rings. “Welcome to [i]Fantasies[/i]... Percival? I know it’s you; I recognise the yelp. Listen, we need more nappies. The baby’s got the scoots again...”

2. “@@RANDOM__LAST_NAME_1@@ should count herself lucky! Why should employers have to retain women who may lose skills on their baby break?” sneers your Minister for Harsh Realities or Possibly Just Being a Git, who claims to dream of grey walls every night. “Women taking birthcations cost companies money. No employer should have to employ a woman who may go drop a sprog. Employers should be allowed to ask all potential female employees if they plan on having any children so they can refuse to hire them, [i]and [/i]fire any woman who lies and then gets pregnant. Some may call it discrimination; I call it common sense.”

3. “This just shows how @@NAME@@ is a terrible place to raise children,” says your Minister of Mummies and Ickle-Bickle Bairns, flashing a chart of the worst places to raise children and closing it before you can see. “These years should be precious, not spent trading innuendos to debauchees for a fistful of dollars. We must give all mummies a stipend to stay home until their babies reach adulthood. Mama’s life should be filled with pleasant tasks: blending vegetables from her own garden for baby food, laundering cloth nappies and singing innocent songs about happy @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@. Discourage competitive notions of ‘two incomes’; embrace a traditional, family-focused life.”

4. “This government must make people help themselves!” pontificates your Minister of Bootstraps, ignoring @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@’s baby reaching for a bottle. “Mothers do not need ringfencing from a fair and equal job market; they need for us to encourage employment opportunities. We must create opportunity for all by promoting @@NAME@@ as an open — and low-restriction — place to do business. We could give corporations some relief at the end of the year if they choose to hire or retain parents with dear little infants like... erm... that thing there.”

5. “Wait... you mean Trixie Love isn’t actually a twenty-something single college student desperate to hear from me?” mutters the representative of the League of Single but Very Very Very Available Men, twitching uncontrollably. “This female... woman... lady... these ladies... they’re deceiving us! We should be encouraging honesty in this vital profession! The government should enforce accuracy in all adult entertainment adverts, and should maybe give grants to young, hot ladies who are looking to start their adult entertainment career. [i]Girls of @@NAME@@ — Your Country Needs You! Come to Us![/i] I’ll... I’ll be in my bunk.”

[b][anchor=1601]#1601[/anchor]: At Death’s Door [Sedgistan; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Elderly widow @@RANDOM_NAME_FEMALE_1@@ died alone at the age of 92. Her body wasn’t discovered until 3 years later, by which point it had been eaten by her cat Snookums, who was in turn eaten by her pet rats after they chewed their way out of their cage, before they were devoured by a swarm of cockroaches.

The Debate
1. “This shows a shocking lack of compassion, care and community in this nation!” remonstrates social worker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has shown @@HIS@@ own lack of compassion for your needs by insisting you accompany @@HIM@@ to the deceased’s flat. “@@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ was only discovered after the postman couldn’t stuff another envelope through her letterbox — not one of the neighbours ever thought to check on her.” @@HE@@ shakes a fist down the hallway at a series of closed doors. “If people won’t care, they must be made to. It should be mandatory for citizens to carry out weekly welfare checks on their neighbours.”

[2]. “This is revolting!” shrieks accountant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has just picked up a manila envelope from beneath a pile of cockroach carcasses. Opening it, @@HE@@ shoves a letter from the welfare department in your face. “Think of all the wasted pension overpayments we’ve been making for three years! It’s high time we send government agents out to inspect welfare recipients, to ensure they are still entitled — that way we can turn the financial taps off the second they croak.” [[color=purple]Must have some non-zero Welfare[/color]]

3. “What a tragic waste. You know, I don’t see why we allow people to live alone,” muses local government officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, idly twirling a small rib bone on a dusty cat bed. “Humans are sociable creatures at heart, and what with the housing pressures our ever-expanding population faces, it makes much more sense to require homeshares for those that find themselves without company. If old @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ had had a young roommate assigned to live with her, this whole mess could have been avoided, and perhaps the cat might have survived too.”

4. On your return to the office, you look to your longest-serving advisor, sat peacefully in the corner. They haven’t piped up for a while now. They don’t say anything, but somehow between their fixed grin and unblinking stare, you understand what they’re saying — leave the dead where they were happy, to enjoy their rest among their own belongings; why disturb them?[/box]

[b][anchor=1602]#1602[/anchor]: @@NAME@@’s Bark Worse Than Its Byte? [Varanius; ed: Westinor][/b]

The Issue
Metrix, a new video game by @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ game designer Alex E. Digitnov, was reportedly smuggled out of @@NAME@@ on a USB stick and has since locked down the attention of populations across the world — much to the chagrin of @@NAME@@’s autarkic policymakers.

The Debate
1. “No! This isn’t how they’re supposed to play the game!” rages Minister of Homeland Security @@RANDOM_NAME@@, throwing barrels out the window in @@HIS@@ weekly temper tantrum. “It’s about the [i]principle[/i] — how can anyone take us seriously as an autarky if we can’t even tell when our goods are whisked away from our nation like princesses from a castle? For all we know, Digitnov could be receiving foreign bonuses on the side for his activities! Clearly, we are not secure — we need to conduct an extensive and thorough investigation of every citizen’s economic pursuits to ensure no criminal activities are occurring in @@NAME@@. If anyone is found stepping over the ambiguous line even a little bit, we hard drop the law on their faces!”

2. “That won’t fix it,” growls “Smash-It” Sam, a hulking menace who intimidated his way to the top of the armed forces. “@@NAME@@ is better off alone, and it’s about time the world got that. Demand that every other nation and their citizens hand over all versions of Metrix and delete all traces of its existence, and put more heavily armed guards at every entrance, bigger and better walls, and maybe a ridiculously complicated maze or two — it’s game over for any dastardly heroes... er, smugglers!”

*3. “Surely we’re not that upset about a few silly trade regulations, right?” nervously chuckles Digitnov, sporting a suspiciously Maxtopian jacket over a poorly covered [i]I love United Federation City[/i] T-shirt. “I mean, would it really be that bad if I could start selling my game to foreigners? More money in my pocket means I can spend more money on pure Canine goods, after all! I would just be giving a little buff to the Canine economy — and really, there’s nothing wrong with playing a little co-op with our friendly neighbors, right? It’ll all trickle down to the people eventually. Win-win!” [[color=blue]Allows private industry[/color]]

*4. “Surely we’re not that upset about a few silly trade regulations, right?” nervously chuckles Digitnov, sporting a suspiciously Maxtopian jacket over a poorly covered [i]I love East Lebatuck[/i] T-shirt. “I mean, I know we take this whole ‘autarky’ business seriously, but I- er, we have a great opportunity here! This is a great source of government funds, and more money in your pocket means more funds for government projects and a little buff to the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ economy. After all, there’s nothing wrong with playing a little co-op with our friendly neighbors, right? What could be truer to the socialist spirit?” [[color=red]Does not allow private industry[/color]]

5. “You guys are total killjoys!” whines your acne-covered nephew, furiously button-mashing on a controller. “Oh, that was sick! What was I saying? Right, this game rocks! In fact, why are we gatekeeping it with a price tag? We should be helping as many people get their hands on it as possible — yeah, eat that, loser! You know what, if we give the game away to foreigners for free, we can maintain our economic independence and keep our autarky! Seems easy to me.” He groans as his console plays a defeat sound effect. “Oh, come on! I wasn’t paying attention!”

[b][anchor=1603]#1603[/anchor]: Searching for That Special Someone [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
Your PR team have discovered that when you type “idiot”, “fool”, or “special needs” into the image search function of the nation’s most popular search engine, there are at least half a dozen pictures of you, @@LEADER@@, on the first page.

The Debate
1. “Whoogle? More like Scroogle, am I right? They’ve always been biased against our politics,” jeers your Secretary of State, whose recent WhoTube rant was taken down by moderators for being ‘disgustingly offensive’. “These tech giants are unelected arbiters of internet content, skewing the perceptions of the masses according to their own hidden agenda. We need to set up a government-backed organisation that monitors them for bias, and fines them accordingly.” [[color=blue]Allows private industry[/color]]

*2. “Baipigu? More like doo-doo, am I right? They’ve always been running dogs of the bourgeoisie, despite being nominally under our control,” jeers your Minister of Truth, whose recent ProleTube rant was taken down by moderators for being ‘disgustingly offensive’. “These tech giants are unelected arbiters of internet content, skewing the perceptions of the masses according to their own hidden agenda. We need to bring them under direct government supervision, monitor their operations for libelous political ideas, and fine them accordingly.” [[color=red]Does not allow private industry[/color]]

*3. “We use complex neural algorithms that base results on associations created by user uploads and metatags,” defends Whoogle CEO Sunder Pikachu, making a brief stop in your office after providing testimony to a government committee on meme addiction. “It’s not us calling you an idiot, it’s the people. If you value internet neutrality, then you’ll grow a thicker skin, and guarantee us freedom from government censorship.” He smiles winningly, then mutters something that sounds like “you idiot” under his breath as he turns to leave. [[color=blue]Allows private industry[/color]]

*4. “We use complex neural algorithms that base results on associations created by user uploads and metatags,” defends Baipigu administrator Yi Lanhong, making a brief stop in your office after providing testimony to a government committee on meme addiction. “It’s not us calling you an idiot, it’s the people. If you value internet neutrality, then you’ll grow a thicker skin, and guarantee us freedom from censorship.” He smiles winningly, then mutters something that sounds like “you idiot” under his breath as he turns to leave. [[color=red]Does not allow private industry[/color]]

5. “Well, maybe we can improve things without opposing freedom of expression,” suggests a tech-savvy aide who was in the middle of setting up a new router. “We can aggressively manipulate this search engine to ensure your political opponents are made to look ridiculous. It’s simple: just use their algorithms to our advantage by applying our own tags and metadata to things. Like, maybe we can post that picture of the opposition leader’s partner looking like an ape, and get that trending. Move with the times, and you can win the memetic war.”

6. “Have you considered the possibility that you ARE an idiot?” challenges your stern aunt, smacking you round the back of the head. “Think for five seconds before you open your mouth. Dress smartly. Be polite to everybody. Avoid saying controversial things. If you want to get respect, be respectful to others, you little fool.”

7. “Ban the internet!” shouts your Minister of Equality, waving her arms about. “Sorry, no, I only yelled that to get your attention. Actually, the real problem here is that people are still using ‘special needs’ as an insult. Can you please invest some more in educating the masses in language sensitivity and respect for the disabled? Don’t ban the internet, by the way. That’d be crazy.”

[b][anchor=1604]#1604[/anchor]: Prison of the Mind [Thal Dorthat; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
By utilising psychoactive drugs that affect time perception, researchers believe that they can make a month feel like a year, albeit with most of this time spent in a medically induced stupor with vivid, time-compressed dreams. Legislators are now wondering if they could use this to reduce the strain on the prison system, effectively delivering 12 years of experienced prison time within a single year of realtime.

The Debate
1. “Think of the savings!” enthuses Minister for Justice @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is rumoured to use the drugs to enhance @@HIS@@ weekends. “I don’t know why people think this is a controversial subject. The drugs reduce the duration of jail sentences, effectively creating extra prison capacity and shortening the time before they can re-enter society. Come on @@LEADER@@, if we snooze — like the prisoners — we will lose.”

2. “Sentencing a person to a dream is undoubtedly a cruel and unusual punishment, and forcing drugs on inmates is just horrifying,” argues your Minister of Human Rights, who hasn’t slept well since the ‘giraffe poo incident’ last year. “If we go down this route then depression, detachment from reality, mental trauma, and even suicide will be more likely. Please, wake up and declare these drugs illegal under any circumstances, prisons included.”

3. “These innovations could transform all of society,” says industry bigwig @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a greedy glint in @@HIS@@ eye. “Way I see it, perceived time off is as good as actual time off. Imagine mandatory seven day weeks for fifty-one weeks a year, but workers experiencing all the benefits of twelve weeks off per annum. National productivity would shoot skywards! A dream come true!”

[b][anchor=1605]#1605[/anchor]: Hungry for Criticism [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
In the months following the anorexia-related death of teenager Velma Wiggum, investigators discovered that she was a member of various online communities that glorify eating disorders. Her computer had multiple pictures of seriously underweight people, and her social media was filled with encouragement from others to keep starving herself.

The Debate
1. “This is entirely the fault of social media,” says the teenager’s father, who is best known for his work as a fashion photographer. “These sites should be held criminally responsible for ill-considered content, and should be forced to provide the identities of people in these murder-groups to the police. There’s no greater emptiness than the loss of a child, and those who are to blame must be punished.”

2. “This was a tragic loss, of course, but actually let’s not forget that social media is all about connecting people,” spins Nicky Clogg, PR director of a social media site whose name ironically and accidentally translates as ‘dead’ in an ancient language. “The data-gathering algorithms we employ already identify at-risk users, and target advertising... uh, I mean... signpost appropriate support networks for those vulnerable individuals. Of course, we offer discounted rates to charitable organisations who use our systems to deliver their message, which we’d happily extend to the government-funded eating disorder clinics I expect you’ll want to be setting up. You could say that our automated software is automatically saving lives!”

*3. “Internet and media all around us, is it any wonder that we all have a hunger?” questions Reverend Florence X. Machina, standing before an altar beneath a statue of an emaciated man in a loincloth. “A spiritual hunger, that is. The dog days can be over, if for only a few hours each week we are all obliged to turn off all electronic devices and attend church. It’s always darkest before the dawn, but with minds filled with holy truth rather than horrible tweets, we can raise us up, raise us up.” [[color=purple]Does not have low religiousness[/color]]

[b][anchor=1606]#1606[/anchor]: Book Off [The Free Joy State; ed: Pogaria][/b] 

The Issue
After the village council of @@ANIMAL@@-O’er-the-Wold passed a law last month which permits parents to challenge books they found inappropriate — leading to their removal from schools and libraries — pressure group Mothers Injuncting Literary Filth have challenged 3989 books. Impacted titles include everything from preschool favourite [i]Pongo Penguin and His Papas[/i] to the feminist dystopia [i]The Handmaiden’s Missive[/i].

The Debate
1. “Ugh, no!” whimpers group founder Rosalia Medina, scouring the children’s classic [i]Billie the Beaver[/i], in which a lost beaver wanders around the forest searching for her home. “You have no idea how many times this degenerate book uses the word ‘dam’ — and that’s before we get to the grotesque sexual content. I mean, a beaver! And Mr. Owl gives her sticks, and we [i]all[/i] know what sticks stand for — naughty stuff. And then Mr. Sparrow invites her in to ‘munch on his lunch of berries and cherries’, and we [i]all[/i] know what that [i]really[/i] means — naughty stuff. And then at the end of the book, when she finally gets home, there’s a beaver party, and everyone’s invited! @@LEADER@@, you must adopt this law nationwide so my group can remove all the unadulterated filth they’re foisting on our children.” 

2. “I hope this woman doesn’t have kids,” snorts self-proclaimed ‘moderate book burner’ Roxanne Stone, as Medina shouts in reply that she “can’t stand the things.” “Obviously, some extremists have become overzealous. I mean, banning a wordless picture book because it featured two men hugging in the background... that’s insane. But @@ANIMAL@@-O’er-the-Wold is on the right side of history here. Take [i]Adored[/i]: it’s a vile book with bad language, racism, and grotesque violence — this runaway slave killed her own baby when the slaveowner found her! We need a national scheme that restricts offensive content that our young people are just not mature enough to handle.” 

3. “Our kids are a lot tougher than their parents think,” insists educator Alexandra Bulsara, whose students have been spiritedly debating the Mayor of @@ANIMAL@@-O’er-the-Wold’s record on poverty and why that might lead him to endorse banning the Depression-era novel [i]The Wine of Resentment[/i]. “They’re much smarter than their parents give them credit for, or their parents. You have to suppress this backwards berg’s attempt to stifle intellectualism and dumb-down our libraries and schools, revelling in humanity’s worst instincts to baby children and ensure another generation so stupid and insular that they’d vote for the current mayor. Book bans must be outlawed nationwide. There is no reason to ban any book: words can’t hurt anyone.” 

4. “Look,” sighs your Minister of Minimum Effort, who fancies herself a comedian, “everyone knows that @@ANIMAL@@-O’er-the-Wold is the anus of @@NAME@@. You’ve heard that joke about the Woldian who was dressing up for dinner, so he put on a T-shirt without cut-off sleeves. To be honest, I’m surprised they had that many books to ban; Woldians aren’t exactly known for reading — they call fast-food menus ‘books’.” She chortles at herself. “You gotta let the less-developed regions take responsibility for their own people. Just launch a pro-reading campaign to keep it from spreading and forget about the Wold. Those kids are probably gonna get stuck in a swamp anyway.”

[b][anchor=1607]#1607[/anchor]: My Chemical Romance [Millenhaal; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
A man in @@CAPITAL@@ suffered a widely publicized death after drinking a concoction sold to him by an esoteric medicine vendor. He had ingested the liquid — which contained lead, arsenic, and other toxic substances — because he had been told it was a love potion that would increase his charisma and help him attract his beloved.

The Debate
1. Bursting into your office with various animal body parts around her neck, Madame Marie-Claudette de Yves Sant-Junien, the mystic who sold the potion, seals the door with spirit tape and then dashes over to your desk. “We have made these mixtures for thousands of years; the lead and arsenic are key components! His Riparochakras just didn’t agree with the Orthosophistic Macrocalibration of the elixir’s Phorliant Mesograde. If you want to respect our religious freedom, you’ll surely agree that all existing regulations on what can be ingested by humans need to be exempt from applying to magic. Now, can I interest you in a good luck potion? You’ll need it when there’s a coup next week!”

2. “Woah there, it is SO not groovy that these little numbers are sendin’ people to the sky, man,” says your Minister of Peace, Love, and Bureaucracy, swirling around one of the Madame’s potions until it starts glowing bright blue. “We should, I dunno, make a Ministry of Radical Brewskis to approve potions for sale, and ensure only approved mystical healers that have been thoroughly vibe-checked by the government can administer them. By the way, I saw your niece making some bogus mud pies without written approval. Keep your fam in line, ya dig?”

3. “Oh please, we all know there’s no way to increase romantic attractiveness; otherwise I’d have whipped something up to make Stacy go to Senior Prom with me!” asserts @@DEMONYM_ADJECTVE@@ Secularist Society spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sporting a plaid fedora. “The bottom line is that people are gullible and easily tricked by bad actors. If we allow these harmful things to exist, more people will die from false remedies. Sure, some folks want the right to choose how they’re healed, but if the government’s job is to protect its citizens, that should mean eliminating these substances. If people are really having so much trouble finding a partner, the Ministry of Human Services should direct them towards some like-minded support groups that might help out.”

[b][anchor=1608]#1608[/anchor]: G’s Louise [Verdant Haven; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
A recently announced prototype for the next generation of mobile data technology has resulted in as many fears as cheers, with meteorologists claiming that the radio frequencies it uses will interfere with the signals needed by satellites for weather forecasting across @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. “I hate to rain on your parade,” frets government meteorologist and avowed nephophile Ásmunda Wynne, “but water vapor is uniquely detectable at 23.8GHz... the same frequency this new technology uses! If this gets deployed, every cell tower will show up as if it were a giant cloud. What do you expect farmers to do without accurate forecasting? Are fishermen supposed to rely on sky color again? I don’t even know what generation cellular providers are up to now... 6G? 15G? 100G? It doesn’t matter — you can’t change physics. If you have to make them use less-than-ideal frequencies to avoid interfering with our satellites, it’s worth it!”

2. “Gray skies are gonna clear up!” promises early adopter and staunch netophile Federico Dunn, as he narrowly avoids walking into your doorframe while looking at his phone. “I’ve heard that at high frequencies, the propagation range of a signal is quite short, and it’s not like we need to install antennas in places nobody lives. The fact is, I... err, I mean... everybody wants this tech! Just put some regulations in place that limit disruptive signals to populated areas. If people care that much about rain, they can just look out the window, right?”

3. “We’ll weather the weather whatever the weather, so long as we stay inside!” announces professed nyctophile Lana Liu, via video chat from the windowless basement where she lives. “This technology is merely a stepping-stone to Infini-G and beyond, and with that kind of bandwidth we can all just stay indoors forever! Fire the meteorologists, and any other naysayers who get in our way, and pump that money into the IT sector so we can develop teleworking backbones, automated factories, and who knows what else! We’ll never have to worry about facing the weather again!”

4. “Turn off that camera!” hisses notorious omniphobe Randy Sharp, pulling his hood tight around his face. “Data already moves plenty fast! Sometimes too fast, if you catch my drift. You know what this is? It’s a system for emitting mind-control rays! Satellites, cellular towers, these ‘G’s’ people keep talking about... they work together to track people, and to force honest @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ like me to carry out the whims of the secret international cabal of the lizard people! Outlaw all future work on these so-called advances at once!”

[b][anchor=1609]#1609[/anchor]: One Big Watering Hole [Noahs Second Country; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
With all of the issues currently facing @@NAME@@, one of your advisors has suggested taking some time at a golf course to clear your head. However, upon arriving at the first green, a small yet audible crowd of pro-environment protesters are trying to force yet another decision upon you.

The Debate
1. “Golf is an activity for the wealthy and wasteful,” lobs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, crawling out of a sand bunker. “Golf courses take up huge swaths of land, in addition to their astronomical use of water, and for what? So that some fat cats can hit balls and drive around little carts, calling it a ‘sport’. Ban golf courses and re-purpose them into nature reserves!”

2. “FORE!!!” shouts Mickelson Woods, a golfing enthusiast wishing to play through. “That duffer just wants to handicap the whole nation; how could we properly meet to discuss finer things like the economy without golf? As for the environment, courses are already natural spaces and we only use waste water on the fairways! So why spend all that money converting one green into another? If you’re worried that only a certain section of society gets to use these areas, why don’t you subsidize access for the less well off?”

3. “Look, I know it’s tough to swallow, but size matters,” chips Willy Snead Jr, largely obscured by a golf bag. “Golf is a game of inches anyway, so let’s shrink our expectations down into something more comfortable and realistic — miniature golf! It’s affordable for everyone and courses can be built in cities, so there’ll be no more concerns about environmental damage. I see miniature golf courses everywhere, complete with obstacles, fake grass, and government subsidies!”
