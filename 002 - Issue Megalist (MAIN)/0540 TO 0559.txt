[b][anchor=540]#540[/anchor]: Shh! Spoilers! [Katalaysia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
After one of your recent speeches included an accidental spoiler for the bestselling novel Hexicon, angry librarians, teenagers, and fantasy aficionados have completely surrounded your office in protest. After a hard day's work, you have agreed to meet with the protesters, if only so that you can get out of the building.

The Debate
1. "Speeches, not spoilers!" chants your teenage niece, who has been leading the protest. "Look, I'm trying to be a good citizen here, paying attention to what's going on around me, but if you're going to spoil something that I haven't even had chance to read, then I'm not going to bother! If you really need to talk about stuff that isn't politics in your speeches, at least warn us about it! Sure, it might look a bit silly, but who cares? This is almost as bad as when I was told that Planet of the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ was @@REGION@@ all along!"

2. "Can't these people get a life?" asks your visibly tired speechwriter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has been shredding hate mail all day. "Simply say something appeasing, then carry on your business as you normally would. Honestly, I wish I had the free time to read; then I'd finally find out why everyone keeps getting so upset about this Dumbledore business. Besides, wouldn't referencing pop culture make you 'cool' and 'with it', as the kids are saying these days?"

3. "Who cares what 'rosebud' meant, or who was the real Caesar So-say? There's more to life than fiction," observes your always serious Finance Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is known around the office as a total buzzkill. "What's important here is that you've given a lot, and I mean a lot of publicity to that hack of an author, and he hasn't paid us a single cent! Maybe if people are going to care so much about what you talk about in those speeches of yours, we should be getting companies to pay for the privilege of being mentioned. Sure, some may call it 'bribery' and 'unethical', but there's no such thing as free advertising."

4. "Spoilers must be banned!" wails George JK Token, the beloved and bearded fantasy author of Hexicon and the popular A Play of Crowns series. "It's of no coincidence that mere days after you spoiled my book, it fell from its number one position on the @@CAPITAL@@ Times best seller list. Spoilers greatly harm the publishing and entertainment industries. Nobody wants to bother with something if they know how it ends! I urge you to make it illegal to spoil. If you don't, well, then I just might have to kill off Aya Lark in the next Play of Crowns book, seeing how she's your favorite character."

[b][anchor=541]#541[/anchor]: Spare The Whip, Spoil The Law [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed: Logophilia Lyricalia][/b]

The Issue
This past week the legislature shot down a flagship law, setting back your whole agenda at least a year. Considering your party had a comfortable majority and should easily have passed the bill, your inner circle has been considering what kind of discipline to impose on parliamentary rebels.

The Debate
1. "I'm telling you, police those fools!" shouts an angry @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the legislator who co-authored the proposed law with you. "No, I mean literally! Have the building security officers march around in full riot gear, looking every MP right in the eye! I dare any of my lily-livered colleagues to defy our will THEN! A strong and unified party means a strong and unified @@NAME@@, whatever those opposition goons may blather."

2. Loyalist legislator Francis Woodheart has other ideas on what to do with the rebels. "We really don't need anything quite so drastic, my friend. We can police ourselves! Just appoint me as 'whip,' and then I can use the power of persuasion on any party members who won't fall in line. Don't like the government's budget proposal? That's a shame, I really wanted to drop your name in @@LEADER@@'s ear for that open cabinet post..."

3. "Members of our legislature have ALWAYS voted according to their conscience," bellows @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the dissenters. "That bill would have destroyed our way of life in Northwest @@NAME@@, and we won't allow that to happen! You snooty @@CAPITAL@@ scalawags keep flogging the same old dead horses, trying to bulldoze our culture, and we're plum sick of it. There've gotta be more safeguards against partisan and sectional tyranny. We need to have local control of local issues, and institute a secret ballot in the legislature. Only then are we safe from the storm of wrath and repercussions - from you, from the donors, or from the voters."

4. "Uh, speaking of voters..." mutters Sandy Berman, the Minister of Domestic Affairs. "Remember them? You're all so focused on getting your own agendas passed that you've forgotten why we're here in the first place! The voters didn't send us here to squabble like screaming children about who didn't support someone's National Moose Empowerment Act! They want us to get things done, and they'll bring home anyone who's not pulling their weight. Recall elections will make those rebels the local whipping boys. Forget secret ballots, we need to SPREAD the word who voted for what - the electorate will send us the right people if we just give them a chance."

5. "This word 'whip' has me thinking," ponders your old friend and chief-of-staff @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Brutus, who is also the odds-on favorite to replace you one day. "What if we let everyone vote as usual, but every time some upstart so-called 'statesman' votes against your wishes, you ACTUALLY get to whip them! Live, in the public square! Wouldn't that be a delicious spectacle? The sting of the lash, the sound of leather striking flesh... I can't imagine anyone wanting to lead @@NAME@@ without it."

[b][anchor=542]#542[/anchor]: What A Waste [Atomic Utopia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Nuclear energy, the source of much of your growing nation's electricity, has been generating radioactive waste as a by-product. As the shadows cast by the mounting piles of warning-emblazoned concrete casks grow ever longer, a concerned populace is looking to you for a more permanent solution.

The Debate
1. "There's a boring and sensible approach," suggests corduroy-clad grey-haired engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, rolling out a blueprint in front of you and ignoring the yawns of those attending the presentation. "Deep geologic disposal. My team has determined several sites for the construction of an extremely deep shaft underground to dispose of the nuclear waste. It's relatively inexpensive, we can mostly guarantee that the waste will never reach the surface, and it will be far safer than our current storage system. Exciting stuff, eh?"

2. "Let me tell you a story," says Stanley Leigh, the local representative of protest group Citizens Rejecting Atomic Power. "One day, some bad companies mix up this toxic cocktail that can poison people for thousands or millions of years. Then, they bury it, and think nothing more of it. Then, some kid in ten thousand years winds up a one-eyed mutant cyclops, and has no clue why. Turn off the reactors, buddy, and find a better way. Sure it's hard, but people like us have to make hard decisions."

3. "Once again, Science has the answer!" proclaims physics professor @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, striking her best heroic pose and pointing symbolically to the distant horizon. "Vitrification! Ion exchange! Synroc! We can separate out the components of the waste, burn off the long-lived stuff in fast reactors, reallocate the plutonium to weapons manufacture, and leave only short-lived waste that lasts merely hundreds of years. This will mean that we will not run out of fuel, and the environment will be spared from contamination. Increased industrial expenses? Yes. Necessary security costs and extensive safety regulations? Yes, sure, whatever. But, awesome Super Science? Triple yes, yes, yes!"

[4]. "I feel ashamed to be offering you an even better and easier solution, one that won't cost you a thing and might even make you a little money," simpers Snidely Industries CEO Cornelius Davidson Snidely while twirling his handlebar moustache. "Why, this waste could be sold to some very special international clients who would be very discreet about where they bought it from. I just recently sold them a batch of suitcases and plenty of dynamite: your waste products are the last missing ingredient they need. Dirty money from dirty bombs? No... clean profit margins from a clean sale!" [[color=blue]Must have Private Industry[/color]]

[b][anchor=543]#543[/anchor]: Flash, Aaaaaargh! [The Called; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A flash mob caused a public health risk and thousands of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in damage after being directed by an online user calling himself Flashy_G. Apparently, the stunt has left the affected area suffused with a choking stench and at least six terrified onlookers have been admitted to hospital with panic attacks and nervous breakdowns. Many of those impacted are demanding you take action.

The Debate
1. "They can't keep getting away with this," states Chief of Police @@RANDOM_NAME@@ calmly, eyes fixed on a slow motion playback of the incident's CCTV footage. "This snot nosed little punk wasted an entire day's worth of police time with unnecessary evacuations and dealing with panicking crowds. An online perpetual ID system should be used, so home-grown terrorists can't hide behind their shrouds of anonymity."

2. "I thought it was pretty funny," says Barry Yalen, an itchy-looking teenager scratching at his crotch. "All he said was that it might be droll if a couple of thousand people all showed up to the mall on Tuesday the 18th at 11:32 am and did the Lice Bucket Challenge. He never TOLD anyone to do it. Just that, you know, it'd be funny if people did! You can't start getting mad at people for saying something would be cool. Don't step on our freedoms, man!"

3. "We shouldn't infringe freedom of speech, but we need to do something," grumbles janitor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wielding a pest-spray and mop. "As far as I'm concerned, it's the kids who empty out buckets of bugs who need to be punished. If I told them to jump in front of a bus, would they do it? Personal responsibility is what I'm talking about - have the system sentence all two thousand of these idiots, and put them to community service making the nation a better place."

4. "You know the real problem is how fast Flashy_G was able to spread chaos," observes your Minister of Memetic Warfare, carefully replacing the ink cartridge in her fountain pen. "These little online social media apps can reach hundreds of thousands of people in seconds. That's faster than the police can act or we can counter it. This could escalate from pesky teens spreading pests, to actual mobs destroying our government. On the other hand, if we can control the flow of information, then we can control the country. My people can secretly take control of the social media sites and track down this troublemaker and any others who emerge. Then, rather than silence them, we can adjust their activities to suit our needs."

[b][anchor=544]#544[/anchor]: Object-Oriented Programming [Lubrumia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Triple-A videogame title "Panty Theft Auto" has caused a stir amongst feminists and concerned parents, with many demanding government action against objectification and sexualization of women in the game industry.

The Debate
1. "This is disgusting!" cries Alice N. Beck-Dell, a proudly feminist media commentator. "Look at these bimbos in all of these games! They'd need back braces to stand up if they were real! The male protagonist can rack up passive female conquests, and even gets a set of pornographic virtual trading cards for each one he collects. Can't we apply some modern day standards to this growing industry, to limit the objectification? Drooling teenage boys might admittedly be a significant market, but there are adult and women gamers too! Isn't some censorship worth it, for a less misogynistic society?"

2. "You can't be serious," complains Stan Houser, creative director of the game, covertly slipping you some special edition artwork of a chain-mail bikini elf-knight in a brown paper bag. "I like pretty girls. My customers like pretty girls. Pretty girls sell games. It isn't the job of the gaming industry to spread a social message and if these moral crusaders don't like it, they don't have to buy the game. Don't restrict the free market, or freedom of expression."

3. "Whatever Panty Theft Auto is doing is what we real men want!" squeaks nerdy 13-year old @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, stroking his caterpillar-like moustache as he sneaks the chainmail-elf picture into his own pocket. "If anything, we should apply this principle to every piece of media we make and import! Instead of making a censor board, you should have an UNcensor board! Give every female huge pair... uh... personality! Add CGI cut-scenes where we can give these ladies what they need! Hell, make sure ALL media is as sexy as hell! Not only it would benefit us men, it would benefit the economy too!"

4. "The problem here isn't some video games, it's ALL video games," observes disbarred attorney Tom Jackson, peering at you over a stack of lawsuit documents. "Video games keep kids - and adults for that matter - on the couch all day. They rot brains, cause moral decay and encourage violence. I'm not blaming kids here, I'm blaming the media we feed them: don't hate the players, hate the game! Ban this trash, and get kids back outdoors playing healthy and wholesome games like mumbletypeg or pinfinger!"

The Issue
As an election looms, a controversy arose when an elderly war veteran who lived in Brancaland for the past thirty years was thrown out of an advance polling station. Other @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ living abroad are now demanding that they be allowed to vote, prompting angry responses from voters living in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "We should damn well get a vote!" splutters @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, the expat at the heart of the furore, over the phone from his Brancalandian retirement resort. "We are born and bred citizens of @@NAME@@ and we are entitled to the same basic rights as everyone else, including the right to suffrage. You fascists can't deny us that! Yeah, okay, so the outcome probably won't affect me personally, but I have family in @@CAPITAL@@! Maybe I will come back home someday. Maybe."

2. "Absolute nonsense," refutes pawnbroker, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, after taking a break from trying to sell your frustrated staffers a defective blender supposedly owned by the former Mayor of @@CAPITAL@@. "These traitors are whining and entitled shysters who chose to leave our great country, but now want a say in how @@NAME@@ is governed? You can't just waltz back to the home you abandoned and think you understand what life is like here! Restrict voting to all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ who still live in the homeland. Those living abroad can cry into their Manamana tequilas for all I care!"

The Issue
Freegans - people who eat food, wear clothes, and use other goods retrieved from trash bins - have created a big stink across @@NAME@@. They've especially gotten up the noses of retail business owners, who say the practice pongs. The disputants have dumped themselves in your office, insisting you dispose of the issue.

The Debate
1. "Freeganism promotes environmental responsibility by reducing consumption," says Gaia @@ANIMAL@@ Rainbow, while rifling through your waste basket and pocketing a piece of used gum. "Our consumerist economy wastes an obscene amount of natural resources by throwing away perfectly good and usable items! In fact, most food that reaches it's 'sell by' date is still perfectly safe to eat. Greedy corporate interests are slapping the faces of the poor, the wretched and the needy when you consider how much they waste. The government needs to support freegans, and help us trash waste!"

2. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, President of the @@CAPITAL@@ Chamber of Commerce, passes around free embossed air fresheners before interjecting. "That smelly anarchist fails to mention the huge mess created by everyone digging around in our dumpsters, which scares away our customers! Eating expired food out of the trash is dangerously unhealthy, not to mention totally gross. Look, the bottom line is we're losing business because of these vultures. Can you get the police to arrest them? If they want food and clothing, they should have to work hard to buy them like any other @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@."

3. "YO! DOWN HERE!" bellows a voice through your office window. You look down at the street to see @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a municipal garbage collector. "Look, it ain't safe to have people diggin' through dumpsters. But hey, I get it. It ain't right to have good food thrown away when so many are hungry. YO SAL!" The worker whacks the side of the truck a couple of times, and the compactor inside begins to roar. "Why don't you boost welfare spendin', and require shops to donate past-'sell-by'... wha?... um, but safe goods to food banks? Make 'em an offer they can't scrap."

[b][anchor=547]#547[/anchor]: Fantastic Beasts And How @@NAME@@ Harmed Them [Outer Sparta; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A shocking exposé on tourist attraction OceanWorld has revealed the mistreatment of captive orcas and other marine animals. Your office has since faced a tidal wave of complaints demanding government action.

The Debate
1. "This is torture!" shouts renowned whale biologist Willy Free, seen wearing an orca costume. "These poor and mistreated creatures can't experience their natural habitat, and frankly live solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short lives! They can handle living in the wilderness and thrive better there. We must end these inhumane captivity programs. The same can go for zoos, circuses, and aquariums, too."

*2. "You can't do that, you ignorant whale lovers!" pleads CEO of OceanWorld, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while counting OceanWorld @@CAPITAL@@'s daily intake. "If you ban institutions like OceanWorld, how are endangered species going to survive in this big bad world? Isn't it better that their populations thrive in our viewing tanks, rather than struggling in prime fishing waters? Besides, your average @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ will never get the chance to see these animals except at a zoo. Do you want to deny them that experience?

[[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "Perhaps there could be a compromise?" queries your Minister of Environment, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has been smelling like grass lately. "Ending zoos would harm the tourism industry, and we can't deny that these programs help endangered species. Why don't we set a limit on what animals they take? Specifically the endangered ones? I'm sure that we can also force tougher standards to ensure OceanWorld treats the animals humanely as well."

[b][anchor=548]#548[/anchor]: Appointment Of A Science Advisor [Golgothastan; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
After the government's chief science advisor accidentally disintegrated himself in his latest experiment, you have come under pressure to appoint someone new to the position - but the leading candidates to replace him all have different priorities.

The Debate
1. "Science is critical to understanding our place in the natural world," writes biologist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ in his application letter, which is covered in paw-prints and smells faintly of @@ANIMAL@@ dung. "I believe we need to look more closely at how our actions affect the environment, and if I'm appointed as advisor, I'll make sure the government takes the long term view to ecological preservation - even if that does mean putting a few public works projects and industry partnerships on hold."

[2]. "Now now, you're not going to listen to all that tree-hugging nonsense, are you?" cajoles chemist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, introduced to you at a cocktail party thrown by one of your biggest corporate donors. "The government needs to be partnering up with industry, not making things harder for them. If I'm appointed, I'll make sure the government promotes innovation and invention - and if that means loosening up some of those silly environmental laws, then so be it!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3. "Typical: a new vacancy for a government science advisor opens up, and it immediately becomes a boys' club," sighs physicist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, sporting a rather fetching pink lab coat. "Do you realize that girls outperform boys in science at every grade in school, but that far fewer women end up taking jobs in the sciences than men? Appointing a woman as the nation's science advisor would be a great first step to improving access to the sciences for everyone - and I'd use the position to lobby for universities and research centres to hire more women, too."

4. "Whomever you appoint will just end up leading @@NAME@@ into further damnation!" rants fundamentalist preacher @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ in one of her sermons, replete with typically alarming - and anatomically explicit - descriptions of what this damnation will actually entail. "It's time we purged the government of all its heathen influences, and that includes removing anyone who might go around using words like evolution, or entropy, or evidence!" She breaks off to chase after a group of scientists passing by, waving a pitchfork at them.

The Issue
After a month spent surveying the country and asking adolescents to bend over and touch their toes, researchers from the Healthy Eating Analytical Research Think Tank limped home to nurse some black eyes and calculate their figures. They found that @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ teenagers are among the fattest in the world. Now, as you sit down to a sumptuous seven-course meal and a decent Marche Noirian red, your guests are all keen to opine on the topic.

The Debate
1. "You know what you should do?" says your nephew, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, cramming a slice of peacock-stuffed-ostrich into his mouth. "You should have a big annual games, just like the Ancient Maxtopians did, where gladiators fight to the death with spears. Except this time, the fatties get thrown into the arena. The winners would receive hundreds of thousands of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@," he jumps in his seat excitedly, "A- And t-the losers," a little peacock flies out of his mouth, "would perish like the wimps they are. I bet you anything people will flock to @@CAPITAL@@ to see jumbo mortal combat!"

2. "Why have teens fight with sticks when you can offer them carrots instead?" asks @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the catering assistant who always wanted to be a chef, while wheeling in a cake tray. "Just replace all those nasty sugars and fats with healthy alternatives." She places a meringue beneath your nose, smiling with pleasure as you take a bite, "You'd never guess that meringue's made with stevia, agar gel and chickpea aquafaba egg substitute!" She beams, as you spit the chemical concoction discretely into a napkin, "Just force manufacturers to take all those nasty ingredients out of our food, and our young people will be fitter in no time."

[3]. "Yea, verily we are a nation of gluttons, forgive us," pontificates the Archbishop of @@CAPITAL@@, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, before cracking open his sixth lobster-claw. "If we are to be absolved, we must fast. Make it compulsory that every @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@, children included, fast for forty days every year in accordance with our religious principles... except those of advanced spiritual enlightenment, like us," he adds, out of the corner of his mouth, "That'll trim waistlines and straighten out a few souls too." [Validity: ???]

4. "How 'bout this for an idea?" blurts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, author of popular self-help manual 'Big, Brainy and Beautiful'. "Just butt out. Big is who I am, and big is beautiful. Stop trying to legislate our teens' behinds, and instead promote plus-size beauty for the betterment of our national self-esteem. A little butter never hurt no one; that's what I've always said!"

The Issue
A disturbing new fad has arisen on social media and clickbait sites, featuring linking videos of people suffering violence at the hand of criminals. Muggings, murders, and gang violence are all trending like crazy, and the nation's youthful populace seems to be addicted to online schadenfreude.

The Debate
1. "REPOST THIS TO SHOW YOU CARE!!!" posts popular blogger @@RANDOM_NAME@@, grinning inappropriately while watching a video of a rather savage beating. "Hey, there's nothing wrong with showing the world as it is, especially if it increases the hits on my website. How am I supposed to persuade advertisers to sponsor me unless I have the freedom to publish the most shocking content?"

2. "There's a moral sickness to this nation!" proclaims frocked pastor @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, seen smiling as he flagellates a penitent fellow clergyman with a rubber whip. "We can only remedy this by proper schooling, with properly funded religious authority imprinting a sense of right and wrong from an early age. When we have young people who are more interested in acting right rather than watching wrong, @@NAME@@ will be a better place."

3. TBD

4. "Gahh! I can't even tell what's real and isn't real anymore!" moans your social media handler @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while fighting a losing battle against pop-ups and clickbait sites. "Whatever happened to the good old days of internet journalism, back when they weren't littered with ads... and when ads themselves weren't disguised as news? This sort of practice ought to be banned! The internet needs to return to a place of intellectual discussion and education, not this cesspool of clickbait, gross-out violence, and trolling."

5. "Social media made this problem; let social media fix it," suggests too-reasonable seeming taxi driver @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who considers himself an expert on how @@NAME@@ is run after driving around several politicians. "Tell the big companies behind these sites that they have to police their own sites and enforce better standards, or face financial penalties. They've got huge profit margins, and they pay barely any tax, so let them shoulder the cost of the problems they've created."

During the preparations of your niece's wedding, you publicly announced the government would be paying for the massive and public event, as fulfillment of a promise made to her when she was six years old. A bucketful of economists, a gaggle of giggling advisers, a susurration of confused affiliates, and an infestation of wedding planners are presently debating this matter of 'national importance'... and are forcing you to join in.

The Debate
1. "You promised!" screeches your visibly upset niece who has turned into a bridezilla. "I deserve a proper marriage! By proper, I mean all princess-like and suitable for someone of such affluence! So what if the money for that comes from the treasury? It is a TREASURE-y right? That money should be spent on important occasions, like this one!

3. "This looks like an excellent diplomatic opportunity, @@LEADER@@," muses obnoxious Maxtopian diplomat @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who has been stuffing his face with hors d'oeuvre all day. "The leaders of Maxtopia and Blackacre would love the chance for some civil and peaceful discussion. We're talking about major conflict resolutions and a few trade agreements. This could all be done with a couple simple arranged marriages, as we noticed you have other nieces and nephews at the right age. They may not like marrying into our royalty, but don't you want to be remembered as the leader who helped bring about global peace and stability?"

4. "Nobody asked me whether I wanna pay for this!" exclaims disgruntled baker, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is using a piping bag to write anti-government messages on the cake. "The answer is: I don't! I pay taxes for important things like police, education, and fixing potholes. If you want a wedding, spend your own damn money. Oh wait, I forgot, the people pay your salary.

At last night's press conference in @@CAPITAL@@ you were mooned by three drunk young men. Security has caught them, and they are claiming that this was a 'political protest' against 'government and stuff'. Rather than just throw them in a cell to sleep it off, they're asking if you would like them to deal with the matter in any particular way.

The Debate
*1. "These people should be locked up!" snarls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an angry ex-soldier turned criminal prosecutor. "The fact that they believe that this is acceptable behaviour shows a complete lack of respect of authority! They like showing their butts? Stick them in prison, but issue them no trousers!"

The Issue
Biotech firm McSanto LLC has developed a new genetically engineered corn, with 200% more "butter" flavor and a guarantee to be free of those stringy bits that get stuck in your teeth. They've also engineered every mature kernel to be sterile, while marketing a special starter seed at premium prices. Angry supporters of small farms are demanding you lend an ear.

The Debate
1. "These Frankenfood monstrosities are nothing more than a means for McSanto to drive its competition out of business," complains Maize Zea, founder of Stop Engineering Edibles Darnit! "Engineered sterilization prevents small family and subsistence farmers from saving and reusing seed. This means they have to buy all new and expensive seed for every single crop... and only from McSanto! Do the right thing by abolishing genetically modified organisms and engineered sterilization! Don't let the big biotech firms grind @@NAME@@ into cornmeal!"

2. "Engineered sterilization provides us with the ability to ensure that genetically modified organisms stay targeted to farms and orchards, allowing our precious natural spaces and native species remain unblemished. This way, future generations can prosper from better foods and a greener world," recites Stover Cob, CEO of McSanto LLC, reading from a prepared statement, and setting a gourmet popcorn gift basket on your desk. "Besides, without the ability to draw new agricultural business, McSanto wouldn't be able to recover the millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ it spends on research and development. That means less buttery goodness on the table! Show you have some grits - support agriculture and support McSanto!"

3. While fiddling with a toothpick, Dr. Flint Shoepeg chimes in: "No doubt everyone benefits from the improvements companies like McSanto make to our crops. Those stringy bits really are - OW! - um, really are very annoying. But driving Mom 'n Pop out of business wouldn't be right either. Why don't you discourage engineered sterilization, but support my research in chemical-based genetic rights management?" He retrieves some dental floss from a pocket before continuing: "This way, small farmers can still save seed, but McSanto can require the purchase of an activator spray that will turn their value-added features on. Sure, there's a small risk from runoff, but - OW!"

[b][anchor=554]#554[/anchor]: Welcome To --CENSORED-- [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A small town in Southern @@NAME@@ has a name so offensive that many official cartographers and government officials are refusing to acknowledge it. The debate has thrust --CENSORED-- into the spotlight, and many concerned citizens are asking the government to step in.

The Debate
1. "Well, I never!" gasps your easily offended Minister of Municipalities, dropping her monocle in surprise, directly into her champagne. "How this town ended up with such a dreadfully appalling name is beyond me. For all that is good and decent in @@REGION@@, I must ask you to change this town's name. Something functional and sensible like 'Pleasant-town' or 'Stepfjord' would have a much better ring to it. Then they can learn to behave like proper, civilised people."

2. "Now wait just a **** chicken *****ing minute!" exclaims @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ '****hand' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, the eccentric mayor of --CENSORED--. "The residents of our fine town are ****** happy with our name just the way it ****ing is! Our name is part of our heritage and you can't go around changing it just because some do-gooders find it offensive! We'll be keeping our name thank you very *******ing much and you prudes can **** right out of our ********ing business."

3. "Is plenty clear we need to reach a compromise, ya ken?" suggests @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ MacDiarmid, a noted devolutionist who attends every public debate possible. "Seems like majority dinnae want that name appearin' on official maps and websites and suchlike, but guv-ment choosin' a spankin' noo name seems a wee bit too bossy, if yer see what I'm sayin' in the noo. Why not have yer provincial votes on yer town nomenclature like? Have any petition with a dram of signatures be triggerin' a referendum: then all the people can decide how settlements are named, y'ken? Granted there, there may be a-one or a-two grumpy locals fashin' themselves like wee bairns aboot it, but as me gran-da used to say, ye cannae please all of the people all of the time."

[b][anchor=555]#555[/anchor]: It's An Honor Just To Be Nominated! [Omigodtheykilledkenny; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Since the news broke that corrupt party boss Tommy Kneehall allegedly used his influence and cash to secure nominations to Parliament for more than a dozen of his closest friends, including both his wife and his favorite mistress, voters have been clamoring for a more open and transparent process to determine which candidates parties nominate for office.

The Debate
1. "What a clustershag," despairs powerless opposition backbencher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who somehow managed to sneak into your meeting. "I mean, even I have to admit, that mistress has a nice pair of 'assets' on her, but are they really qualifications for public office? This demonstrates more than ever the need to take power away from the establishment and the big donors and put it in the hands of the constituents. Let the parties hold open preliminary votes to decide who the nominees for office are. It's fair, it's transparent, it's democratic, and sure, parties may be stuck with a complete basketcase who doesn't know his behind from his elbow, but if it's what the people want, how could anyone possibly object?"

2. "That's a good start, but we have to make sure that voting is limited to members of our Party only," replies @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a small town mayor who has jumped ship to national politics. "If we open things up to everyone, the Opposition could sneak in and plant their own candidates. Remember that blowhard nominee who turned out to be an East Lebatukese spy a few elections back? That was an embarrassment I think we'd all want to avoid again. It may mean losing the swing voters and independents, but we can't let anyone walk in and claim they uphold our values without being properly vetted."

3. "Don't be tempted by populism," warns a shadowy political advisor, speaking from a dark corner while closing the blinds in your office. "Primary elections are costly, they encourage a lot of unproductive infighting, and, frankly, they take too much power away from @@CAPITAL@@. There is a much simpler way to make nominations less corrupt, and that's to make sure every candidate who runs goes through a rigorous ideological purity test. That way the most loyal, and therefore most qualified, candidates are the ones nominated."

4. "I've got a much more classy idea!" declares @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ mogul @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while ogling all your interns. "Why waste our time with votes or vetoes, when we can force all candidates, even the men, to compete in a beauty pageant! It'll be a fabulous show, everyone will love it. Just imagine, a leading candidate breezes through the talent and interview portions, but gets blown away in the swimsuit competition! I know I'd want to watch! The best part is that it won't cost you a single @@CURRENCY@@! Just let me throw in a few ads for my company and products, and I'll pay for everything!"

[b][anchor=556]#556[/anchor]: Here Be Dragons? [Golgothastan; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The discovery of an ancient map that says "Here Be Dragons" at an archaeological dig close to @@CAPITAL@@ has generated a storm of public interest, and a disturbingly high percentage of the population has indicated on a survey that they actually believe dragons exist.

The Debate
*1. "Do we really have to go through this again?" sighs Education Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while reading through a woefully inaccurate high school history textbook. "The map was obviously just talking about lizards or something. Dragons aren't real! If the people really are this credulous, then it's just a sign that we need to give the education budget another boost. If you need the funding, you can take it from that religious ministry. It's that superstitious mumbo-jumbo that has people believing in imaginary creatures anyway." [color=purple]Must not ban religions? TBC.[/color]

*2. "Do we really have to go through this again?" sighs Education Minister Rosita Egan, while reading through a woefully inaccurate high school history textbook. "The map was obviously just talking about lizards or something. Dragons aren't real! If the people really are this credulous, then it's just a sign that we need to give the education budget another boost. If you need the funding, I bet there are some illegal religious practitioners whose assets you can seize. It's that superstitious mumbo-jumbo that has people believing in imaginary creatures anyway." [color=purple]Must ban religions? TBC.[/color]

[3]. "It most certainly does not!" protests Religious Affairs Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Do you really think our sacred books are full of seven-headed ten-crowned dragons? If you want to find someone to blame, the fault is clearly with those godless fantasy authors and television producers, filling our young people's heads with rubbish and anti-religious propaganda. We must censor works like that hedonistic Play of Crowns series so they can't corrupt our children!" [[color=purple]Must have at least 5.0 prayers / hour (Religiousness)?[/color]]

4. "Okay, so dragons don't exist... yet," agrees Minister of Science and Technology @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while poking a strange-looking animal with a cattle prod. "Although with recent advances in biological splicing, who knows? If you allotted a little extra in the budget for science, and eased up on some of those research restrictions, we could start creating all sorts of creatures in our labs. Maybe we could even try a field test of Prototype #42?"

5. "I'm not sure there's anything actually wrong with the public believing dragons exist," muses Minister of Whispers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while feeding a flock of little birds. "If you ask me, they've been getting a little uppity lately. Remember that protest last week, simply because you wanted to erect your statue in @@CAPITAL@@ Square? Let's start spreading rumours that you really do have dragons - a whole flight of them! They'll think twice about speaking out over the new tax bill then! Fire and blood!"

[b][anchor=557]#557[/anchor]: Take A Hike! [A Humanist Science; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
While you were conducting an operational inspection of a new @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ National Guard search and rescue helicopter, dispatch received a distress signal from a Personal Locator Beacon, a GPS-enhanced device wilderness adventurers use to request life-saving help. The helicopter immediately raced to the scene, setting down in a remote sun-baked meadow. Unfortunately, the distressed hiker refused rescue, saying "my stubbed toe is feeling better now."

The Debate
1. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a National Guard rescue operative, is exasperated. "This situation is intolerable, @@LEADER@@! In a genuine emergency, these beacons save lives. Now that they're so cheap, more and more people are using them as a crutch to attempt dangerous hikes they aren't prepared for. As you can see, we have to carry the huge risks and costs! Beacon users should have to register with the government, so we know who to fine for false alarms."

2. The helicopter crew patches an incoming call through to your headset. "Hello?" asks famed luxury safari hunter Beauregard Leopold Addington III, Esq. "You know, my friend's business makes satellite phones that can allow rescuers to contact hikers and assess the situation before calling out the cavalry. Sure, the service subscriptions are pricey, and your signa**SSHBZZZTPSSHFTZZPFT**ways get through, but mandatory sat-phones for hikers will reduce false alarms and are great for checking your stock portfolio from any summit!"

3. By this point, you've been standing in the sun for a while, and a mild heat stroke is setting in. Wait - is that bear wearing a tie? "You know, expensive fines and equipment will only discourage people seeking help when they really need it," says the bear while munching a stolen packet of Honey Burr-Berry cereal. "That'll cost lives too. The better solution is to increase funding to national parks, with safe trails, visitor centers, and campsites. Then the common @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ can enjoy @@NAME@@'s natural wonder without the corporations getting their grubby hands on it. It's smarter than the average policy!"

[b][anchor=558]#558[/anchor]: Turning A Blind Eye? [The Aurora Archipelago; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
When a blind man and his guide @@ANIMAL@@ were recently refused service in @@CAPITAL@@ restaurant 'The Haute Potato', it started a heated debate that few had seen coming.

The Debate
1. "This is a real eye-opener!" exclaims Mathias Murdock, head of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Blind Trust, speaking to a large group of cane-wielding protesters. "This discrimination against the blind and partially-sighted has gone on for too long. Not only should we be allowed to take our companions and guardians wherever we go, now is the time to realize our vision of a society completely accessible for the visually impaired!"

2. "@@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ must be kept out of restaurants; why can't these people see that?" queries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a young chef from 'The Haute Potato', reeking of paprika. "It's not that I don't understand, really, I do, but it's a health issue, you know. Imagine that thing entering the kitchen; you'd get their fur or scales or whathaveyou all over the buffet," she asserts confidently while her sweat trickles down into tonight's babaganuche. "He should just tie his @@ANIMAL@@ outside along with any other mutt. They still have their canes, don't they?"

3. Your @@ANIMAL@@-walker, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has 20/20 vision, rambles at you whilst untangling several leads. "Why are we only thinking of the blind here? I can't see why the blind should be able take their @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ into restaurants, while my poor babies still have to be tied out in the rain. You'll let me take my @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ into restaurants as well, right?"

[b][anchor=559]#559[/anchor]: The Low Aspiration Nation [The New Bluestocking Homeland; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
High unemployment is ravaging @@NAME@@. A recent career fair in @@CAPITAL@@ consisted of a tumbleweed rolling through empty booths, and the @@NAME@@ Career Shopper is only two pages long and stuffed with ads for pizza parlors and discreet massages. They're just not hiring. In an attempt to get your economy jumping again, a trio of self-professed experts have come forward to proffer advice.

The Debate
1. "The problem is lack of opportunity," says @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, who so far has been unable to use her underwater basket weaving degree. "The government needs to guarantee that every young person can get a job, maybe to build parks or repairs bridges or design specialty baskets. That's the only permanent way to get @@NAME@@ working again."

2. "What?! Excuse me?" rages industrialist Richard Noseworthy III, nearly knocking over his bikini-clad daughter, who is uploading a pouting selfie to Rich Kids of Instasnap. "The problem isn't lack of opportunity; the problem is greed! The working man is just too greedy! If you scrapped those pesky labor laws, I could employ twice the number of people for the same amount of money, if I so felt like it."

3. "That's an interesting idea, but does it go far enough?" muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while gazing nostalgically at a dilapidated sugar plantation. "There used to be a time when workers and managers didn't have a hostile relationship. Master and chattel worked together to bring prosperity to the land. Slaves served their drivers out of love, and masters provided their slaves with everything they needed, treating them just like their own children. Implementing slavery would bring harmony to the labor process, and it would guarantee job security too."
