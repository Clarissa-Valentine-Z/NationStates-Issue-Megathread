[b][anchor=400]#400[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Insurgents Resurgence [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
With Brasilistan's military weakened, you sent in some commandos to assassinate the leaders of the armed forces.

The Issue
Your elite commando units have managed to take out the command structure of the Brasilistan military, but its remnants are continuing to attack your troops present in the country. With public opinion beginning to turn, your advisers once again gather to discuss the situation.

The Debate
1. "We've gone this far, why not take it a step further", your Minister for Domestic Affairs says quietly. "Send in the rest of our armed forces to mop up, and then when they're done, encourage our own citizens to move there on a permanent basis. I'm talking colonisation here, yes, so it will be a long, drawn-out process, but we've invested so much already that it'd be folly not to follow through."

2. "Colonisation is expensive and right now it's unnecessary", General @@RANDOMNAME@@ booms around the room. "But we shouldn't let them get away with hurting our boys over there. I don't know how y'all are feeling about this campaign but it's beginning to get on my back teeth and I'm getting sick and tired of these damned insurgents upsetting our every plan. We should just find them and kill them, and if we can't find them, kill anyone remotely connected to them. That'll teach 'em."

3. "Ah who cares about Brasilistan really", your National Security Advisor exclaims exasperatedly, throwing a pen across the desk. "I don't. It's causing us far much trouble, more than it's worth actually, and it's going to bankrupt us if we continue – and that's before we even think about colonisation. And even if we back out now, in a few years they'll retaliate once they've built up their strength. Let's nip this in the bud. Nuke them."

[b][anchor=401]#401[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: What's The WA Gonna Do, Anyway? [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Your government's response to Brasilistan holding @@DENOMYM@@ citizens hostage was to bomb the living daylights out of cities with heavy population densities. When questioned about this by other nations around the world, your decision was to call their bluff and continue in your bombing campaign.

The Issue
The relentess bombing of civilian centres in Brasilistan is causing mass casualties of innocents. International pressure is building as even allies of @@NAME@@ are now beginning to question the excessive force being levied upon non-combatants, insurgents, and enemy prisoners of war.

The Debate
1. "Ignore them, this is our war", Military Chief of Staff Dwight Powell snarls. "There are no innocent civilians in Brasilistan, they're all doing something to subvert our authority. We need to step up our game against these darned insurgents – show no mercy! No more taking prisoners of war either – kill them if they even so much as look at a weapon!"

2. "Now there's an idea..." @@RANDOMNAME@@, the head of your protection service muses aloud. "And he's got a point too; they are all really insurgents, even if they're not taking arms against our boys. How about we stick it to the international community by rounding up some villagers and 'take care of them' right there on live television. And when other governments complain, which they will, we can doctor up some intelligence, say they were commanders of the insurgents, and that the live execution was a message - we're not playing anymore."

3. "Just nuke them", Captain @@RANDOMNAME@@, your aide-de-camp, says in a passive tone. "We are a sovereign country, we make our own decisions. This is not their business, and this is not their war. If they criticise us, or try to use that World Assembly to do anything about it, nuke them. Just nuke any country that dares speak out. We have tons of nukes and we only need one per country, after all."

[b][anchor=402]#402[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: They Surrendered... Now What? [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
In order to fight back against Brasilistani insurgents, rebels, and guerrilla warfare, you laid down harsh justice and declared a regime of no tolerance, with instant death as a penalty.

The Issue
Military intelligence is reporting that a sizeable number of the insurgent forces have surrendered after a particularly brutal battle. Your advisors have gathered around you once more to discuss the developing situation.

The Debate
1. "This is great news", your Foreign Secretary Hillary Smoochinger says with a smile. "We can finally end this drawn-out conflict in Brasilistan once and for all if we accept their surrender. This is the vast majority of the native armed forces, but there'll still be pockets of armed resistance left and doubtlessly some horrid guerilla warfare. If we accept this surrender and treat the imprisoned survivors well enough, I think the remnants may be convinced to law down their arms."

2. "No. Absolutely not!" barks the operation commander from over your right shoulder. "Let's just deal with this and finish the job. Keeping these rogues alive would compromise the security of Brasilistan and the lives of our men on the ground. We should just kill them and set an example – do not mess with @@NAME@@. We'd best kill their families too so there's no retaliation. Just to be sure."

3. "I agree, finish the job", says your Science Minister. "And I have just the idea to do so – nuke them! I mean, look, we've wanted to test out our weapons for a while now, and the insurgents are all gathered in one place. Yes, we'll get some of our own men, and yes it'll destroy Brasilistan, and yes it will make people mad at us, but think of the greater good!"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b][anchor=403]#403[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: We Done Killing Yet? [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Your counterinsurgency has been killing rebels on sight - along with their family, friends, and local postmen.

The Issue
With the vast majority of Brasilistani insurgents dead, there is no longer any threat to @@NAME@@'s soldiers in the nation. Questions now arise with what you should to with the war-torn state and its beleaguered and weary remaining citizens.

The Debate
1. "We should probably round up a whole boatload of our own citizens and ship them over to settle the place", your Minister for Labour @@RANDOMNAME@@ says eagerly. "I suggest the unemployed. We could send them over, have them occupy the territory for us, and then lay the groundwork for a new, more stable nation. And if individual Brasilistani disagree? Well we'll give our settlers some weapons and let them sort out disagreements."

2. "Aha! Ha-ha-ha", your Chief Science Officer Professor Maxx von Strangehate cackles. "Occupy! What a silly goat you are! No, leader, what we should do is use Brasilistan as a nuclear testing site. Think of it! We'd get rid of all our problems in one easy go, and prove to the world at large how powerful we are! It's not as expensive as occupation and there'll be no gas bill at the end of it either. We already have the weapons, all we need is your say-so!"

[b][anchor=404]#404[/anchor]: 404 Issue Not Found [Sedgistan; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
Upon arriving at your desk early this morning, you were stunned to find there weren't any dilemmas to resolve.

The Debate
1. "Well it's not surprising, it is?" pipes up @@RANDOMNAME@@ from your entourage. "Every day, you expect the people of @@NAME@@ to come to you with their problems. Would it hurt you, for once, to go out and ask them what they want you to do?"

2. "They've given up!" grumbles @@RANDOMNAME@@, ever the pessimist, "and I don't blame them. All these decisions, made with the best of intentions, and they always go wrong. From tax code reform to that incident with Brasilistan, nothing ever goes quite the way it should. Just give up, and let someone else call the shots for once."

3. "Nonsense!" trills the annoyingly chirpy @@RANDOMNAME@@, pirouetting around your office. "There's just nothing left to fix. Yes, @@LEADER@@, that's right. It's perfect. @@NAME@@, @@DEMONYM@@, you. All perfect."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b][anchor=405]#405[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Time For A Colonyoscopy! [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
The problems in Brasilistan were mounting daily. So, when push came to shove, an advisor told you to just take it over. And you did.

The Issue
The dust has settled and, somehow, @@NAME@@ is now the proud owner of a new colony! There are still some teething issues, however, and there are some cultural and societal conflicts between settlers and native peoples. It's up to you on how best to resolve these issues.

The Debate
1. "Obviously we need to remove the settlers", @@RANDOMNAME@@, Chairperson of the @@NAME@@ Council of Immigration Studies says frankly. "Pulling out completely and leaving the remaining populace to their own devices, however, would be detrimental and irresponsible. Ideally what needs to be done is to make Brasilistan a full part of @@NAME@@, and give the remaining Brasilistanis full citizenship. We'd all be part of the same country, with the same citizenship, and the same rights and responsibilities."

2. "Woah, hold on there, that's way too drastic, and way too fast", your Interior Minister chuckles. "That's not going to solve the issues they're facing today over there right now. We need to come up with some sort of initiative that slowly integrates the Brasilistanis into our culture. You should appoint panels of arbiters consisting of international experts to broker agreements between settlers and natives where necessary too. It'll work, definitely. Probably."

3. "It's our land now", your energy advisor says quietly. "It's ours. Our own. Our precious. Eh, where was I … oh yes, Brasilistan. Look, there's not that many Brasilistani left, let's just give them the useless pockets of land. Like those on mountain slopes or in bogland. All oil-rich and arable lands can be kept for ourselves. Sure, it's a little like segregation, but at least everyone will be happy, right?"

4. "All these options are valid, to be sure, but I have an easier way of settling this", @@RANDOMNAME@@, head of the nation's nuclear program says in a matter-of-fact tone. "Can we please just nuke the place? Get our own guys out first, obviously but then just nuke it. We don't need a colony, but we do need a nuclear testing site. Our own citizens here are getting annoyed we're destroying good land in @@NAME@@ when there's a perfectly good dump in the form of Brasilistan."

[b][anchor=406]#406[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: It's The Final Countdown [Sanctaria; ed: Maxtopia][/b]

The Story So Far
You have decided that the only sensible response to the crisis in Brasilistan is a nuclear one.

The Issue
@@NAME@@'s nuclear missiles stand ready. You know the risks. You've weighed the options. But the @@NAMEINITIALS@@SA requires your final approval before launching a nuclear strike on Brasilistan.

The Debate
1."There is nothing left to discuss," says General @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, his voice echoing strangely loudly in the crowded war room. "The way forward is clear. Indeed, it is the only choice remaining. We are locked into this course of action. There's no actual decision to be made at all. So go ahead. Press the button. There's no stopping it now."

[b][anchor=407]#407[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Brasilistan Go Boom [Maxtopia; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
You decided to deal with the crisis in Brasilistan by launching a wave of nuclear strikes.

The Issue
When you give the order to launch the nukes, your general briefly leaves the room. The moments tick by. When he returns, he simply nods once. "Birds in the air." There are almost two dozen people around this table, including some of the most brilliant minds and fearsome personalities in @@NAME@@, but none of them speak. "Three minutes until impact." You expected more activity. But there's nothing to do. There aren't even any gigantic computer screens, tracing the path of the missiles. It's beneath you, you suppose. Your job is not to track the flight of missiles. Your job is simply to decide. And that's what you've done. You've decided to annihilate another country. You look around the table at your advisors and soldiers. Some nod back at you reassuringly. Some won't meet your eyes. Not everyone will agree with you, of course. But it's not their decision. It's yours. The general leaves the room several more times. Finally, he returns. "It's done," your general says. "It's done."

[b][anchor=408]#408[/anchor]: [color=goldenrod]Easter Egg[/color]: Pony Peril [Sedgelight Sparkle; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
A revolution in Maxtopia in which the state was take over by brightly coloured, anthropomorphic magical ponies, has made the government aware of the threat posed by ponyists in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "It's clear what we must do" bellows @@RANDOMNAME@@, four star General in the @@NAME@@ Armed Forces. "These creatures, cute though they are, would seek to undermine our way of life, and threaten our very existence. This infestation cannot continue! We must round up all the ponies in @@NAME@@, execute them, and leave their carcasses to the crows."

2. "What a waste" interjects adhesives magnate @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, rubbing his hands with glee. "These ponies are one of the great resources of @@NAME@@. It's simple. Just slaughter them, dismember their corpses, and boil them down into glue. Our industry will be the envy of @@REGION@@."

3. "Don't you think they're both overreacting?" asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, owner of @@DEMONYM@@ Salt Co. "These ponies are dangerous, but we must show some compassion when dealing with them. Instead of killing them, do the humane thing and force them into slavery. In fact, why not make it compulsory for @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ to travel everywhere by pony?"

4. Psychiatrist @@RANDOMNAME@@ implores you to see sense. "These poor creatures aren't actual ponies. They're misguided, delusional humans, wearing silly costumes. We must help them. A dose of electrotherapy should fix their warped minds, and any deviants who aren't cured can be lobotomised."

[b][anchor=409]#409[/anchor]: Water Palaver [Eremora; ed: Lenyo and Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The last remaining health advocates in @@NAME@@ have approached your office with a list of grievances about the “special additives” your government has placed in the water supply.

The Debate
1. An aging punk rocker with faded tattoos of X’s on her hands argues, “The government adding chemicals to the water was a terrible idea. Forcing us all to drink these things against our will; that’s a breach of bodily autonomy. People should be allowed, at least, to choose to opt-out of this harebrained program. Sure, providing PURE bottled drinking water to the citizens who want it would increase taxes, but think of all the jobs it would create! With clean hydration, our nation could accomplish so much more.”

2. “Duuuuuude, we didn’t go far enough,” wheezes @@RANDOMNAME@@, creeping into your office from an open window. “It was a great idea to put chems in the water, and it’d be an even greater idea to get some feel-good drugs into the cocktail. Everybody must get stoned, man; it’s like that song. Now, it is a shame and an outrage, dear leader, that users of certain socially stigmatized drugs continue to be left out in the cold. It isn’t fair that people who like to drink the tap water get it for free, while I have to spend my hard-earned @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ importing rare diamondback licking-toads. The government should add more highs to the supply, man! Subsidize recreational drug use!”

3. “So many voices. So many opinions. So many options...” intones your sinister intern, @@RANDOMNAME@@, shrouded in kretek smoke. “Some people need drugs to keep them calm and supporting our party. Others need drugs to feel good when they inevitably get stuck in miserable, pointless, dead-end jobs. Others, still, might benefit from drugs that help them go berserk on the battlefield. Naturally, government officials such as myself would benefit greatly from enforcing, shall we say, selective sobriety. Best of all, we could harness the power of addiction! People would have to listen to us - or else!”

4. “That sounds... downright frightening,” shudders @@RANDOMNAME@@, your medical advisor. “If I may be honest, I think we went too far when we laced the public water supply. I’m not saying we should ban anything, but we really shouldn’t force anyone to ingest these substances. People shouldn’t have to collect rainwater if they just want a refreshing drink.”

[b][anchor=410]#410[/anchor]: 12 Angry, Tired, and Increasingly Confused Men [Golgothastan; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
The trial of one of @@NAME@@'s most notorious embezzlers has ended after eight years with a "Not Guilty" verdict, despite most legal experts considering the evidence overwhelming. Some have suggested that trial by jury should be abolished for certain complex financial crimes.

The Debate
1. "Eight years wasted on that crook all because the jury couldn't keep up with the technical terms involved!" rants exasperated state prosecutor @@RANDOMNAME@@, stuffing papers into a briefcase after the trial. "I'm not saying we should do away with trial by jury altogether, but for cases like these, which involve a great deal of expertise to even understand the laws in the first place - corruption, fraud, insider trading - there's simply no benefit in depending on a group of uninformed citizens to come up with a verdict." 

2. "Why are we so hung up on trial by jury anyway?" shrugs the author of the controversial bestseller Leviathan: The Matter, Form and Power of @@LEADER@@'s Mother-in-Law. "When you go to the doctor, do you depend on twelve random strangers for your diagnosis? Of course not. Democratic principles have their practical limits: we mustn't entrust the courts to dull-witted jurors who don't understand basic concepts such as reasonable doubt."

3. "Ooh, and what else do you expect me to do, luvvie?" clucks @@NAME@@'s most prolific juror, @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@ as she rolls up a copy of this week's Alright! magazine. "You know, I wouldn't mind deciding on parking disputes, especially if I get to chat with Rita from the Milton murder trial again. Did you hear she's had her hair done again - oh, where was I? Oh right, well this 'pyramid scheme' thing might've given me a headache, but at least it got me out the house."

[b][anchor=411]#411[/anchor]: Outed Teacher Ousted [Roulantina; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A religious high school in @@CAPITAL@@ has caused quite a stir after firing a teacher because of his homosexual orientation.

The Debate
*1. "I can't see what they did wrong," says @@RANDOMNAME@@, proud parent and founder of the Holier Than Thou prayer group. "Homosexuality is an apostasy onto everything we stand for and believe in! I don't want my children to be exposed to it. Teachers are role models for their students for heaven's sake. I say all sodomites should be banned from teaching at all schools in @@NAME@@, lest the contagion spread." [[color=blue]Must not have corporal punishment[/color]]

2. "Prohibiting people from doing their jobs just because of their love life is utterly ridiculous!" shouts a mad-as-hell civil rights activist, "Don't we live in modern society? Giving these fundamentalist idiots what they want is a huge violation of human rights. All people should be able to do their jobs, whatever their sexuality!"

3. “This is yet another example of what harm religion does to our society,” says LGBTQ activist @@RANDOMNAME@@, waving a rainbow flag. “Homosexuality shouldn’t be a taboo subject anymore. Children ought to be brought up knowing that sexual diversity is just something that exists in society and is completely normal. To help society move forward, we need to get rid of religious schooling and teach that people should love whoever and whatever they want.”

*4. "I can't see what they did wrong," says @@RANDOMNAME@@, proud parent and founder of the Holier Than Thou prayer group. "Homosexuality is an apostasy onto everything we stand for and believe in! I don't want my children to be exposed to it. Teachers are role models for their students for heaven's sake. I say all sodomites should be flogged publicly for their crimes, lest the contagion spread." [[color=red]Must have corporal punishment[/color]]

[b][anchor=412]#412[/anchor]: The Magic (Of Advertising!) School Bus [Teh Fluffles; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
An educational budget shortfall has prompted several local school districts to allow companies to advertise on school buses. This, of course, has aroused a major controversy over the ubiquity of advertisement.

The Debate
1. "I would like to let you know that I have a problem with this," states high-school social studies teacher @@RANDOMNAME@@, "I teach my students all the time about the negative effects of advertising on the populace, and then at the end of the day, they leave on buses inundated with this very corporate propaganda! It must be outlawed! And since we're so strapped for cash, have the rich pay up for once."

2. "Corporate propaganda?" exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, CEO of Omni Consumer Products, "You've got to be kidding me! This is all harmless, you see. The advertising on buses is great for the school systems. How else would girls know that Maxxxi brand pads are right for them? Now, if you just sign here, businesses will be able to cover the buses with signs - to support education, of course - and perhaps we can advertise all over the schools themselves, too."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b][anchor=413]#413[/anchor]: A Shot in the Arm [Nation of Quebec; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
The dreaded Rubellan Measles has made a sudden comeback in @@NAME@@. The disease, which once killed millions, was thought to be wiped out after a vaccine was discovered fifty years ago. Medical professionals blame a recent anti-vaccination movement, which has turned immunization into a political football.

The Debate
1. "I'm not going to allow my babies to become slaves to Big Pharma!" bemoans parent and prominent anti-vaxxer @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Did you know that vaccines can cause autism and stunt a child's development? I can show you several studies that say so! These pharmaceutical companies are even putting nanobots in their vaccines! Nanobots! It is the right of every parent to determine what is best for their children."

2. "Please. Those so-called studies are nothing but hokum," counters your physician, Doctor @@RANDOMNAME@@, while checking your heartbeat with a stethoscope. "Vaccines save lives every single day. If it weren't for vaccines, Rubellan Measles would have killed off half of @@NAME@@'s population by now! There is absolutely no correlation between autism and vaccinations. Any scientist or doctor worth their degree will tell you that. If anything, we should make vaccinations mandatory for the health and well-being of @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ across the nation." The doctor snaps on a rubber glove. "Now, let's hurry this up. Cough, please."

[3]. "I agree, but we also need to send a message to these awful anti-vaxxer parents," states child psychologist @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Not only are these parents putting their children in danger by refusing to vaccinate them, they are putting all of society in danger. Do you really want to have an outbreak of Rubellan Measles in @@NAME@@s schools and daycares? I didn't think so. I recommend giving these parents a short jail sentence and banning their children from education until they're vaccinated. Sure, some people will complain about this being a violation of their rights as parents, but surely the health and safety of children trumps those concerns?" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

4. "You know, we wouldn't have these problems if the population was more scientifically aware," muses amateur scientist @@RANDOMNAME@@ while pouring a vial of green liquid into a vial of purple liquid. "Movements like these are bred from ignorance and misinformation. If the government took an active role in promoting science and education this problem would go away. You could invest in real scientific studies and programs, make science classes mandatory in schools, and arrest any religious nuts who attempt to disrupt our work. @@NAME@@ would enter a new Golden Age!" The vials of liquid suddenly explode, covering your office with smoke and an unusually colored foam.

[b][anchor=414]#414[/anchor]: Subpar Suburbs [Luna Amore; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
A water main burst in a suburb of @@CAPITAL@@. After months of inaction, the pool of standing water has turned the now largely abandoned commercial district into a watering hole for local wildlife. Local businesses have come to you demanding change.

The Debate
1. "If the state of our town proves one thing, it's that the government is completely incapable of running it properly," argues cycling enthusiast and owner of the local bike shop Gone With The Schwinn, @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Government priorities shift with each election cycle making it impossible for any real growth to happen. We need to privatize the local government if this town is going to run a profit again. Companies can bid for control of everything, from garbage collection to city hall!"

2. "You want to do what?" protests @@RANDOMNAME@@, Mayor of the city. "A town is more than its profit margin, @@LEADER@@. Sure, we've seen better days, but it's because our budget has been hacked away year after year. If the government would invest in our fair town instead of throwing it to the wolves, we'd be back on track in no time."

3. "These plans, they have no charm, no wonder!" announces Elias Yensid strolling into the room with an elaborate model city. "I present to you the Exploratory Paradigm City of Tomorrow! What my team and I aim to do is transform this rundown one-horse town into the forefront of science, technology, and international togetherness. Maybe we'll even throw in a roller coaster or two. Think of it as a blueprint for the future! With me in full control of course."

4. "Every one of these plans conveniently forgets about the animals," chastises the head barista from Bean Me Up Coffee. "Y'all saunter in here after mother nature has made the best of a bad situation. That watering hole is crucial to the local wildlife, and it simply isn't fair to take that away from the bunnies and deer and the cute little birds. Let's take whatever money we were going to waste on rebuilding this failing town and turn it into a nature reserve."

[b][anchor=415]#415[/anchor]: Brain Pain On The Sports Plain [Have fun with it; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
@@ANIMAL@@ball - a sport that is extremely popular in @@NAME@@ but not so much anywhere else - is causing a slew of concussions in @@DEMONYMADJETIVE@@ schools. Brain trauma from the head-on collisions is causing cognitive problems and - on occasion - deaths.

The Debate
1. "You have to stop this madness!" yells @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, the mother of an eighthback for @@CAPITAL@@ High School. "My son has received so many concussions that his grades are dropping. To hell with tradition, our children's fragile brains are more important!"

*2. "Come on, @@LEADER@@. You're not actually thinking about this, are you?" says @@RANDOMNAME@@, PR rep from the @@CAPITAL@@ Wyverns, a professional @@ANIMAL@@ball team. "I know it's tough, but without @@ANIMAL@@ball in the schools, who will be the great pro athletes of the future?

[b][anchor=416]#416[/anchor]: Prophet Margins [Luna Amore; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A recent national survey found that 40% of @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ regularly consult fortune tellers.

The Debate
1. "These 'fortune tellers' are nothing more than scam artists!" cries @@RANDOMMALENAME@@ from his soapbox, "This is clear-cut fraud and should be punished as such. They can't see into the future! No one can! We need to lock up these crystal-ball reading hacks for the good of @@NAME@@!"

2. "Banning these fortune tellers only treats the symptom, not the disease, " states your Minister of Education, @@RANDOMNAME@@, "If our people are dumb enough to believe this hokum, then we've got a serious education problem. Clearly we need to increase our school budget and start an outreach program to stamp this problem out at the source. It'll require more taxes, but the people need our help."

3. "I foresee a great eeeeeeeee-vil if you listen to these advisors," moans Mystic Meg, a prominent fortune teller clad in bangles. "You are in great danger, @@LEADER@@. GRAVE DANGER! You must ignore these naysayers, for they will certainly lead to your downfall! Obviously the government needs its own oracles to foresee catastrophe and guide us through troubled times."

4. "Consider the opportunity this presents, @@LEADER@@," says your chief counselor as he steps from behind the arras, "Almost half of the population believes this hoopla. We must encourage this new faith as much as possible.

[b][anchor=417]#417[/anchor]: Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte [Junkula; ed: Lenyo & Ransium][/b]

The Issue
Your personal assistant, Charlotte Sweet, has threatened to tell the newspapers that you had an affair with her unless you give her lots of money.

The Debate
1. "Even if you never went near her, we can't let this story get out," says your Chief of Staff. "Think of the scandal! No, no, no. Pay her. Pay the tabloids. Pay anyone who's ever heard the word affair! Pay them as much as it takes to make this disappear. Sure, this might be a quick and dirty solution, but sometimes you have to put your career first."

2. "We just have to make sure she doesn't win over the public with her deceptions," counsels your attorney, @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Force all the newspapers to expose her as a liar. Release statements saying you stand by your family. Drastic measures must be taken to ensure media truth! Now let's prep your testimony. Repeat after me: I did not have an affair with that woman."

3. "Maybe this little problem really isn't a dilemma," opines your press advisor, @@RANDOMNAME@@. "We live in modern times, and I don't think the public care about who sleeps with whom. You're better off seizing the initiative and telling the world about every relationship you've had in a series of memoirs. Make it juicy enough to be exciting, and at the very least people will say you're honest. People don't say that a whole lot about politicians these days."

[b][anchor=418]#418[/anchor]: That Sinking Feeling [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Hundreds of lives were lost, and millions of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ squandered, in the recent sinking of the passenger ship RMS Gargantic. While the cause of the disaster has not yet been ascertained, it has been uncovered that the emergency services somehow completely failed to come to the rescue, exacerbating the death toll.

The Debate
1. “What a tragedy!” cries @@RANDOMNAME@@ at the grave of a victim of the accident, “It's clear that we must take drastic action to make sure this never happens again!" After blowing her nose, she continues, "We must put much more funding into the Coast Guard, light houses, communications equipment, our ports, round-the-clock submarine patrols... heck we should even have cameras on trained fish if it'll help. Damn the expense; lives are at stake!"

2. "What a tragedy!” cries your finance minister as he obsessively goes over budget accounts, “Look how many Shiny Things this debacle cost us! We can't even blame it on those pesky opposition activists this time either! Obviously the Coast Guard needs to take full responsibility for this disaster, because clearly they can't get the job done under pressure. All they really do is harass tourists anyway. We should abolish the wasteful department and then cut the tax rate as an apology to the public.”

3. “Blub-blub-blub,” says diving enthusiast @@RANDOMNAME@@ just before climbing out of the water, "Sorry, but have you seen the wreck down there? The Gargantic is so amazing! And all those skeletons really give the place that spooky, old-timey feel. We should totally advertise these sea-wrecks. Imagine the benefit to the economy. This could be: 'You've seen it in the headlines... now come see it for yourself!' The government could even post weekly updates on where the latest wrecks are."

The Issue
A group of very excited scientists has requested funding for a new space mission to land the Rapid Empyrean Delivery (RED) Rover on a passing comet.

The Debate
1. "It will be more than thirty-five years before we'll have another opportunity like this!" exclaims RED Project Leader, @@RANDOMNAME@@, nearly bursting with excitement. "Remember, no other nation has attempted a comet landing, so @@NAME@@ has the opportunity to add all kinds of discoveries to the body of scientific knowledge. Admittedly there's no guarantee that the RED Rover will successfully land, but I'm sure we'll work out all the technical details."

2. "There's a reason that other nations aren't blowing government money on worthless scientific projects," rants your military advisor, @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Wasting billions to put a remote control toy on a giant ball of ice in space isn't going to prove anything. What our nation needs is the respect - and by respect I mean fear - of other nations. Let's take out that meteor as a demonstration to the world of our martial prowess."

3. A frantic-looking citizen with a tinfoil hat bursts into the room bellowing, "NO! Our weapons are no match for Cxaxukluth, The Blackness from the Stars. Cxaxukluth uses comets to deliver his messages of creation! We must divert our entire telecommunications infrastructure to communicate with the comet in order to discover his all-powerful commandments!" The lunatic collapses, mumbling gibberish.
