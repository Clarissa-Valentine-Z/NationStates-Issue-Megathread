[b][anchor=880]#880[/anchor]: Oh @@NAME@@, What Obscene Children's Books You Have [Jutsa; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The oldest versions of the popular children's book, [i]Little Violet Voyaging Veil[/i], have been released to the public, and are causing quite a stir amongst the more conservative teachers of @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "I didn't much care for the story from the beginning," mutters kindergarten teacher @@RANDOMNAME@@, fanning @@HIM@@self with a handkerchief, "but when I found out about this, I was flatout disgusted!  Did you know that in one of the original versions, both of them are voraciously eaten by the wolf, while another shows the protagonist actually eating the grandmother?  These stories were obviously not made for kids, and it is revolting that we still encourage our children to read these same stories with a bit of sugar-coating.  We must ban stories like these from ever being sold!"

2. "Oh, please!  It's just a harmless fairy-tale," dismisses Tom S. Boulder, the author of many bestselling but tepid rewrites.  "Modern children's stories are only loosely based on their original versions, anyway.  Even the originals often bore little resemblance to one another.  Just incentivise authors to focus on the gentle and positive aspects of these lovely stories, like in my version, [i]Miniature Yellow Traveling Goods Salesman[/i], and no one should have anything to worry about."

3. "You shouldn't shelter children from any of these books - period!" Ro Jennifer complains, thumbing through a copy of an unveiled original with a terrifying cover.  "Heck, they used to be around to make sure kids don't end up in a similar situation!  If you put so much as a dusting of sugar on them, they'll be pointless.  We should be encouraging kids to take a look at the darker original stories so they can begin to see the blood-drenched, brutal, naked reality of the world as it truly is."

[b][anchor=881]#881[/anchor]: Blooming Out of Proportion [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Your sister, who is an auction addict, has just given you a pot of white-dotted pink Gallopavian gladioli. She purchased it at auction for 500,000 @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@, which she insists was a great bargain. Taking advantage of this, your financial advisors are prodding you to consider the possibility that gladiolus prices may have gone out of control in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "Your sister could have bought a fancy apartment in downtown @@CAPITAL@@ for that sum!" exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Finance Minister, leaning over the pot to sniff the flowers and turning away in disgust. "Eww, and they don't even smell nice! This only shows that we have a gladiolus bubble building up, and Violet only knows when it will burst, blowing away the investors' money and collapsing our economy. A financial crisis is the last thing we need now. You should set a ceiling trading price for gladioli and other goods that deviate too far from their actual intrinsic values, and put an end to unstable markets based on frenzied speculation!"

2. "Whoa, since when do we meddle with the free market economy?" asks Viceroy O. J. Busbeck, a flamboyant merchant, who is renowned for his Gallopavian gladiolus corm importing business. "You can't put a price on these gorgeous flowers! Well... I mean to say, you can. You know what I mean! Do you know how much effort and expertise are required to cultivate these rare gladiolus varieties? In fact, your government's public finances could benefit massively if you were to buy a billion @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ worth of gladioli, and you could probably sell them in a month or two for twice that! I'll even wrap them up in a small bouquet for you! Speculative trading is a guaranteed win-win, right? Just buy flowers, and watch our economy blossom!"

3. "Well, after a while the bloom will be off the gladiolus. What will you do then?" muses Agricultural Minister @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Paying crazy amounts of money for these corms enriches Gallopavia and is wrecking our balance of trade. But I know a way out of this. @@LEADER@@, we should subsidise flower farmers to cultivate our own surprisingly-similar gladioli, and undercut Gallopavian traders in the international market. We'll need to weaken the Gallopavian brand though... maybe a few fabricated health scares will do the trick."

The Issue
@@CAPITAL@@'s latest scandal [i]du jour[/i] is a tragic incident in which a 2[sup]nd[/sup] grader with a peanut allergy died after a classmate shared a box of chocolate candies with peanut and caramel fillings. Now some parents are saying that @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ schools need to do more to protect students with food allergies.

The Debate
1. "How could the school allow this?" wails @@RANDOMFIRSTNAMEFEMALE@@ @@RANDOMLASTNAME_1@@, the mother of the @@BOY_2@@ who died. "It's totally irresponsible! Students shouldn't be allowed to bring food from home and cafeterias should only serve food that no one is allergic to."

2. "Life is like a box of chocolates," says renowned sprinter Forrest Gumbo, apparently oblivious to how tone-deaf he sounds. "You never know what you're gonna get. If you ban peanuts, you'll get a student who's allergic to shellfish. If you ban shellfish, you'll get a student who's allergic to wheat. You can't ban it all. If your kid has a food allergy, it's up to you to make sure they know what's safe to eat and what's not."

3. "Screw you! You think I don't talk to my kids?" snaps @@RANDOMFIRSTNAMEMALE@@ @@LASTNAME_1@@ the father of the deceased student. "I'm not the one who gave @@RANDOMNAME_2@@ that goddamn candy! If you want parents to be able to protect our children, then give us some control! There's no reason for kids to be eating at school no matter where the food came from. Instead, you should invest in some decent transportation so you can send kids home for meals and let them eat with their family."

[b][anchor=883]#883[/anchor]: Who Let the Dinos Out? [Singapore No2; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Mesozoic Park, the largest dinosaur zoo in the country, has made the headlines for yet another disastrous dinosaur escape. Apparently, the gate of a [i]Tyrannosaurus Rex[/i] pen malfunctioned, giving the horde of formerly captive reptiles a window to flee their enclosure. The liberated T-Rex horde then proceeded to go on a rampage through @@CAPITAL@@, killing hundreds and wrecking city infrastructure. Following the crisis, many citizens are calling for the closure of dinosaur zoos.

The Debate
1. "We cannot allow the zoo to continue like this!" demands @@RANDOMNAME@@, a frustrated cleaner, who has been toiling for hours mopping up innumerable gallons of blood from the streets. "Those dumb behemoths completely leveled several streets, and would have continued if not for that surprisingly muscular palaeontologist motorcyclist, those two annoying kids and that conveniently located fireworks factory nearby. I'm not saying that we should destroy these creations, but we shouldn't be putting them on display and giving them opportunities to run loose."

2. "This is an overreaction," claims @@RANDOMNAME@@, the Head of Scientific Research, who doesn't appear to be remotely disturbed by the high body count. "While there may be some downsides to having dinosaurs on display to the public, the research data that we can draw from them is irreplaceable. Attractions like Mesozoic Park, and my new project Mesozoic City, also help advance academic studies of their behaviour and in how they might have interacted with human beings in prehistoric times. Let's lose this obsession with 'health and safety' and keep the dinosaur zoos open! For Science!"

3. "Thou must vanquish the greatest foe of humanity!" shrieks Don @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, a chemically-unbalanced elderly man, as he grips his spear and glares with hostility at a dino-decorated mini-golf windmill. "I hath fought all manner of wild beasts throughout the ages, but these monstrosities are the most wretched and vile. In the name of righteousness, thou must smite this evil breed from the face of the earth! Have at thee, beasts!" He lays into the plastic windmill, sending broken shards all around.

[b][anchor=884]#884[/anchor]: You're Psychotic, @@LEADER@@ [Jutsa; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
A palace guard had to torture one of your most trusted aides today after hearing him murmur to another advisor that the WA has classified your beloved nation as a psychotic dictatorship. After your brother related the torture in gory detail during a family dinner, the topic of how to improve your image with the WA has come up.

The Debate
1. "Let the people have a bit of political freedom," announces your nephew, whose authoritarianism is tempered only by his strange love for democracy. "The people love you and your tough but fair demeanor! Get the rubber stamp of a democratically free vote and you'll get to keep the populace in check - and maybe the WA will back off with their 'psychotic' talk."

2. "The only freedom @@NAME@@ needs is freedom on the entrepreneurial front," proposes @@RANDOMNAME@@, a shady Eckie-Ecola executive known for @@HIS/HER@@ iron-fisted consumerism, who is currently serving Eckie-Ecolas to your family. "You should focus on promoting big multinational businesses in @@NAME@@ and slashing the regulation on them. Think about the economic growth that'd come from it, all while you retain your power and keep the populace from running rampant. With a freer economy I'm sure the World Assembly will be open to considering @@NAME@@ in a different light."

*3. "We can't let fickle democratic will run the government or multinationals run the economy, but we should let people run themselves," suggests your father, who always seems to know what's best for you. "As long as they aren't challenging your power, they should be allowed to go wherever they want, do whatever they want, buy whatever they want, heck, even start their own private businesses. Enough so the World Assembly might reconsider, anyway." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

*4.

"As long as they aren't challenging your power, they should be allowed to go wherever they want, do whatever they want, buy whatever they want, heck, even make it easy for them to start their own businesses. Enough so the World Assembly might reconsider, anyway." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

5. "Don't listen to those anarchists from the World Assembly," comments your sister, while simultaneously offering her after-dinner cake to the butler that served it to her. "Just because they can't see that you're helping your citizens by giving them structure does not mean that you're doing anything wrong. You should instead denounce the World Assembly and tell your people you're only doing what's right. Perhaps you can prove this by bumping the health care and welfare systems a bit?"

6. "MWWHAHAHA!" maniacally laughs your brother, who is covered in @@ANIMAL@@ blood for some reason. "They want to see psychotic? We'll show them psychotic! Rain down oppression and mayhem on all of your little playthings! Well, except for your family, of course."

[b][anchor=885]#885[/anchor]: Has Beans [Perezidence; ed: Nation of Quebec & Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
Irritable but sleepy residents of @@NAME@@ have been stymied in their attempts to start the day thanks to a sudden and severe shortage of coffee. As the rate of employees sleeping on the job skyrockets, your citizens are drowsily demanding relief.

The Debate
1. A mustachioed man calling himself Juan Valdez, seen wearing a sombrero and serape and leading a burro, shows up and makes you an offer. "I can get @@NAME@@ access to supplies of high quality coffee more than adequate for the caffeinated quaffing needs of your people. Imagine how much more productive workers will be once they've had their fix of the brown stuff in the morning. Managers across the nation will thank you."

2. "You do know that there are other caffeinated beverages, right?" yawns your visibly tired Finance Minister. "In fact, this could be a boon for the nation's soft drink companies. Imagine the windfall for Mountain Spew Inc. - not to mention my stock portfolio - if all @@DEMONYMNOUNPLURAL@@ have to switch to soft drinks and energy drinks to get their fixes."

3. "Switching to soft drinks? Are you out of your drowsy mind?" objects your stunned Health Minister. "This will be horrible for @@NAME@@'s health! Do this and you can expect to see diabetes rates skyrocket and obesity grow into a huge problem, pun fully intended. Why not turn everyone on to healthy alternatives, like water? Maybe the government can launch a health initiative to remind people of the benefits of H[sub]2[/sub]O, and make sure that tap water is tested for the finest quality and purity."

4. Your wheeling and dealing nephew sidles up to you with a proposition of his own. "Hey, I know some guys who know some guys. They could hook us up with a supply of Wezeltonian beans. With my connections and suitable market restrictions, we could open a chain of government-run coffee houses with a monopoly on the brew. We could charge whatever we wanted!"

[b][anchor=886]#886[/anchor]: Bounty on the Table [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Popular TV show [i]@@ANIMAL@@ the Bounty Hunter[/i] was recently canceled after the eponymous fugitive-finder accidentally shot and killed three innocent bystanders. Now, the legality of the profession of bounty hunting is being called into question.

The Debate
1. "Those bounty hunters ain't nothin' but trouble, creating a grand ol' fuss wherever they go," drawls Sheriff @@RANDOMNAME@@, while holstering @@HIS@@ six-shooter. "I reckon bounty huntin' ought not be allowed. Us lawmen can deal with outlaws just fine ourselves! Problem is, ma deputies are busier than a centipede at a leg-countin' contest. We need to up our police spendin' somethin' fierce, then we'll have these criminals whupped soon enough."

2. "Cops are too concerned with the 'order' part of law and order," states the leather-clad, heavily-tattooed bounty hunter. "We hunters can get the job done, and if we don't, you don't have to pay us. While cops are too busy scarfing down doughnuts and taking 'sensitivity training' to catch the bad guys, we're out in the real world, on the trail of the outlaws. Slash your police force and put bounties on the heads of all criminals. You can bet our kind will have the streets of @@NAME@@ free of scum by the end of the month, or my name ain't '@@ANIMAL@@'."

3. "This whole incident just illustrates the dangers of trying to chase criminals," declares a random citizen, remarkable only for his thick glasses, large nose, and bushy mustache. "If criminals run away from law enforcement, that should be the end of it; chasing them is simply too risky. I'm sure those coppers will have another chance to catch me - I mean - [i]those criminals[/i]."

[b][anchor=887]#887[/anchor]: Thin Skin [New Fulford; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Popular fashion magazine [i]Astropolitan[/i] has recently been criticized for heavy-handed use of photo-editing software to make their models appear slimmer, smoother-skinned and paler. A riot of fashionistas and equality advocates have sashayed and stumbled into your office to debate the issue.

The Debate
1. "Photograph enhancement is nothing new, darling," slurs renowned fashion designer Carla Largerfield. "For my clothes to look as gorgeous as possible, we need to make our models look as gorgeous as possible! If that means adjusting them down in post, then that's what we do. We're selling a dream of something better, not tawdry reality. What right does the government have to dictate how we edit our magazines? Besides, it's not like we're hurting anyone."

2. "Not hurting anyone, she says! LIES!" screams social worker @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Young girls across @@NAME@@ read her magazines and think they need to conform to the faked physiques they see. Let's not even talk about the implicit racism in deliberately whitening skin tones! I implore you, make photographic enhancement of models illegal, for the sake of the children!"

3. "Simply banning photo-editing is insufficient," proclaims plus-sized pop star Megan Plimsoll. "It's abhorrent that only tall, slim women are considered for modelling jobs when the clothes will be sold to women of all shapes and sizes. I suggest a government mandate declaring that fashion designers must fairly represent women of every size on their catwalks and in their photoshoots. Only then can we start to fight inequality in the fashion industry."

4. Your Minister for Friendly Solutions, @@RANDOMNAME@@, suggests an alternative solution: "How about instead of setting quotas or inflicting bans, we try and change society. Let art bring forth a candle. A big fat tallow candle. I suggest you tax the fashionistas and use that money to subsidize artists who are making positive depictions of the plus sized: a big-boned bronze statue here, a Rubenesque nude there. Denounce commercial culture, and promote fine art of the fat!"

The Issue
Led by a club of grandmothers known as the Naughty Knitters, a new street art sensation has begun spreading across the cities of @@NAME@@. Called "yarn bombing" by those who partake in it, avid knitters don twee knitted balaclavas and take to the streets at night - covering lampposts, railings, and on one occasion, a parked vehicle with colorful knitted patterns.

The Debate
1. "We certainly don't mean any harm, pet," exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, ringleader of the Naughty Knitters, as @@HE@@ takes your measurements. "We're just trying to brighten up people's lives and bring a little cheer! You should be helping us, not punishing us. How about using some of those taxes we've all been paying to fund arts and crafts for everyone? My grandkids just love making finger puppets! Now, what color did you want that sweater, dear? I've got a nice lilac yarn here somewhere..."

2. "Street 'art' is just a nice way to say anti-social littering in my book," grunts city mayor @@RANDOMNAME@@, sporting a well-tailored hypoallergenic suit. "The graffiti is bad enough, but I've got people tripping up over strands of yarn all the way down the high street! We should arrest these grandmothers for making our streets such a mess."

3. "Arresting a few old ladies isn't going far enough!" cries your Minister of Urban Planning, angrily brushing off some stray rainbow yarn from the sleeve of @@HIS@@ coat. "We have to ban all so-called 'public artwork' in order to keep things looking respectable. Furthermore, we should enforce strict regulations on the supply of knitting yarn, painting supplies, and do-it-yourself peg dolly kits, to ensure that such supplies are only available to truly artistically talented citizens of @@NAME@@."

The Issue
A diplomatic crisis erupted recently after particularly bloodthirsty @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ pirates made the entire crew of a captured Macronesian oil tanker walk the plank. Following the incident, Macronesian authorities have declared that they will sink any @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ vessel that enters their waters until the pirate attacks stop.

The Debate
1. "These allegations be scurvy hogwash!" claims @@RANDOMNAME@@, the pirate quartermaster, wearing a purely decorative eyepatch. "We ran a shot across the bow, but them scallywags aboard the galleon decided to run a rig and fight back, forcing us to give them no quarter. Word has it that the Macronesian navy has assembled themselves a massive armada, and they be wishing to blow our binnacles to the poop deck. Our cannon and cutlasses are no match for their cruise missiles, so we would be thankful if ye could give us more advanced weaponry to stand a chance against these landlubbers. Arrrrr..."

2. "We'd like to see those rapscallions try," challenges @@RANDOMNAME@@, the Defence Minister of Macronesia, while hoisting the national flag upside-down to signify a state of war. "These cowardly sea barbarians have attacked our defenceless merchant vessels for long enough. Their home ports are in @@NAME@@, so you have a moral responsibility to contribute to military efforts to eliminate them, and should pay Macronesia reparations for the harm done to us by @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ nationals. Never forget that Macronesia rules the waves, and that those who oppose us will meet watery graves!"

3. "We might have to compromise a little to stay in business," concedes @@RANDOMNAME@@, the self-proclaimed 'Admiral of the Black', whose operations haven't been in the black for years. "We should avoid plundering ships from nations with large navies like Macronesia; we don't want to be bilged on our own anchor after all. However, many other nations - such as Moltovea - lack a proper navy and are easy pickings. You should enforce a rule that prohibits the pillaging of vessels from countries with naval superiority. Just list the nations that have less seapower than us, and we'll make sure you get your share of the spoils."

"No, I'm not talking about that awful guitar-and-drums noise pollution that angry teenage boys call music. I'm talking about all that cobalt, cadmium and so on all locked up inside used batteries and old electronics. Institute mandatory recycling of said items along with simultaneous tariffs on heavy metals from non-recycled sources. It's the greenest solution."

6. "Perhaps if we weren't always throwing away old electronics in the first place, this wouldn't be a problem," says cabin-dwelling woodcutter @@RANDOMNAME@@, proudly showing you @@HIS@@ Blokia 3310 cellphone from thirty years ago.

Street preachers delivering their sermons and self-proclaimed salvation have been popping up all over @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "These people chase all of my customers away!" exclaims restaurateur @@RANDOMNAME@@. "I own a premier establishment in downtown @@CAPITAL@@. Every day I lose more and more business thanks to these crazy bigots and extremists rambling on about the 'end times' and 'confessing our sins'! One of them tried to convert my cook!

I am the deliverer of salvation and you shall not interfere! All @@DEMONYMNOUNPLURAL@@ are equal before our Creator and will be judged irrespective of wealth or status! Follow me and together we will be prepared to face the end days to come!"

3. "There is a better way to go about this," suggests @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Compromises. "The most common complaints against street preaching are on the grounds of harassment and noise pollution.

"I'd need to be an accountant to convert all my old recipes, and how do you expect me to quickly know how much broth I need when the measurement isn't straight from the box itself?

The Issue
You and several high-ranking members of your government have gone out for dinner together. As soon as you are seated, your server sets down a basket full of complimentary bread rolls.

The Debate
1. "Seriously? I don't even like this kind of bread!" exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, one of your top ministers, as @@HE@@ pushes the basket away with a look of disgust on @@HIS@@ face. "Now it's going to go to waste, and for what? Some sort of 'establishment thoughtfulness' or 'diner appeal'? They should have to ask before bringing you these so-called 'complimentary' add-ons, because this waste of food insults the efforts of the farmers and bakers that produced it. Bread, water, those little mints you get with the check - all this stuff adds up! It's bad for consumers and bad for the environment."

2. "I'm very sorry for the inconvenience," commiserates your server, apparently named @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ judging by @@HIS@@ name-tag, while bowing @@HIS@@ head in apology. "I certainly understand your concerns. However, our complimentary breads are just that: complimentary, a bonus, free!

3. "What's even the big deal?" asks a busboy who is supposed to be cleaning a nearby table. "Just leave the rolls out for the next customer.

The Issue
A feasibility study into railway lines in the boondocks of @@NAME@@ has suggested that they are economically unsustainable. It is reported that some lines are running trains with less than one passenger per carriage on average. The committee behind the study has suggested that these lines be shut down, and replaced with coach services.

"While buses may offer somewhat slower travel, they can offer more tailored and direct routes for small towns with small populations. They're also cheap and require far less maintenance."

2. "Stupid, bloody townies!" screams @@RANDOMNAME@@, a disgruntled long-term resident of an isolated mountain village. "We need good and sturdy transport to get anywhere safely and comfortably, and to maintain trade and supply links with the rest of the country. The rail might not make a direct profit, but it stimulates the wider economy. The government should pay for rail connections to every place that has someone living in it. Plus, have you ever been on a long distance bus? That many folk in a small enclosed space for that many hours... well, let's just say travel sickness isn't the only reason passengers feel nauseous."

3. "I don't see why rural people need public transport at all," protests @@RANDOMNAME@@, a city dweller holding a 'Taxation is Theft' placard. "If they choose to live in isolation, then they should deal with the consequences. It's not like in the city, where commuter trains are standing room only. Not only should you cut government spending on public transport to rural communities, you should reinvest it in city centre infrastructure."

The Issue
@@CAPITAL@@ General Hospital is facing heavy criticism for towing a cancer patient's car away for failing to pay the parking fees. Critics claim that the charges are far too high and that the hospital acted cruelly, while the hospital insists that the income source is necessary to help offset costs of operation.

The Debate
*1. "The hospital is already charging us up to our eyeballs in medical bills, and this adds further insult to our literal injuries!" complains @@RANDOMNAME@@, a hospital patient seen dragging along an IV bag. "The government must crack down on these greedy hospitals taking advantage of the sick. Ban them from charging people to park their cars! If they're really that strapped for cash, they can always run a charity drive or something." [[color=blue]Must not have universal healthcare[/color] AND [color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2 "The @@DEMONYMADJECTIVEINITIALS@@NHS is meant to give us healthcare free at the point of delivery, and these charges are adding insult to our literal injuries!" complains @@RANDOMNAME@@, a hospital patient seen dragging along an IV bag. "The government must crack down on these greedy hospitals taking advantage of the sick. Ban them from charging people to park their cars! If they're really that strapped for cash, they can always run a charity drive or something." [[color=red]Must have universal healthcare[/color] OR [color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

**3. "You people do realize that our private hospitals cost money to run, right?" asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, the CEO of @@CAPITAL@@ General. "We get thousands of patients and visitors each day that we need to look after, and the fees we collect from parking greatly help us pass the savings down to our custom... er... patients. Look, if people want to avoid parking rates, then the government can just pay the charges." [[color=blue]Must not have have universal healthcare[/color] AND [color=blue]must have private industry[/color]]

**4. "You people do realize that @@DEMONYMADJECTIVEINITIALS@@NHS hospitals have limited budgets, right?" asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, the Chairman of the @@CAPITAL@@ General Hospital Trust. "We get thousands of patients and visitors each day that we need to look after, and the fees we collect from parking greatly help us save money for our bonuses... er... the taxpayer. Look, if people want to avoid parking rates, then the government should increase funding to cover the budget shortfall that would create." [[color=red]Must have universal healthcare[/color] OR [color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

[5]. "As always, the private sector has a solution!" exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, owner of a ride sharing service. "What if patients and hospital visitors called us and we drove them right to the hospital? That way they won't have to worry about their cars getting towed. We've also been looking to get into the ambulance service, and with some government funding, we could expand our business model across all of @@NAME@@! Apply competition and market forces to emergency transportation, and watch those response times fall!" [[color=blue]must have private industry[/color]]

The Issue
In response to the increasing number of faith-based afterschool programs across @@NAME@@, a prominent anti-religion organization has proposed [i]Lessons with Lucifer[/i], a tongue-in-cheek program designed to encourage critical thinking. The vociferous backlash comes to a head when you collect your niece from school.

The Debate
1. "This is preposterous!" cries parent @@RANDOMNAME@@, as @@HE@@ plasters every available surface of your car with [i]My God Loves Me[/i] bumper stickers, which @@HE@@ pulls from an apparently bottomless satchel. "The program even says 'Lucifer'! Do not allow these heretics near our precious darlings. Ensure our children are only exposed to religions that are decent and founded on something real." @@HE@@ runs out of space to place bumper stickers and starts hanging garlic cloves from your rearview mirror.

2. "These ideological attitudes are exactly why our program is so necessary," insists a sharply-dressed man in a black suit and sporting a twisted goatee. "No-one has any problem when these religious nuts force their beliefs on the nation's children, yet everyone's up in arms about the name of our program. [i]Lessons with Lucifer[/i] is all about teaching kids to have an open mind. It's [i]not[/i] devil-worship. It's rationalism, to prevent kids growing up like this superstitious wacko. You should set children free to explore alternatives to the kooky bull peddled by their parents. Don't you believe in freedom of religion, @@LEADER@@?"

3. "It's sad," mumbles your niece, clambering into the backseat of your vehicle. "I don't like seeing all these poor unbelievers hanging around. I know they're all going to suffer everlasting torment when they die. I just wish that someone who really loved their niece, and had a lot of power, would bravely make sure that everyone followed the one true religion so they would all be safe forever. Or else."

4. "There is another option," whispers a hooded figure as they slither up to your side, offering you a contract on leathery parchment and written in sinister scarlet ink. "Permit me to introduce myself... I'm just a devilishly-handsome guy, who's raring to be your new Education Minister. I have a lot of bold ideas for reform, at no price to the taxpayer. Well, not in @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@, anyway..." Cackling, he flees, leaving behind the contract and an unusually sulphurous smell that you hope is a bad stomach rather than brimstone.

The Issue
Slave owners across @@NAME@@ report increased antagonistic behavior from their slaves. The masters' position is made more precarious in some rural areas of the country, where the enslaved outnumber everyone else by four to one. Fearing imminent rebellion, you have met with prominent slavers in the extravagant cocktail lounge of the @@CAPITAL@@ Auction House to discuss a solution.

The Debate
1. "These are dark days, @@LEADER@@; we must economize," concedes a wealthy slaver as @@HE@@ struggles to jam an olive onto @@HIS@@ own cocktail stick. "We have far more slaves than we can comfortably control. We have to downscale before we have a rebellion on our uncalloused hands. I propose that we hold the largest slave auction ever, in this very building. We'll invite all the great masters of the world and export our excess chattel. Then, we'll no longer be threatened, and we'll have plenty of dough to boot!"

2. "Addressing the slaves' aggression is easier," opines @@RANDOMNAME@@, a young basket weaving magnate, taking a sip from @@HIS@@ drink. "If you all treated your slaves with the kindness I do, they would adore you and would never wish to rebel. I grant all slaves a fifteen minute break every day and one whole @@CURRENCY@@ biannually, to spend as they wish! We should also allow them to keep a percentage of the things they produce; a little light labor is nothing when it earns you a free basket."

3. "For an owner, you sure do have that slave morality," growls @@RANDOMNAME@@, infamously the cruelest slave owner in @@NAME@@, as @@HE@@ lovingly caresses @@his@@ whip. "We need slaves, but we must not make ourselves vulnerable. Slaves must wear identification tattoos, and their time and behavior must be closely monitored. Punish any disobedience with public beatings, or a bloody execution: that's how a slave learns to mind their manners."

4. "There is only one way to prevent a rebellion," declares @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, the widow of a late slave holder, as she pours herself a boysenberry mocktail from the bar. "Free all the slaves and ban slavery. I freed all my husband's slaves last week and no harm has befallen me. People are more productive if they aren't living in fear, if they're working for fair compensation. These slaves are human beings and our fellow @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@. Break their chains and set your @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ free!"

The Issue
Qraft of @@NAME@@, the largest dairy corporation in the nation, is facing grating criticism in the form of letters and protests involving blue cheese stink bombs. The denunciation of the company comes from independent rural cheesemakers angered over the production of individually wrapped slices of processed cheese, or singles. Cheese traditionalists, dairy dons, and queso collectivists have intruded on your peaceful lunch at the @@CAPITAL@@ Deli to make their voices heard over the sounds of the mechanical slicing of cheese.

The Debate
1. "Zese vile @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ corporations are appropriating ze label of cheese, as if le plastique is authentique!" laments the passionate and flamboyant Vincent Fromage, Brancaland's famous cheese connoisseur, as he smears moose brie on a slice of toasted bread. "Zese bland mockeries of real cheese are a disgrace to this nation's cheesemaking heritage. Ze corporations should be restricted from calling zese glorified napkins 'cheese' and save that label for propeur products like Brancaland's wondeurful blocks and roulettes, or Smalltopian Muenster, or..." He stops to clean breadcrumbs off his flashy suit.

2. "That's not enough to stop FAKE CHEESE! My comrade is merely a petty bourgeois puppet for the @@DEMONYMADJECTVIE@@ Chiefs of Cheddar," exclaims Karl Engels Bryndza, a notorious Brancalandian social and economic reformer and part time milk-sourer, as he consumes a grilled @@CAPITAL@@ Jack sandwich. "REAL cheese traditionalists are tired of the oppression systematically imposed by dairy corporations. I say it's time for us, the real cheesemakers, to take control! Seizing the means of production if you will. We will strip away the tyranny of those corrupt corporations like Qraft!"

3. A large figure emerges from the shadows of the deli's backroom. "Alas, only when it comes to cheese do these Marxists seem to care about our culture," sighs the immense silhouette of Qraft's CEO, known only as The Big Cheese. "These uneducated peasants always threaten to regulate industry, or even seize control of the nation's companies. My company has every right to call our processed singles 'cheese,' even if they happen to be wobbly slices of soured milk, orange coloring, and emulsifiers. You don't expect citizens to buy 'individually-wrapped cheese product' or 'pre-sliced cheese substitute,' do you?"

4. "What a bunch of radical lunatics!" remarks @@RANDOMNAME@@, mayor of a dairy village in the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ countryside. "Biggie Cheese over here and that Karl Angle character are using a topic as trivial as the production of cheese to increase their power and influence. However, Mister Cheese was right about leaving the processed cheese industry alone." She eats a cube of smelly @@ANIMAL@@ cheese with a toothpick. "Many of these bumpkins, I mean craftsmen, live in poverty. Giving them a little assistance would satisfy the blessed cheesemakers, and ensure that they stick to making authentic @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ cheese rather than intervene with the productivity of our processed cheese single factories."
