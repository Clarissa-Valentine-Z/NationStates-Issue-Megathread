[b][anchor=520]#520[/anchor]: Preach With Me If You Want To Live [Raionitu; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The military has seen a sharp rise in complaints against chaplains who often pressure soldiers, particularly atheists and those adhering to foreign religions, into converting prior to battle. Military officials and soldiers have come for your guidance as the chaplain issue has brought troop morale to an all time low.

The Debate
1. "Of course we need chaplains, for the soldiers' peace of mind!" pleads long-serving chaplain, fourth Lieutenant @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while taking a break from trying to convert your staff. "If we give them the comfort and blessings of the Creator, their quality of life, happiness, and motivation will greatly improve. Granted, they may lose focus from all the people trying to convert them, but at least their souls will join the Creator!"

2. "Oh please. The last thing I need before I die is some loudmouth preacher trying to convert me!" complains pessimistic Private and proud atheist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ as he uses your handkerchief to polish his weapon. "All us soldiers would be better off, and more willing to stay alive, without these crazy chaplains telling us how 'our deaths are meaningless' or that we're 'eternally damned' if we don't convert. For the sake of soldiers' peace and quiet, military chaplains must be banned! Religion has no place in the military."

3. "Well, the problem isn't the presence of religion, it's that my troops are hearing it in the wrong place," suggests the devout seventh battalion commander, Captain @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We must make the military accommodating to all beliefs in the interest of tolerance and fairness. Sure, you might end up with some oddballs, like that captain in ninth battalion who worships the flying purple meatball monster or people who don't believe anything at all, but hey, at least our troops can find their own path to spiritual enlightenment.

[4]. "These chaplains have gotten me thinking," muses the head of the @@CAPITAL@@ chapter of @@FAITH@@, whose sparkling ten-foot tall hat was recognizable from miles away. "Why don't you place the military under our command? After a massive expansion, we can force all soldiers to convert so we can wage a divine holy war against the heathens and non-believers in @@REGION@@. Then once we've purged @@REGION@@ of its sins, we can turn our attention to the blasphemers in our own country. Ahh, the Almighty will surely look upon our work with great favour! All I need is your signature here." [[color=purple]Must have a national religion[/color]]

[b][anchor=521]#521[/anchor]: The Wreck Of The Edward Fitzpatrick [Drawkland; ed: Logophilia Lyricalia][/b]

The Issue
The media's obsession of the week is the "Edward Fitzpatrick," a @@DENONYMADJECTIVE@@ ore freighter that sank in a sudden freak storm while shipping its haul of raw taconite across Great @@ANIMAL@@ Lake for smelting. The ship, its cargo, and crew were all lost.

The Debate
1. "Oh, well, this is a terrible disaster," sighs Remus Titan, CEO of Consolidated Resource Acquisition Partners. "Do you know how many tons of ore that ship was carrying? That's hundreds of thousands of @@CURRENCY@@ my company's lost!" Wiping a kerchief across his brow, he continues. "You know, the government really ought to send some money our way to make up for the lost capital. It's for the best. With a hefty tax break, we can make sure such a terrible tragedy doesn't happen to our bottom line - uh, employees - again."

2. Bereaved family member Andrea Doria, still in funeral attire, shoves your secretary aside as she storms into your office. "Do you realize what a horrible crime this wreck really was? I'll have you know that one of the sailors on the Edward Fitzpatrick was my husband's cousin's half-brother! Do you know how much this has impacted me and my family? All because those mining industry jackals don't give a damn about their employees!" She takes a breath and continues, "My point is, those weasels should be forced to pay reparations to the families of the victims, AND overhaul their whole fleet - more lifeboats, more safety regulations, engine tune-ups, the works! Maybe if they actually cared about those sailors they wouldn't have sent them out on such a ramshackle old hulk."

3. "You're missing the whole point," cries model train enthusiast Lionel Brio as he starts laying track all over your office. "The problem here is that we were using the wrong kind of transport in the first place! Boats are old and prone to sink, and rocks don't exactly float." He gets a gleam in his eye as a six-inch locomotive blows smoke in your face. "What we need is trains. Picture it: we convert mining transport to railways, and all the danger of sailing will become a thing of the past! It won't be cheap, but we'll have the best rail network in @@REGION@@, and more importantly I'll get some new model freight cars for my collection!"

4. Jordan Brighthand, a popular @@DENONYMADJECTIVE@@ folk singer, strides into your office, a battered acoustic guitar slung on his shoulder. "You know, @@LEADER@@, the story of this shipwreck has really inspired me," he says as he strums out a melody. "Let's face it, you can't stop tragedies like this. It's just fate. But what we can do is immortalize the victims in song, so that future generations of @@DENONYMPLURAL@@ can hear the stories of our past. It sure beats reading about 'em - why stick your nose in a book when your guitar can gently weep over the coffins?"

5. "Well the answer's clear to me," says Hal Stoker, the most popular weather forecaster in @@CAPITAL@@. "This was a failure by meteorologists all around Great @@ANIMAL@@ Lake. This is a red flag that's telling you to pour some government funds into the @@DENONYMADJECTIVE@@ Institute of Meteorology. Our weather forecasters have been poorly trained on outdated equipment for years as the Institute languished. We really need better gear; the new Rotating Aerial Inversion Navigator, that's the RAIN-420 doppler radar, is a real beauty, I gotta get my hands on that - oh, uh, and we'll save some lives, too."

The Issue
It's a slow news day, and so a recent study by the Scientific Centre of Analytical Metadata is getting considerable attention. After a decade of expensive travel to exotic climes, researchers have concluded that nations where people laugh more have a lower GDP. Your advisers have gathered to find out what you want to do.

The Debate
1. "That's just a funny coincidence!" yells joke shop owner @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ as she waves a rubber-chicken at you, her cheeks puffed out in anger. "Laughter is a tonic! Laughter is the best medicine! If you take away laughter, you destroy the beating heart of @@NAME@@! Dismiss this crackpot theory and keep the joy that makes @@NAME@@ so great... by subsidising the humour-retail industry!"

2. "At last! The link is proven!" notes clothes factory owner @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ as he spies on his staff through CCTV. "I last smiled seventy-two years ago and it is an accident I have striven not to repeat! Every day, the girls who should be working my machines are just laughing. I keep telling them to keep their heads down, but they keep on giggling and smiling and... oh, they're so disobedient! Someone needs to punish them. Give employers the right to dock wages and force extra hours for excessive joviality. That'll show those minxes!"

3. "Why so glum when there's shopping to be done?" sings devoted consumer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sporting a lovely green velvet jacket. "Just cut sales taxes on luxury goods so everybody can shop their way out of misery! Your government is wasting money funding thinktanks and research groups of dubious value. You should cut the funding of SCAM and other analysts, and give me back my own @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. The resulting spending spree will put a smile on my face AND boost the economy!"

[4]. "This crass commercialism saddens my heart," observes dour faith leader @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, shaking his head sadly. "What about the soul? Laughter is evil spirits, shaking our bodies. Each guffaw is the spirit of the divine, leaking out of the body. It is Written! For the sake of the collective salvation of @@NAME@@, laughter must be banned!" [[color=purple]Must ban Religion[/color] OR [color=purple]Low Religiousness[/color]]

5. "How can you listen to these people?" asks depressed laughter therapist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dabbing away a tear. "@@NAME@@ needs joy, now more than ever. We need to bring the art of humour and inner happiness into everybody's lives through intensive programmes in every school and workplace in the country. Happiness doesn't just happen: it needs to be taught!"

The Issue
After a recent initiative to plant vast farms of avocados in the tundra of Northern @@NAME@@ proved to be a massive failure, people have begun questioning the wisdom and competence of the highly influential Organization for Unilaterally Researching Science, Trade, Agriculture, Land, Investments and Nationalization. Functionaries from all levels of the Party have lined up outside your office, demanding action.

The Debate
1. "Decline!" roars Kim, Vanguard of the Proletariat, your sister, and overzealous People's Commissar of Enlightenment. "For years we have seen the former glory of higher education sink into an abyss of depravity, idiocy and inefficiency. We must promptly act, before the stains of nepotism and petit bourgeois decadence seep out of the faculty chamber and corrupt every inch of the Party! Purge the incompetents and install only the truest of experts on the council. I would be willing to lead the campaign to bring the means of production and research closer together, for the sake of the @@TYPE@@, of course."

2. "Please don't listen to auntie; you know what she's like with her demagoguery," sighs Kim, leading agricultural researcher and also your nephew. "I'll grant you that the arctic avocados weren't my best idea, and Nikita's fixation with corn farming didn't pan out. However, I'm sure things will get better eventually, and you shouldn't punish creative solutions and youthful enthusiasm! Leave us be, and send auntie and the rest of the revisionists for a standard session of re-proletarianization at the mining operations."

[3]. "Typical. The nomenklatura are unable to see beyond the existing state of things," says Kim, a high ranking Party official that, in a surprising turn of events, has no family connection to you whatsoever. "To advance to the next Historical stage, we must abolish the counter-revolutionary family ties that cloud our judgments and breed corruption. We'll set up mating programs to ensure a healthy flow of offspring and raise all developing @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ as wards of the state. Sure, it doesn't really solve the avocado dilemma, and it might be a tad expensive and complicated to administer, but I'm sure it'll completely eliminate our corruption problem in the long run. Or increase it. Well, there's only one surefire way to find out." [[color=blue]Sex is legal[/color]]

[b][anchor=524]#524[/anchor]: Something Is Rotten In The State Of @@NAME@@ [Kainesia; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
@@NAME@@ has hardly changed its electoral constituencies since King Maxbari IV ruled ancient Maxtopia. After a politician was recently elected to represent 3 people and @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@, people have begun debating the merits of reforming electoral areas, and eliminating the so-called "rotten" constituencies.

The Debate
1. "Aren't we supposed to be a democracy?" shouts political activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has never voted in an election due to living in a town that was an unincorporated bog the last time electoral borders were drawn. "It's inherently unfair that a tiny burrow of inbred farmers gets as many - or even more - representatives as new and major population centres. The government must redraw the electoral map so each seat is elected by the same number of voters."

2. "Isn't that how we got into this mess in the first place, by drawing up boundaries?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the leader of a well-meaning little liberal party that has consistently failed to gain any representation under the current system. "A better idea would be to put an end to the practice of giving seats to different areas, and instead allocate them based on how many votes the parties get nationally. It might lead to complicated coalitions and a risk for complete failure to agree on anything... but at least it will be fair."

3. "How dare these people say such things about our electoral system?" accuses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, self-styled Knight of the Shire, elected to represent a miniscule cluster of rickety chateaus in western @@NAME@@. "We need these constituencies to elect representatives that understand and guard our traditional values. Without them, the government will consist of people with common charisma, but no brains. We could do with rearranging the number of seats each constituency get, however. Just to make sure we elect enough representatives that have a proper understanding of our social order."

[4]. "The right kind of people, yes, hear hear!" agrees Lord Gerry of The Mander, one of your ever-supportive benefactors and campaign donors. "Tradition is grand, splendid in fact. But, election season is nearing, and wouldn't it be nice with a slightly more favourable demographic composition in the voting districts? I've taken the liberty to do a few calculations, and, well, let's just say that a few pen-strokes goes a long way." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

A number of citizens concerned about the lack of water closets in @@NAME@@ have kicked up such a stink that you've agreed to meet the various groups at your convenience.

The Debate
1. "I can't hold it in any longer!" bursts out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, red-faced and desperate. "The need for more free public conveniences in @@NAME@@ is painfully obvious. We demand the government roll out a program of construction lest the lack of them causes a stain on our good nation."

2. "Yes there is a need for more public facilities, but that is such a bog standard solution and would generate so much paperwork," says Luigi Loo, head of @@NAME@@'s largest plumbing contractor, Go With The Flow. "Take the plunge with us and we'll give @@NAME@@ the fanciest conveniences in @@REGION@@. I admit this might require customers to spend a penny or two, but they'll feel flushed with success when they see what they get in return."

3. "I have another solution!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spokesbeing of eccentric primitivist group Nature's Call as they take a stool by your desk. "I suggest you wash your hands of the matter by closing what facilities there are, and allow citizens to get back to basics by making it legal for any of us to use the nearest bush." A twig that you hadn't previously noticed falls from their hair.

The Issue
Residents of an isolated countryside community were powerless to do anything when two armed robbers picked clean the village's three shops in broad daylight. It took the police two hours to arrive on the scene, provoking hysterical outrage over the lack of police presence in outlying rural settlements.

The Debate
1. "I can't sleep at night any more!" sobs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the victims of the crime. "Those criminals could strike back at our peaceful haven at any time! When I was a sprog, we had these local village constables that patrolled the town and had the power to deal with local problems as they saw fit, be it by hanging, whipping or summary execution. Sure, whining liberals said that they were abusing their power, but we need them back! Making the police answer to central bureaucracy was a terrible mistake!"

2. "No, dearie, you're not thinking big enough!" complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, local tractor dealership owner. "An ambulance from our nearest hospital takes an hour just to get here! Refuse collectors turn up once a month! It takes my suppliers several days just to deliver materials we need along our rutted country lanes. I mean, what sort of weird vehicle is meant to be able to handle awful terrain like this? We need asphalt roads and steel rails! Build transport connections to every corner of the country!"

[3]. "What is this, the dark ages?" asks teenage video game fan @@RANDOM_NAME@@, not even looking up from the latest FPS. "Police cars are never going to be fast enough to get to a crime, no matter how good your roads are. You need fast response hubs with enforcement helicopters, rapid insertion airplanes and police paratroopers, all linked to state of the art satellite surveillance technology. Bad guy in the outback?

"Let's not even talk about what I could have done to them if I had my old tommy gun, pineapple grenades and bazooka as well. I'd have blown those mischievous grins off their faces!

The Debate
1. "Momma! Momma! Git the whiskey! No! The gud kind!" shouts @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, the newly-found heir to the House of Ood. "Well, it's about time that my royal 'eritarge is recugnized!

*1. "Ain't nobody got the right to spy on my kin!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@ at a gun rights demonstration outside the capitol building. "It's trespassing is what it is!

3. "Wait, what? What's your beef with drones?" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while piloting a miniature helicopter up to your face. "It's just a harmless way of having fun.

4. "Why do we even allow unmanned aircraft in the first place?" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the Sunday Fliers, a local private pilot's club. "It's obvious that these drones cause nothing but trouble. Just require that any man-made objects flying overhead have a pilot. If they get a little too close with their cameras, we can try the pilots for trespassing."

5. "Obviously we can't just let anyone run around with these things - that would be ludicrous!" sputters the Chief of Police of Cape @@NAME@@. "However, these drones could certainly help my department find fugitives, carry out investigations, y'know, that sort of thing.

[b][anchor=529]#529[/anchor]: Attack Of The Attack Ads [Czechostan; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
As an increasingly tense election season looms, candidates have already begun smearing their opponents with vulgar and offensive campaign advertisements. Politicians and pundits of all corners of the political spectrum have asked you to bring some civility back to politics.

The Debate
1. "Whatever happened to the good old days?" cries MP @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who saw an ebb of support along with a slew of negative ads targeting his large nose. "Politicians used to be elected based on merit, but now the election process has turned into such a sham! One single ad-hominem attack is all it takes to tarnish an honorable politician's career. Not to be nosy, but the government should step in and prevent the media from advertising attack ads and political campaigns from producing them. I can hear the complaints now: 'blah blah free speech, blah blah censorship', but if that's the price to pay to restore honour to politics, then so be it."

2. "If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen," vents political strategist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was the mastermind behind your most recent election victory. "Perhaps the reason the MP lost support was not because of negative campaigning, but rather poor policies and performance. Attack adverts are as old as politics itself and are no more rampant or influential today than than they've ever been - leave them be. I've even taken the liberty of producing a smear campaign for you to use regarding your main opponent being an East Lebatuckese spy who is also part of an illegal organ harvesting cult."

3. "Have you ever thought that maybe there's a good reason @@NAME@@ is gripped by the magic of attack ads?" questions sleazy television executive @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We love filth! We love drama! These issues like 'climate change,' 'corruption,' 'deteriorating relations with Maxtopia,' they're real downers and will they ever REALLY be solved? Surely @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ agree - politics is a spectacle and a blood sport, and one that needs to be drenched in more garbage, not less.

What this country needs is strict new laws and more agents to enforce them in order to properly regulate this regenerative trend and ensure that any and all gardens being planted are conforming to official standards.

We need more manpower, state of the art computer systems, new vehicles, maybe some snappy new uniforms, and of course, new legislation that gives us broader powers to investigate financial crimes, including the subpoenaing and wiretapping of suspects. Give us the resources we need and I'll have those fat cats paying their taxes in no time."

2. "Oh my Violet! What is this communist madness?" screams Alistair Sid, the blue-haired and googly-eyed senior-partner at one of the implicated law firms. "My clients are furious!

It is outrageous! Multinational corporations and the top one percent can suck the wealth from our country dry and then take it offshore to some so-called financial paradise to avoid paying taxes. We need capital controls to prevent economic collapse so we don't end up in an economic mess like Bigtopia. We need to wage war against this corrupt system! Outlaw this practice at once!"

4. "The problem is government and @@LEADER@@'s incompetence," counters noted billionaire Edward Rump, who was coincidentally listed in the Manamana Memos. "People come up to me all the time and tell me that they take their money abroad because they are tired of dealing with the draconian tax code and endless bureaucracy in this country. In order for @@NAME@@ to be great again, we need to prosper and be wealthy. In order to be wealthy, by the way I love the wealthy, we need to simplify the tax code and lower taxes. Freedom will ring and it'll be amazing. So amazing."

The Issue
In a recent high profile trial in @@CAPITAL@@, notorious mobster Maxine 'The Octopus' Barryotti was accused of murder, racketeering, grand theft, and jaywalking. The trial ended in acquittal on all counts after several witnesses - who had given detailed and damning out-of-court statements to police - failed to come to court. The prosecutor's office has now come to you demanding that @@NAME@@ review its laws regarding the use of out-of-court statements.

The Debate
1. "What a miscarriage of justice!" shouts disgruntled district attorney Haley Dent, as she flings a huge stack of police reports on your desk. "Look at all of these great statements made by a dozen witnesses, but now that jerk Maxine goes free just because they didn't personally show up. You know how hard it is to wrangle up a dozen witnesses for trial? Like herding bats! That trial should have ended in a guilty verdict after five minutes, but the way things are it's a coin-flip whether justice is done or not. If a witness makes a report to a cop, that cop should be able to testify to what was said."

2. "You can't be serious!" cries family attorney Tam Hagen, who defended Barryotti. "Don't you realize we have this rule against out-of-court statements for a reason? A person can only have a fair trial if they get to confront their accuser face to face in open court. Sometimes the reason witnesses don't show up to trial is that they know they were lying to police all along! Allowing in all of these out-of-court statements will mean more innocent people get convicted. Sure, sometimes a guilty person will go free... ahem, not my client of course, but some actually guilty person. But isn't it better a thousand guilty people go free than to wrongfully convict even a single person?"

3. "All of this is too complicated," interrupts Mark Commodus, an imperious-seeming minister, "and this right here is why people are so darn sick of all these courts and legal shenanigans. Seems like any way you slice it, dumb rules get in the way of justice. I propose a third way: bring back trial by ordeal! Let the accused wrestle with an @@ANIMAL@@, and if they win they didn't do it and get to go free. If they lose, we lock up or bury whatever remains. It's a foolproof system that our ancestors used for a thousand years, and I'll tell ya, they didn't waste a pretty penny on it!"

The Issue
Following the most recent election, it has come to your attention that some politicians ran unopposed. Some ridings still remain without a representative due to an incredible lack of interest. As apathy rises, you have been called to fix what many are calling a "broken system".

The Debate
1. "I'm disappointed that people don't participate in government," sighs high school civics teacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while trying to squeeze past your bodyguards. "We can't practice democracy if we don't have a choice to make! Here's my solution: elected positions should not be filled until there are multiple candidates. Why not funnel some funding towards encouraging people to stand for election? You could pay people a stipend for taking the time out to run for office, and have a pot of money to pay campaigning expenses of those too poor to fund themselves."

2. A retinue of burly guards clear out all the citizens from your office as the boisterous mayor of @@CAPITAL@@ walks in. "The fact that I have won the last five elections because I was the only candidate means nothing. Actually, it means that the people love me too much to challenge me because I'm the best dang mayor this city's ever had! Don't fix the system, @@LEADER@@, because the system ain't broken. It ought to be left in the hands of people like ourselves who know how to get things done."

3. "Nobody wants to run for office because nobody wants to be in the government," replies your mother as she tries to make dinner plans with you. "Think about it. When was the last time someone who actually presented a challenge ran against you? When I was raising you and your siblings, I'd settle who got to play with the toys by drawing straws, and I think we can use the same approach. People from all over @@NAME@@ could be chosen at random to fill a government office for a fixed term. As an added bonus, it would root out the corrupt career politicians and opportunists, since they couldn't run for office anymore. Sure, these new people aren't as qualified, but fair's fair, right?"

4. "Look at this cat video!" exclaims your easily distracted brother while showing you a video of a kitten being potty trained. "The thing is, @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are too dumb to figure out the issues, let alone the right candidate. Do you really think the average Joe cares about the ongoing oil crisis in Maxtopia or increasing tensions with East Lebatuck? All they care about is making sure they have a slice of pizza while watching their shows. Wouldn't it be easier if you picked the candidates for your Party and screened out the undesirables? The Opposition can of course implement similar rules for their parties. Oh, look, a squirrel!" Your brother runs outside your office and begins to chase a squirrel around a tree.

5. "Ha ha! The kitty thinks it's people!" squees your rather shallow niece after picking up her father's phone. "Isn't it cute? Way cuter than any of those ugly politicians I was supposed to support last election. It would be so much easier for me if I didn't have to worry about voting. With all that time I would save, I could start a vlog!"

[b][anchor=535]#535[/anchor]: NationStates Destroys @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Economy [Ballotonia; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
Productivity numbers in @@NAME@@ are plummeting, while employees are found slacking off on the job playing online games. A game called NationStates is especially blamed for the loss of an enormous amount of man-hours per day.

The Debate
1. "This game is an outrage!" says pointy-haired IT-manager Daniel Olaf Santos, who was recently permabanned from the site for repeated trolling and excessive picspam of phallic images. "Too many people waste their time playing silly simulation games and discussing LOLcats and transgenderism when they should be spending their time productively. Our economy cannot afford this nonsense; let us get rid of those online games, NationStates in particular!" 

2. "Oh, no... oh, no... You can't take away my NationStates! I've got to have my NationStates!" pleads @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prominent figure within the site's Conquer/Reclaim sub-culture. "Uhhh... I mean, uhhh... playing a game is just harmless fun, really, and it works great to reduce stress or helps one to get through a boring day at the office. What we need to do is improve the financial conditions for the people running the site, so they can give us even more features! That'll make all of us happier, and there's nothing better for productivity than a cheerful workforce, right?" 

3. "I'll have you know that NationStates can be used for all sorts of productive purposes," insists @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who looks suspiciously similar to site owner and operator Max Barry, apart from the fake moustache. "It can be a useful educational tool if integrated in school classes on politics and civics, for example. Just imagine it: an entire generation of tech-savvy youngsters armed with first-hand knowledge on how to navigate complex political issues. @@NAME@@ would be the envy of @@REGION@@. What are you waiting for, @@LEADER@@, make NationStates a mandatory part of the curriculum in all schools!"

The Issue
In remote villages of Western @@NAME@@, mobs of angry villagers have taken to lynching women accused of witchcraft. Concerned citizens have come to you to for answers.

The Debate
1. "Well, someone had to do it!" yelps self-appointed head of one of the border towns' lynch mobs, Edward Salem. "That lady was commitin' witcheries left and right, turned my nephew into a newt she did! I mean... he got better, but that's besides the point! The gov'ment needs to let us protect ourselves and rid our peace lovin' towns of these foul she-devils!"

2. "No no, that won't work," says a tall, dark-haired mysterious stranger walking into your office with a gust of wind stirring his long duster coat and hat. He throws a crossbow onto your desk before continuing, "These simple folk do not have the honed skills to hunt witches or any other devil of the night for that matter. But I am a monster hunter. If you set up a sanctioned guild, then we can properly hunt these necromancers."

3. "We'd appreciate it if you would all kindly mind your own business," chastises Hermione Potter, who is dressed in a long black robe and pointed hat. "Our traditions are centuries old, and it is about time the government stepped in and protected us. You'd do well to build us a proper school away from these barbar – oh honestly Ronald, give me that," she takes a carved wand from a young red-headed boy, "it's Lo-go-phil-ia Levi-o-sa, make the 'phil' nice and long."

4. "Where shall I begin?" coolly starts the head of the local planetarium, Dr. Carl deLawne Dyson. "These people, these simple farmers, they are taking what they don't understand and they are calling it witchery. This sort of unsubstantiated ignorance must be stamped out. There is no such thing as witches, plain and simple. We need to start working towards a future free from these backwards superstitions at whatever cost."

[b][anchor=537]#537[/anchor]: Summary Injustice [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
An anti-corruption case accusing a Constitutional Court Judge of abusing his power was recently dismissed without trial, because the same Constitutional Court Judge said that he was 'too tired to read the case notes'. After a week of bad press, the national ombudsman is demanding that you review the case personally, as it has become a cause célèbre within the legal community.

The Debate
1. "The system in place is a mockery of justice, beholden to the whims and corruptibility of individual judges," lectures Ombudsman @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is once again concerned with the plight of the common man. "The little guy doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell when one biased judge gets to decide everything! We simply must bring back trial by jury for all criminal cases, or else our legal system will be considered as hopelessly corrupt as Maxtopia's."

2. "Why would we ever trust legal judgment to the untrained and unwashed masses?" asks Justice @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ over tea and scones in his tower-shaped house, which appears to be made of ivory. "Only the legal elite are sufficiently educated to decide cases properly, especially on such complicated matters as criminal law. Uphold the decision of the Constitutional Court, and let me also sentence those annoying agitators for wasting the court's precious time with this nonsense."

3. "I'll admit it: unilateral judgement is a flawed system," observes Clotho Cerberus, one of the three Cerberus sisters, who is promptly interrupted by her sibling Lachesis Cerberus. "But I also acknowledge my sister's point that citizen juries lack the legal knowledge to make sound judgments." Atropos Cerberus then interrupts the other two siblings, "So why not have all courts run by a triumvirate of judges, with a two-to-one majority needed to impose sentences? That way, no one bad seed can corrupt the entire judiciary."

The Issue
Tragedy struck last Friday when police had to be called to a pop concert when the queue for the women's washroom devolved first into squabbles, then a violent free-for-all, as desperate female fans fought to get to the front.

The Debate
1. "Women being forced to wait is... is... just another form of sexism," complains @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a cross-legged concert-goer, with strained emphasis. "By forcing businesses and old stadiums to accommodate more… more… ah, people in women's washrooms, we can finally realise a fairer, more equal experience at the wash- SPEED IT UP, GRANS, SOME OF US HAVE GOT TO GO!"

2. "What a load of sh-" starts @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a controversial heavy metal singer, before being interrupted by the concert-goer elbowing her way past him with a desperate look on her face. "Look, if they don't like having to wait for the loo they can always bring their 'business' elsewhere. It's a free market. Nobody is forcing them folks to go there. One washroom for each gender. Fair is fair if fair is fair, am I right?"

3. "One washroom is fine, sweeties, but why all this fuss over artificial categories?" asks Mx. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, looking great in a fetching tuxedo and miniskirt combo. "Just take off the boy and girl signs on the doors, and be gender fluid about where you pass your fluids. Where would you be without me, darling?"

4. "Oh wow, I really feel for these girls!" says @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, one of the five singers from boy band 'The Unattended Gents', whose pop concert was so tumultuous. "It's our fault, for sure. I've written a song all about how sorry we are, and the gentle massage I'm gonna give those girls to make up for it. But hey, I know how we can fix this. Let's have every visit to the little lady's room cost 1 @@CURRENCY@@, then those queues will be a thing of the past. We can all be happy together, forever."

The Issue
Robotics giant Robot4U Inc. has caused an uproar in @@NAME@@ for its new product – Mindy The Android Wife. Budding 'android rights' activists and feminist groups have demanded the sale of such units be outlawed.

The Debate
1. "This revolting product sets gender equality back a century!" says noted feminist writer @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ as she signs copies of her latest book, Still Wild at 40. "It reflects a male obsession with having women slaving as housewives. Mindy is a docile patriarchal archetype that cooks, cleans, irons and has no true free will. This modern day misogynistic slavery is disgusting! The sale of Mindy units should be outlawed at once, and whatever units already sold should be seized, deactivated and thrown in a ditch somewhere!"

2. "Has anyone actually asked Mindy?" asks Brent Noonian Soong, CEO of Robot4U Inc, with several different Mindy models by his side. "I doubt any of these complainers and naggers have actually bothered to talk to her. Mindy is a realistic android that feels, learns, and knows how to have fun. Ask her yourself and Mindy will tell you how happy she is, won't you Mindy? We'll even give you one so you can show all of @@NAME@@ how dedicated Mindy is. Oh, and can you make android marriage legal? You'll never need to argue with your wife again. Mindy even comes with an off switch!"

3. "Unlike the misogynists over at Robot4U, we manufacture both androids and gynoids in all sexual orientations," replies @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, CEO of rival high-tech manufacturer CyberMirage Labs, seen holding hands with a male android. "Thanks to my fully functional boyfriend, Mark, every day I'm aware how hard things are for robots. Our androids won't be sold as slaves. Instead, they shall be free as and equal to any other @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@, just with purchasable upgrades to their... equipment. @@LEADER@@, let people love and marry whoever they want, be they human or automaton." The businesswoman then passionately kisses her android in front of everyone in the room.

4. "Robots… bah humbug!" sighs retiree @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ from his favorite park bench right outside your office. "We didn't need no newfangled robots when I was your age! We did all the hard work ourselves." He launches into a tirade of anecdotes and war stories, pausing only to feed some pigeons. Eventually, as you are about to leave, he gets to the point. "Anyways, if you want to be strong and sharp like my generation you young'uns need to eat your spinach and ban all those machines and technologies that are making you fat, lazy, and completely dependent!"
