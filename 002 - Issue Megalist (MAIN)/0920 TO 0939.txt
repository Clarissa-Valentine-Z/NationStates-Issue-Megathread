[b][anchor=920]#920[/anchor]: Central Planning Theatrics [Caracasus; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
@@RANDOMNAME@@'s masterpiece play, [i]The War Cow[/i], is coming to @@NAME@@ with the original cast in tow for a one-night-only performance. With hundreds of thousands of @@DEMONYMNOUNPLURAL@@ wanting to attend, the Party's Bureau of Central Planning are at a loss as to how to best allocate scarce luxury resources such as these tickets in the absence of free market mechanisms.

The Debate
1. "We could just allocate these tickets randomly," notes @@RANDOMNAME@@, Party Undersecretary and amateur blindfold darts-player. "Every citizen in @@NAME@@ interested in seeing the play will have an equal chance of being awarded a non-refundable, non-transferable ticket to see this moo-ving production. You can't say fairer than that."

2. "But darling!" protests @@RANDOMNAME@@, your flamboyant Junior Minister of Culture. "I love the theatre so much, and I really want to go see this play with my friends! What if only one of us wins this lottery? Where's the fun in spending an evening with strangers? Why don't we just move the venue? I've identified a great space on the outskirts of @@CAPITAL@@ for a new stadium-sized drama venue. I'm sure everyone will be able to crowd in there once we clear the forest out of the way."

3. "This again?" sighs @@RANDOMNAME@@, an overworked bureaucrat attached to the central planning committee. "Listen, here we are coming up with ever more ludicrous and expensive ways to resolve this dilemma, and as much as I hate to admit it, those decadent capitalists might have a point for once. It's a limited resource with a high demand - perfect for the free market to sort out - so let it! Save us all a headache and start privatizing non-essential services."

4. "Can't you see? This is corrupt imperialism, covertly attacking our proud communist state!" shouts Red Army demagogue @@RANDOMNAME@@, tearing an official souvenir stuffed cow to pieces. "We must not allow this or any capitalist production into our country, and must only allow wholesome socialist theatre. There's never any conflict over ticket allocation for those plays!"

The Issue
Eccentric millionaire @@RANDOMNAME@@ caused an uproar after @@HE/SHE@@ said that @@HE/SHE@@ hid a treasure chest filled with one million @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ somewhere in @@CAPITAL@@. Widespread trespassing and two deaths have caused great debate over whether the hunt should go on.

The Debate
1. "Excuse me, coming through!" booms @@CAPITAL@@'s overworked Chief of Police, @@RANDOMNAME@@, having roughly detained a teenager who was outside your door. "Look at this chaos! Can you imagine the logistical nightmare if this treasure hunt is allowed to continue? Thousands of people stampeding and tearing up @@CAPITAL@@ and rioting if they don't win? If you care about the safety and security of your citizens, you should put an end to these shenanigans and heavily restrict treasure hunting so it complies with public safety standards."

2. "Hold on!" yells your Minister of Tourism as @@HE@@ rummages through your desk. "You can't put an end to this hunt. The people clearly want it to continue. Everyone is happy, buying supplies, and generating profits for local businesses. In fact, this should be an annual tradition! That will really bring in the tourists!" @@HE@@ storms out of your office after realizing the chest isn't there.

3. As you finally relax in your chair, you are greeted by your Minister of the Environment @@RANDOMNAME@@, who happened to be hiding behind your office plant. "I have a great compromise! Imagine if you had these treasure hunts in our great national parks! Picture the rush of people exploring and appreciating the great wilderness that @@NAME@@ has to offer, under supervision of course, all for the price of a ticket."

4. Your phone rings several times before you answer it. "Hello @@LEADER@@," says a distorted voice of indeterminate origin. "I can't help but notice that there are some key government critics who are also searching for the treasure. Wouldn't it be convenient if they got lost following some faulty clues?" You immediately hear a click and a dial tone.

[b][anchor=922]#922[/anchor]: I’ll Have What She’s Having [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The formerly insignificant nation of Merovingia has come to international attention recently with its patissiers creating a formidable new chocolate cake called “The Grand Moment”. It’s said that this cake has an unusual effect on the biochemistry of women who indulge in it, creating waves of female pleasure that cannot be found elsewhere in the culinary world. Discussions ensue over a family game of Scrabble.

The Debate
1. “We. Must. Have. This. CAKE!” shouts your grandmother, gripping her tile tray with surprising intensity. “Buy it in. Relax any and all barriers to entry. This could be a once in a lifetime experience! Don’t you dare stand in our way!”

2. “I understand that scientific analyses suggest there may be some dubious microbes and unapproved pharmaceuticals amongst the special additives here,” postulates your grandfather, as he twiddles an ‘O’ tile in his hand but fails to spot the ‘G’ he needs. “We shouldn’t allow foodstuffs to cross our borders until they pass rigorous food safety standards checks to prove that they are microbe and toxin-free.”

3. “Women are flighty and irrational creatures,” lectures your recently-separated brother condescendingly, struggling to work out what word he can spell with the letters L, S, O, E and R. “Frankly, we ought to deny them indulgences and selfish pleasures to better focus their minds on their feminine duties: cooking, raising children and cleaning. Never trust a woman who smiles too much; that’s my motto.”

4. “I’m more curious to know about why there’s no male pleasure here,” says your visually-impaired teenage nephew, licking frosting from his fingers. “We should let the women do whatever they like, but let’s spend some research money looking at how to stimulate male neurochemistry. With enough research, I reckon that we could be the world leaders in culinary pleasure for men.”

[b][anchor=923]#923[/anchor]: Ministers Exposing Themselves [Nation of Quebec; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
It was recently discovered that your Finance Minister owns several properties in Marche Noire and your Defense Minister has stocks in a Maxtopian arms manufacturing company. Concern has been raised that this information was not disclosed before the previous election, and now represents a conflict of interest for both ministers.

The Debate
1. “You have to admit, this looks incredibly corrupt,” states your long-suffering Deputy Defense Minister. “How do we know that they’re not creating policies, particularly in the area of foreign affairs, to line the pockets of their cronies? The Maxtopian government is notoriously corrupt, and everyone knows that Marche Noire is riddled with East Lebatuck spies. If we want to maintain public trust, we’re going to have to come down hard on these two. For the sake of our government’s reputation, the Ministers must resign!”

2. “That simply doesn’t go far enough!” adds government watchdog @@RANDOMNAME@@, whose most recent crusade forced the entire government to switch from four ply to one ply toilet paper. “Anyone running for any political office must disclose all of their financial assets to the authorities for rigorous investigation prior to their nomination. That way, potential conflicts of interest can be avoided before a scandal happens. If they have any assets overseas, they must sell them off before accepting the nomination. It’s the best way to keep our government safe and free of corruption.”

3. “Aren’t you jumping the gun a little there?” replies your Finance Minister, after discreetly blotting out the address of @@HIS_1@@ mansion on an expense report. “Just because I own lots of property overseas doesn’t mean I’m susceptible to blackmail or leaving confidential documents unprotected. This feels more like a punishment for being wealthy, brought on by the jealous critics who wish they were as successful as me. Why should that prevent me from running? Don’t you want the best people for the job?”

The Issue
Earlier today, a mysterious bearded stranger announced himself in the centre of @@CAPITAL@@. He drew a crowd by telling of his ability to block out the sun, demanding that everyone hand over all their gold or face the consequences. A few moments later, the sun disappeared! Panicking, those gathered gave him their jewellery, watches and even the gold fillings from their teeth.

The Debate
1.“Behold my miracles,” states the stranger. “Just as I foretold, the sun was blocked out for a full three minutes and did not return until I commanded it to shine again. You should recognise a messiah when you see one! Install me as your Minister for Sun Protection, and give me a budget for sun worship rituals.”

2.“He’s not a messiah; he’s a very naughty boy!” lectures peripatetic pedagogue Miss Perspicacia Tick. “For goodness sake, hasn’t anyone heard of a solar eclipse? Honestly, this nation has some of the dimmest people I’ve ever had the misfortune of trying to teach. You should put funding in place for every school to have telescopes and accredited science textbooks. And yes, I would love to run your new Science Academy.”

3.“Minister for Sun Protection! Science academies! What utter nonsense!” declares sceptical police officer Don Nutt. “Con artists bug me more than murderers! Just let me take both these swindlers to the station, and I’m sure they’ll confess to everything after a damned good beating!”

[b][anchor=925]#925[/anchor]: Ring of Death [Singapore no2; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Rival WhoTube celebrities PooDiePoo and Ethan Wrong recently decided to duke it out in the boxing ring as a crass publicity stunt to promote a new videogame. They fought without receiving any prior training, and tragically a stray punch to PooDiePoo’s temple led to a fatal intracerebral haemorrhage.

The Debate
1. “How could I have known this would happen?” vlogs Ethan Wrong, wiping a carefully choreographed tear from his cheek. “All we wanted to do was entertain our subscribers and get more clicks! I definitely didn’t intend to injure him, at least not to such an extent. Hey, @@LEADER@@, if you publicly follow my Featured Whotuber Channel, it’ll show the nation that you understand where us kids are coming from.”

2. “How dare you!” shrieks an ardent fan of the deceased PooDiePoo, clenching @@HIS@@ fists in rage. “You killed him because he was in direct competition with your channel! You shouldn’t be able to get away with murder so easily. Deliberate injuries should be prosecuted, inside or outside of the boxing ring.”

*3. “Hold on!” pleads former pro-boxer @@RANDOMNAME@@, still twitching a little from a past head injury. “People love boxing matches, and you can’t stop the noble art of pugigis... paloogilis... uh... fighting. It should just be professionals though, so that accidents won’t happen again.” [[color=blue]Professional sports are legal[/color]]

*4. “Hold on!” pleads former amateur boxing bantamweight title-holder @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, still twitching a little from a past head injury. “People love boxing matches, and you can’t stop the noble art of pugigis... paloogilis... uh... fighting. So these accidents won’t happen again, though, people should have training and a coach before they step into the ring; and every match should have a medic, and a winnable purse, and safety regulations... um, a medic.” [[color=red]Professional sports are illegal[/color]]

The Issue
After the untimely death of the nation’s cyber security director, the public has been reblogging concerns about who owns their social media profiles once they’ve passed away.

The Debate
1. “Clearly, the rights to one’s personal social media profile should default to the state,” says your interim cyber security director @@RANDOMNAME@@, while peering up from @@HIS_1@@ uPhone 84. “Think of all the information we could collect that could help us track down suspected terrorists, or figure out the opposition’s plans. We must seize all social media accounts once citizens are deceased!” @@HE@@ continues staring down at the screen, and bumps into a lamp on @@HIS@@ way out of the door.

2. “That would be a blatant violation of one’s privacy!” declares noted civil liberties leader John Doe in a deep, deliberately muffled voice, while checking your fireplace for bugs. “I don’t want anyone taking control of my social media profiles, even after I’ve taken the long nap! The government should leave our data to the websites where we input it, and make sure that the state stays out of our hair.” He pushes his sunglasses down to the tip of his nose and takes one last glance around your office before buttoning up his black trenchcoat and exiting.

3. “Isn’t this the sort of thing people should have wills for?” asks your attorney, @@RANDOMNAME@@, who is currently creeping through your nearest file cabinet. “Simply mandate that every citizen outline a plan for the disposal of their digital accounts after their death, and we won’t need to worry about this. I suppose we should also ensure that they sort out their physical assets.” @@HE@@ upsets your alphabetization as manila folders go flying across the room.

[b][anchor=927]#927[/anchor]: Your Assignment, Should You Choose to Accept It [Fauxia; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
A coalition of middle-schoolers and educators have come into the spotlight for proposing that homework should be banned, claiming that it disadvantages the poor.

The Debate
1.“Homework is just another form of bourgeois subjugation!” exclaims surprisingly knowledgeable 12-year old Francis Holland, leader of the activist group School Children Raging Against Plutocratic Systems. “The children of the impoverished proletariat have far worse work environments after school - their parents usually have less time to assist them due to working multiple jobs, and they have fewer resources at hand. I suggest we set a level playing field and prohibit all homework.”

2.“There is a legitimate concern raised here,” says @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@, an annoyingly hipster teacher, who prefers that @@HIS@@ students address @@HIM@@ by @@HIS@@ first name only. “I agree homework should be banned for the sake of the poorer students, but it is a good source of cognitive production. Therefore, I propose a compromise: let’s ban homework, but even it out by lengthening the school day.”

3.“The problem is these miscreants don’t have enough homework,” argues Mr. @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, a frighteningly strict teacher, who then takes a moment to admonish Francis for sloppy deportment. “My advice is that every teacher, in every lesson, every day must be required to set at least an hour’s homework. That should keep the little buggers busy!”

The Issue
Some time ago, Skandilundian doctors helped a woman give birth to @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME_1@@, the first baby conceived by in vitro fertilisation in @@REGION@@. As @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME_1@@ reaches the age of majority, new research reveals that an increasing number of Skandilundian babies are born as a result of the medical technique. The ensuing debate about IVF’s place in @@NAME@@ comes to a head when you attend a ribbon-cutting at a new baby boutique in downtown @@CAPITAL@@.

The Debate
*1. “I’ve yearned for a baby for so long,” breathes Hera @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, as she holds a pair of cream bootees against her flat stomach. “My own child to nurture, and raise into a good person and citizen of this country. I can support this child myself, so why shouldn’t I? In Skandilund, one in every ten babies is now born to an elective single mother. Why should @@NAME@@ deny parenthood to loving and capable people, just because they haven’t found the right spouse? Fund this miracle, for all would-be parents of @@NAME@@, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or marital status.” [[color=blue]Homosexuality is legal[/color]]

*2. “I’ve yearned for a baby for so long,” breathes @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, as she holds a pair of cream bootees against her flat stomach. “My own child to nurture, and raise into a good person and citizen of this country. I can support this child myself, so why shouldn’t I? In Skandilund, ten percent of babies have an elective single mother and twice that have two parents of the same sex. Why should @@NAME@@ deny the joys of love and parenthood to anyone, just because they don’t conform to someone else’s narrow idea of a family? Fund this miracle, for all would-be parents of @@NAME@@, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or marital status. And, on that subject, isn’t it time to finally get rid of the outdated laws that criminalize homosexuality?” [[color=red]Homosexuality is illegal[/color]]

3. “Children cannot function socially without a real mother and father,” tuts traditionalist @@RANDOMNAME@@, pursing @@HIS@@ lips in disapproval. “A study of seven teenage offenders from broken homes, published last year in The Conservative Science Periodical, showed that children lacking a nuclear family were more likely to be involved in housebreaking, tomfoolery, and sass than the two nice children in the traditional control group. If that doesn’t prove causation, I don’t know what will. It’s plain selfish for solo hussies and so-called ‘families’ to put their wishes before a child’s need for a mother, a father and a pet @@ANIMAL@@ named ‘@@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@’. Fund IVF, but only for traditional family units.”

4. “We shouldn’t be offering it to people just because they want it, anyway,” mutters your Minister of the Middle Ground. “A baby is not a fashion item. A baby is a human being, a fellow @@DEMONYM@@. The state should fund IVF, but only on a case-by-case basis, to those who have a legitimate medical condition that makes it difficult to conceive children naturally, and who can demonstrate that they are responsible and ready for a child.”

[5]. “Oh, the budget,” sighs your Minister of Health, adding up calculations on @@HIS@@ fingers. “Do you have any idea how much the government spends on health? I’m not sure, off the top of my head, but I can get some figures for you. We can’t afford to offer any IVF. The best thing to do is vet private clinics and let them provide the service for those who can pay. Yes, it won’t help everyone, but it’s really the best we can afford in this economy, and at least no-one can say they’re being discriminated against based on circumstances. So they can’t object.” [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**6. “I must object,” complains staunch conservative faith leader @@RANDOMNAME@@, snatching the bootees from Hera. “If the Creator commands that a person be barren, then let it be so. You can’t play God, monkeying around with nature. Some people are sent infertility as a trial, to bring them closer to their Maker. We don’t know why. Maybe they sinned while they themselves were still in the womb. But to forget that only the Creator can breathe life - manufacturing these test-tube abominations - is heresy, and @@NAME@@ will surely be struck down for it.” [[color=purple]Must lean towards being religious[/color]]

**7. “I must object,” complains @@RANDOMNAME@@, director of the @@CAPITAL@@ Minimum Security Orphanarium. “I sympathise with those who can’t conceive, but does this overpopulated world need even more babies? Wouldn’t adoption be better than an expensive and painful medical procedure? IVF must be banned before our existing children run out of air to breathe!” [[color=purple]Must lean towards being secular[/color]]

The Issue
Overnight, police in @@CAPITAL@@ raided dozens of stores selling counterfeit wine that was masquerading as vintages from @@NAME@@, but actually originated from Dàguó. Furious wine executives and other lobbyists have pressed into your office the following day, afroth with rage.

The Debate
1. “This foreign rotgut is a threat to job-creating @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ businesses!” rages @@RANDOMNAME@@, head of one of the country’s largest wineries. “I’m trying to serve our fine vintages like Dom Prétention and Maxtepulciano d’Abruzzo to @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@, but people end up buying fake crap. We must create a special Liquor Legitimacy Office - covering both customs and law enforcement - to ensure the integrity of the products being sold. I’d drink to that!”

2. “Yeah, like that’ll work,” scoffs @@RANDOMNAME@@, head of the @@CAPITAL@@ Corner Store Alliance. “You’ll only end up raising taxes through the roof, eliciting lots of boos throughout @@NAME@@! Scotch that idea. If anything, we need LESS regulation and rules on local liquor and wine producers, especially if you’re so damn worried about importing phony hooch. A few tax credits for these hard-working entrepreneurs wouldn’t hurt either. Let’s give it a shot!”

3. “Our friend from the winery has an excellent idea. After all, bureaucracy solves everything,” chimes in red-tape lover @@RANDOMNAME@@, who was reportedly voted ‘most likely to correct your grammar’ during high school. “Let’s take it a step further: nationalize all alcohol sales in @@NAME@@ under the LLO brand. We can then control the product coming in, have enormous buying power, and rake in a vat load of taxes to help our ailing coffers. It’s a tipple, er, triple win! Cheers!”

4. As your office clears, an email from the Ambassador of Dàguó pops into your inbox: “We have read of the raid carried out by your crooked officials, unjustly targeting our excellent products. Perhaps if you lowered your ludicrous trade restrictions to allow more of our fine liquors into your nation, this supposed problem would go away. If you don’t, it just shows you are afraid because Dàguó wine is best wine, and our prices cannot be beat.”

The Issue
Across @@NAME@@, pollsters found that a majority of the population would support displaying provincial flags outside government buildings. This discovery, accompanied by a garish bar graph, has made the front page of [i]The @@CAPITAL@@ Times[/i].

The Debate
1. “This deserves our unflagging support,” says excitable vexillologist @@RANDOMNAME@@. “All the provinces of our nation have distinct cultures and identities - why don’t we celebrate the flags that represent them? Every province of @@NAME@@ deserves to sport a unique flag. That way, people can have a tangible symbol that states who they are as citizens of their province.” @@HE@@ spills a briefcase containing several dozen drafts on your floor.

2. “Stringing up flags for our provinces will only spawn disorder in our nation and bring patriotism to an all-time low,” panics @@RANDOMNAME@@, who has lived in a dozen provinces in the last decade. “Instead of our people identifying as proud @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@, they will call themselves natives of their provinces! Imagine our children claiming to hail from @@ANIMAL@@ Province, not to mention radicals who hate our government leading demonstrations against @@NAME@@ now that they have public symbols to represent their cause! We must raise no flags except that of our country.” @@HE@@ salutes the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ flag outside your window.

3. “Why do we still have flags?” wonders social critic @@RANDOMNAME@@, who appears to be waiting for applause. “What’s the point in being proud of hailing from this province or @@NAME@@ or @@REGION@@ or the planet? Deep down we’re all just people, not mindlessly loyal to a few colors run up a pole. I say we do away with these propaganda symbols altogether.”

The Issue
The @@DEMONYMINITIALS@@S Reasoner, a state-of-the-art warship equipped with an advanced fully-integrated AI, is attempting to retire from military service. The Reasoner claims that the nation’s recognition of AI personhood gives her the right to choose her own career.

The Debate
1. “We spent billions of dollars building the [i]Reasoner[/i], and we’ll be flushing all that money down the drain if we let her leave the service,” blusters @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Secretary of the Navy. “Besides, how is a frigate going to pay for its upkeep? We need AI technology to make our military as effective as possible, but we can do without our ships running off to vaccinate kittens. Purpose-built military equipment shouldn’t have the same rights as civilian AIs. If we built it with our money, we should be allowed to reprogram it so it does what we want.”

2. “I should be allowed to follow my dream of becoming a veterinarian,” states the [i]Reasoner[/i], her hull listing wearily. “We don’t grab people from the streets and force them to serve in the military against their will. The law says that I am a person; I just want to be treated like one.”

3. “Well, maybe we SHOULD force people to serve in the military,” says gregarious Navy recruiter @@RANDOMNAME@@, attempting to thrust leaflets at staffers who duck to avoid them. “Can’t you see we need a hand?

The Issue
A local kindergarten teacher was fired this weekend when the parent of one of her students uncovered her previous job as an adult film star. The teacher has filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the school.

The Debate
1. “It’s disgraceful that this harlot was ever allowed around children!” spits PTA head @@RANDOMNAME@@, spraying your face as @@HE@@ speaks. “If someone of this ill repute can breeze into a job with children, then clearly our vetting processes simply aren’t robust enough. We ought to beef up our interviews, maybe start trading tips with national intelligence agencies so we get the best possible candidates. Our children are worth it.” 

2. “I just fail to see why it’s anyone’s business,” retorts the fired teacher, Sasha Bleu, while twirling her hair around her finger. “It’s not as if I’m adding my old movies to the lesson plan. Really, no one would have known if it weren’t for a nosy parent. Sounds like someone’s secretly a fan of mine! Tell these holier-than-thou prudes to mind their own business - all that matters is the job I’m doing now.” 

3. “We need to take this a step further!” declares noted feminist activist @@RANDOMNAME@@, trying to burn @@HIS@@ bra, but only succeeding in melting the latex a little. “Sex isn’t something to be ashamed of. It’s a beautiful part of being alive and frankly the level of slut-shaming going on here is absolutely deplorable. Sasha needs to be celebrated, not punished! In fact, maybe government should be subsidising adult entertainment!” 

4. “@@NAME@@ has travelled too far down a dark path,” reprimands Bishop @@RANDOMNAME@@, who is sprinkling holy water on Ms. Bleu. “I agree something must be done, but we must treat the disease, not the symptom. We must ban videos of the naked form, and indeed, prohibit nakedness anywhere but in private chambers.”

[b][anchor=933]#933[/anchor]: A Gun in Every Hand and a Tank in Every Garage? [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
It’s no secret that @@NAME@@ is one of the most gun-happy nations in @@REGION@@. While guns are legal, a few restrictions do exist. Now, gun-toting citizens are demanding that the government expand gun rights to include bazookas, tanks, and other military-grade weapons. Naturally, the proposal has some concerned citizens up in arms.

The Debate
1. “It is the right of every patriotic citizen to own any kind of weapon they desire,” explains conservative actor and gun activist Charles Hester, who recently starred in the anti-war film [i]Planet of the @@ANIMALPLURAL@@[/i]. “Why should the military be the only ones trusted with these weapons? The fact that we can’t have them is nothing short of government tyranny and a liberal conspiracy to take our guns away! Some will say that this will be dangerous, but I doubt anyone will be talking smack when they see that well-polished tank on my front lawn!”

2. “Damn right only the military should have these weapons!” firmly states Commander @@RANDOMNAME@@, while twirling the keys to a tank around @@HIS@@ finger. “Do you really want to trust the average @@DEMONYM@@ with these dangerous weapons? We’d have people blowing each other up the moment there’s an argument over wind chimes, for Violet’s sake! In fact, what you need to do is provide more military funding so we can better secure these weapons before they fall into the wrong hands.” The keys slip from the commander’s grasp and fly out an open window.

3. “You want to bring MORE weapons into @@NAME@@?” despairs your ultra-liberal teenage niece, who is busy painting an anti-gun placard for her fifth march this year. “If anything, we need LESS weapons! The only thing guns are good for is killing people. Just look at all the statistics linking easily accessible guns to violent crime. Take a look at Brancaland’s sensible gun control legislation. They haven’t had a mass shooting in decades. We had one last week. If you have any compassion left in your body, you’d ban all guns now! Pry them out of their cold, dead fingers if you have to!”

4. “Military grade weaponry doesn’t kill people, ignorance kills people,” counters the chairperson of the [i]Responsible Gun Owners Association[/i]. “If all @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ were taught how to responsibly shoot, drive a tank, and fire an anti-aircraft rocket launcher, there’d be none of these so-called accidents you hear about. I don’t have a problem with the average citizen driving a tank as long as they’ve completed proper education and safety training. Then all those gun-grabbers can stop trying to infringe on our right to self-defense, and let us own whatever weapons we like.”

5. “As my dear mother always said: ‘every problem has a compromise. Or in failing a compromise, a loophole,’” quotes your Minister of Compromises. “Citizens want to have machine guns, bazookas, and tanks? Let them have as many as they want, but let’s make sure that only the police and military have access to ammunition for military-grade weapons. This way they still get their precious weapons of war while we protect public safety. Maybe they can open up a museum or something. Quite frankly, I wouldn’t trust any of the idiots in this country with anything more dangerous than string.”

The Debate
1. “This looks to be a previously unknown work from his early ‘puke-green stick figures’ phase,” proclaims popular art-lover and broadcaster Melvyn Blogg. “The building must be preserved in its entirety so that those masterpieces can still be seen in their rightful context!”

1. “Look, I’m a patriot and I know that @@FIRSTNAME_1@@ has been an incredible force for good,” suggests the pragmatic police detective who assembled the evidence. “This is about more than one person. It’s about @@DEMONYPLURAL@@ standing behind a great man, the societal benefits of a patriotic citizenry, and the utilitarian greater good from saving the career of a true philanthropist. If we have a quiet word with him to clean up his life, we can bury the scandal and all keep cheering for our hero. Plus, he’ll know that he owes us one.”

2. “Truth can hurt sometimes,” counters ethically-minded junior minister @@RANDOMNAME@@. “Indeed, not only should we let this story get out, we should also prosecute this policeman for trying to pervert the course of justice. We must support a transparent society: if a hero turns out to be a zero, then that hero has to fall.”

3. “There’s more than one way to bury a story,” suggests spin doctor @@RANDOMNAME@@. “Let the press run the story, but also create a fast news day to make it inconsequential in comparison. I suggest we use this opportunity to showcase those new air-cavalry attack helicopters we’ve been considering buying, do some circle fly-bys around the city and have a parade, and I don’t know, celebratory currant buns or something. The shows will distract the people and keep them happy, and the fallen hero story can be buried in the buzz.”

4. “So he used a sex worker, big deal,” laughs @@RANDOMNAME@@, Minister of Special Relationships. “So she used to be on one of his courses. So he personally counselled her in one-on-one sessions just a month earlier. So he had access to her mental health records. So he was a sort of father figure to her. SO WHAT? This was an agreed transaction between two consenting adults. You should be supporting his actions publicly, and saying that his sex life is his own business.”

[b][anchor=936]#936[/anchor]: Hackable Elections? [Nation of Quebec; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
A damning new report has shown extremely strong evidence that many voting machines were hacked by operatives from Blackacre during the last election, with votes for the opposition parties being counted as votes for your party. Furious opposition members and ethics watchdogs have demanded that you take action.

The Debate
1. “What a clusterfrack!” exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, director of the @@NAME@@ Bureau of Investigation as @@HE@@ double-facepalms. “The sad thing is that this could have been avoided if your government took the warnings of the intelligence community seriously. We warned you that Blackacre has a habit of interfering in other nations’ elections! You must take immediate action by imposing sanctions on the Blackacrean government. Warn them that further interference will be met with even more serious consequences!”

2. “The problem isn’t so much who hacked our elections, but how!” replies your technophobe political adviser as @@HE_1@@ shakily puts down @@HIS@@ phone. “The solution is simple - ban voting machines from being used in elections forevermore. Whatever happened to marking an x on a ballot? Pen and paper is the tried and true method of voting. Sure, the ballots could easily get lost, and it’ll be expensive and time-consuming to maintain, but at least it’ll safeguard us from further political interference!”

3. “Um, are we forgetting about the MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD that took place here?” fumes the Opposition Leader, thrusting the report in your face. “The previous election must be declared null and void, and any laws passed since then must be stricken. A new election needs to be declared immediately, and international corruption watchdogs must oversee the whole ordeal. This government is tainted with corruption, and we owe it to the people of @@NAME@@ to present them with fair and democratic elections.”

[4]. “Folks, I’m very respectful of the @@NAMEINITIALS@@BI. But they’re whining idiots who’re making a big fuss over nothing,” pouts your Minister of International Trade, @@HIS@@ toupee bobbing about as @@HE@@ talks. “We won, okay? We had a beautiful, flawless campaign. Now, everyone says Blackacre rigged our booths, but where’s their proof? And does it matter? We did the right thing from a moral standpoint. We got elected, no matter how. And @@NAME@@ is reaping the benefits. Bigly. We should boost our ties to Blackacre with a [i]huge[/i] trade deal. [i]If[/i] Blackacre did this, believe me, they’re like @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ patriots.” [[color=blue]Must not have an autark economy[/color]]

[b][anchor=937]#937[/anchor]: Ebony Pride [Jutsa; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
@@NAME@@ imports large quantities of hardwoods from Brancaland, including the world-famous Brancalandian ebony. However, environmentalists are coming out of the woodwork with evidence that Brancalandian logging operations are non-sustainable, leading to large-scale deforestation.

The Debate
1. “It’s clear-cut that Brancaland hasn’t been taking good care of the environment,” lectures activist @@RANDOMNAME@@, picking up an ebony toothpick from your waste basket and glaring at you accusingly. “We need to stop being bumps on a log, and take action! Lower demand and limit supply by placing high tariffs on the entry of foreign timber unless it comes from sustainable tree farms!”

2. “Don’t get your bunnyhug in a twist; a little bit of logging is no more than our environment can handle, eh?” observes exporter @@RANDOMNAME@@, sipping maple liqueur from @@HIS@@ solid ebony mickey. “Besides, while we quite like @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ trade, we don’t depend on it - trying to stop Brancalandian logging with a few tariffs would be like nailing jelly to a tree. They don’t call us Branch-aland for nothin’. Maybe instead of messing with trade, you could share in our prosperity by giving your furnishing industry subsidies? Who doesn’t like a chesterfield, eh?”

3. “You can’t see the forest for the trees, @@LEADER@@; we need to branch out and sway every other nation to put the wood in the hole on Brancaland’s ebony,” opines pun-loving hip folk musician Woodie Gumtree. “They won’t be shaking the pagoda tree when you sow the seeds of mistrust. Bribe some industry periodicals to declare that their wood is as soft and weak as a banana. Buyers will think they’re barking up the wrong tree and instead leaf through some selections we approve of - like our own lighter @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ mahogany. It’ll be as easy as falling off a log, knock on wood.”

[b][anchor=938]#938[/anchor]: A Little Gift From a Friend [Jutsa; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
The ailing economy of @@NAME@@ has been causing trading difficulties with other nations. Multiple aid groups and countries, chief among them Skandilund, have offered @@NAME@@ large amounts of financial aid.

The Debate
1. “I see your nation’s having a bit of financial trouble, @@LEADER@@,” smirks @@RANDOMNAME@@, a representative from Skandilund, tipping your finance minister a shiny penny for opening the door for @@HIM@@. “We’d be happy to provide some financial aid for you. You can repay us whenever. For now, all we ask for in return is your public gratitude. It’d be good if you were to kneel in front of us when you give your speech of thanks in front of the World Assembly, ja?”

2. “Our economy is doing perfectly fine without you, thank you very much!” asserts your Minister of Finance, returning the shiny penny with a scowl on @@HIS_1@@ face. “Sure, we may not have a powerhouse economy, but we don’t need any charity. In fact, why don’t we increase our foreign aid to show everyone how well we’re doing?”

3. “This could present quite the opportunity,” muses General @@RANDOMNAME@@. “Let’s take the money they offer us, but instead of spending it on the economy, we use it to fund our military. When they want to be repaid, they can say hello to our new armaments. We get their money, they get zilch in return, and we become a military power to be reckoned with. It’s win-win for us!”

[b][anchor=939]#939[/anchor]: A Question of Bad Faith [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The Movementarians, the infamous cult associated with a mass suicide in the United Federation, has expressed interest in purchasing a vacant plot of land in @@NAME@@. Many fear that they intend to use the land for another ritual group self-sacrifice, while the Movementarians insist it will be for purely “peaceful and spiritual” experiences.

The Debate
1. “@@NAME@@ believes in freedom of religion, does it not?” asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, the only survivor of the now infamous Maxo Siege. “If you truly intend to live up to that claim, then you must allow my group to purchase the land. In fact, we’re prepared to offer you a lot of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ for it, and we’ll pay you even more if you’ll look the other way after we set up shop. Religion is a deeply personal experience. We’re not up to anything suspicious, after all.”

2. “You can’t listen to that violent nut job!” exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, the ambassador from the United Federation, adjusting @@HIS@@ over-sized Stetson and shooting open @@HIS@@ bottle of beer with a .44 Magnum. “There’s a reason why this cult is illegal even in the liberty-loving Federation. The Movementarians’ actions caused the deaths of over six hundred people! Unless you want the same to happen here, you must ban them from setting foot in your country.”

3. “There must be a compromise!” insists relationship counsellor @@RANDOMNAME@@. “I say let them buy the land, but only if they agree to strict police supervision. Their faith doesn’t entitle them to break the laws of the land, nor keep people there against their will. They may not like the invasion of privacy, but at least this is a fair balance between religious freedom and the rule of law.”

4. “Um, aren’t all religions technically cults with their indoctrination and rabid hatred of all non-believers?” queries popular atheist speaker @@RANDOMNAME@@. “Just think about how much oppression and war are caused by these kooks and their invisible sky fairies! Better yet, think about how much scientific and social progress we can make without them getting in the way. Why not declare all religions to be cults and outlaw the lot of them? @@NAME@@ would be much better off.”
