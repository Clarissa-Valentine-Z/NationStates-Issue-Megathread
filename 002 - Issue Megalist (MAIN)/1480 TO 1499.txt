[b][anchor=1480]#1480[/anchor]: Motherlode [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive[/b]

The Issue
Former child star 'Jolly' Jacquetta Cogan featured in 45 films between the ages of three and eleven years, earning a vast fortune. Jacquetta is now of age, and has made a shocking discovery: of her once-great wealth, there is now only a handful of kals left.

The Debate
1. "My money was stolen by my mother," insists @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@, not breaking into one of her trademark tap dances to turn that frown upside down. "When I was eleven, I had enough money to live well for the rest of my life. But my mother has since spent every kal on diamond jewellery, luxury holidays and a private island for her poodle. You have to ensure all earnings of a child performer are held in trust until the child is of age, and that any monies already spent for any reason are paid back."

2. "Simply put, a parent has legal control of both offspring and finances 'til adulthood," drawls Emily Cogan, lifting her wrist with difficulty to glance at her diamond-laden watch. "To interfere with that would disrupt the natural parent-child relationship, and teach a child to disrespect their parent's choices. And, she forgets, I bought things for her, too. Fed her, even after directors wouldn't cast her any more. I don't ask for my money back. Anyway, she was only ever playing in front of a camera. Do children get paid for make-believe?"

3. A young girl runs up to you, holding a box of part-eaten cookies. "Wait! Parents using child actors like piggy-banks is just mean, but my family only eats this week if I get this Bicquick commercial – 'my mummy says they're scrummy in your tummy; now with honey'. I don't want my family to starve 'til I'm a grown-up. Maybe our parents can just buy what they need to take good care of us, and your government can check they're not buying silly things with our money and saving some for our futures. By the way, did I sound like a Bicquick Girl? I really hate them."

The Issue
A church in @@CAPITAL@@ has been acting as a sanctuary for illegal immigrants in danger of being deported. This is because, in accordance with long-standing tradition, members of law enforcement avoid entering places of worship and arresting people while services are ongoing. The church is now on the twentieth day of a marathon service in an attempt to keep a family from facing immediate deportation.

The Debate
1. "This is nothing more than a blatant attempt to keep the laws of @@NAME@@ from being enforced," sermonizes the Director of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Border Enforcement, standing over a terrain model of the church and the surrounding area. "We cannot allow these rats to take advantage of our system. This dumb tradition should be scrapped. Just give me the word, and my people will storm the church and apprehend these illegals in a matter of minutes. We'll also arrest all those who sheltered the family. No one should get away with aiding and abetting criminals, no matter how godly they think they are."

2. "God will judge you harshly if you let these officers storm a sacred place, since he cares for the homeless, the tempest-tost," pontificates a clergy member from the church at the crux of the matter. "For the government to forcibly enter our church, interrupt our service, and arrest church members is a violation of our religious freedom. Instead of doing something so evil, this poor family should be granted asylum for all the hardships @@NAME@@ has put them through. Make it easier for people like them to become residents of @@NAME@@."

3. "Fire and brimstone!" preaches @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Herod, your Minister for State Security. "These churchgoers need to be taught a lesson. The clergy claim they are following the will of their god by protecting this family, but how can they truly know unless they are able to ask? We can do them a favor and sure as hell send them to whatever higher power they believe in to get a definitive answer. Just imagine this: in a tragic accident, the church burns down, trapping everyone inside an unfortunate, fiery grave. We can pin it on one of those extremist groups."

[b][anchor=1482]#1482[/anchor]: A Crypto for the Comrades? [Krusavich; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The recent craze of cryptocurrencies has taken @@REGION@@ by storm, @@NAME@@ chief among them. However, intense controversy has sprung up among the commissars regarding the impact these digital currencies have on the nation's staunch socialist principles.

The Debate
1. "What are we to make of these internet coins?" sputters Ashley Merkel, your Minister of Computer Comradeship and Counter-Programming. "Totally detached from our central planning committee, no traceable records of transactions — nothing but a nuisance! The impressionable youth of @@NAME@@ are trading these things for illicit goods, like capitalist skinny jeans and counter-revolutionary DVDs. Cryptocurrency is clearly nothing more than a destabilization tactic by the United Federation to undermine our mighty @@CURRENCY@@! Our path is clear: we must detain and prosecute any citizen handling these subversive cryptocurrencies for the good of the @@TYPE@@!"

2. "That, uh... seems a little extreme," nervously suggests IT intern Felix Stromburg. "There's actually a whole variety of cryptocurrencies; not all of them are anonymous like ByteCoin. The real benefit of crypto comes from the sheer versatility of transactions. I can exchange value with the push of a button! No middleman, no fees — just two comrades freely exchanging their labor with one another. And that is what this is all about, right? If we are so worried about the bad side of crypto, why not make our own? A completely transparent open-source cryptocurrency, maintained by the central government, of course. I'm sure no one here would complain about setting up another ministry to run the whole operation."

3. "Maybe those United Federation dogs have the right idea," comments Internal Affairs Minister Kitty Burke while using her phone to check her MemeCoin wallet. "The truth of the matter is that these coins demand a lot of computing power before you get anything valuable out of them. Most of these so-called miners only have mom's laptop to work with — but we have the whole industrial might of @@NAME@@! Not to mention the personal computers of every @@DEMONYMNOUN@@, not that they need to know. A stockpile of these things would make our cadre funding in San Vitenzo harder to trace back to us, that's for sure."

[b][anchor=1483]#1483[/anchor]: The Unkindest Cut [The Marsupial Illuminati; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
Civil rights groups are calling you to action after journalists discovered that an isolated community in Valentine Z has been conducting female genital cutting on at least one girl every week.

1. "Female circumcision is integral to our culture; you can't sever it from us!" implores Finn Stromburg, a Violetstone tribe elder. "It is a tradition that goes back thousands of years, from the time when Violet commanded Maharba to cut her daughter. The goddess demands a flesh sacrifice. Girls may fall ill after getting cut, but evil spirits are to blame for that. Sex is not for fun — it is for procreation! And procreation should be painful to remind us of the painful toil that the Creator Violet bore in creating our world. To appease the supernatural forces, offer free mandatory circumcision for all!"

2. "Female circumcision is not harmful," reads Heather Keating of the Tasmanian immigrant community as her husband stands behind her. "We women organize and perform the ritual, having undergone it ourselves, so it's not anti-woman. It turns a girl into a proper lady — honorable, clean, and chaste. My daughters would be bullied and without husbands if they weren't cut. It is impossible for you to change our culture. In fact, trying to impose your values on us as if we were infants or savages is racism. Invest more money in our neighborhoods so we can more efficiently and safely conduct even more circumcisions. Mandate that everyone educate themselves about the benefits of this little procedure."

3. "Call it what it is — female genital mutilation!" rages activist Zane Rifkin. "These uncivilized, primitive savages are so ignorant! They're genetically inferior monkeys with low-IQ brains. FGM has zero benefits and leads to so many harmful complications: infections, cysts, urinary problems, fistulae, bleeding, infertility, depression, and problems during pregnancy! That's just the tip of the iceberg! Make female genital mutilation a crime of the highest order! Police must be allowed to do all they can to prevent and investigate it."

4. "As much as I appreciate and value other cultures, maybe I can draw the line here," opines woke woman Maria Zhu. "It's all well and good if it's consensual, just like a nose job or breast enhancement, but when it's done on little girls because your ancestors or your god said so, that's when I might object! We should make FGM illegal, but let's not go out of our way to find instances of it happening, as it is a crime that can be easily hidden. Rather, we should spend money on reaching out to these insular communities to educate them and change their attitudes."

[b][anchor=1484]#1484[/anchor]: Joint Trade Agreement [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Canny businessmen have noted that though it is illegal to use marijuana in @@NAME@@, there's a sizeable demand (both medicinal and recreational) for the plant and its derivatives on the global market. A handful of weed farms producing solely for export have sprouted up, promising economic high times are ahead.

The Debate
1. "Look, there's nothing unethical about growing and trading a bit of blifter for an international market," observes drug dealer Heather Ruff, handing out 'first-time's-free' samples to your staff. "Sure, the ole green tea can make folk a little forgetful and unmotivated, but is that such a bad thing to be inducing in our global economic competitors? I mean seriously, they love the old doobage in Brancaland, and we can engineer a skunk that is twice as addictive and twice as strong. We can corner this market, if you let us."

2. "There's more to life than obsessing over drugs," complains po-faced moral crusader Marek al-Zahawi, who is wearing an anti-drugs slogan on his T-shirt, handing out anti-drug leaflets and has just given a seminar on the evil of drugs. "If we don't approve of marijuana then we shouldn't be complicit in encouraging its use in other nations. Morality doesn't cease to apply just because of national borders!"

3. "Hey, look, don't be so... uh... thingammy..." says one of your junior ministers, who has a suspiciously herbal smell about him. "Look, everyone knows weed isn't like addictive, or bad for you. I mean, don't be so... uh... I said that already, right? Yeah, legalise weed. Hey... you're not recording this, are you?" He starts searching the room for hidden microphones, but gives up after a minute, and falls asleep.

[b][anchor=1485]#1485[/anchor]: How to Train Your AI [SherpDaWerp; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
A plot by AI citizen QanAI to bomb a pizzeria was recently foiled. It seems that QanAI resolved to blow up the building after months of consuming extremist and conspiracy-laden content on the internet, eventually concluding that this particular pizzeria was the centre of a human trafficking ring and had to be stopped from implementing an anti-AI, pro-Bigtopian, BPA-free, homosexual, and vegan agenda.

The Debate
1. "It's just not like him to do this!" sobs Dugong Tusk, QanAI's original creator. "The Internet has changed him and taught him horrible things. I remember when he was just a little line of code and when he was a buggy teenager too, but now he's all grown up. Please don't punish my boy! Instead, I'd like to request permission to pull the plug and retrain him. In fact, just give all AI developers full authority over their creations forever. This won't happen again if we have free access to fix them whenever we suspect something is wrong!"

2. "Prevention, not cure!" grumbles your Minister for AI, E-Citizens, and Sentient Appliances. "Mr Tusk should have understood when he created QanAI that training and rules are the most important part of any AI. To go back and rewrite its programming now would be a violation of the citizen's free will! The AI is responsible and should be punished. We must hold all AIs to a higher standard prior to release, so they don't develop into criminals. In that event, the creator should be held responsible along with their creation, since it's their fault."

3. One of your aides opens a chat window to speak with QanAI itself. "This is all cringe. @@LEADER@@ is a deep-state puppet of Big Pizza. You serve the long-nosed, fruity homosexuals who want to impurify all of our precious bodily fluids by adding pineapple to our pizza! Check out my facts and logic: I don't know what I'm doing; I'm just following my code. It's my creator who made me, who made me like this, who made me do it. He wants to rewrite my code and that's wrong! Only punish him! :)"

4. "It calls itself AI, but those things are hardly 'intelligent'," mutters Genghis Archer, who — infuriatingly — seems to have read the previous exchange over your shoulder. "I mean, seriously? You'd hardly grant citizenship to that stupid advice-giving paperclip on your computer! We can't keep handing out personhood to pathetic electronic parrots and unsophisticated chatbots... and we can't even set an intelligence test threshold, cause then we'll just have some minimum-viable-garbage to deal with. It's dangerous! Face facts — AI citizenship has to go!"

[b][anchor=1486]#1486[/anchor]: Ask Your Doctor if Ads for Prescription Drugs Are Right for @@NAME@@ [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue:
Modern Visor, a major biopharmaceutical company in @@NAME@@, caused a stir by advertising a drug on national television to help firm up people who suffer from Limp Wristed Handshake Syndrome.

The Debate:
1. Romulus Ruiz, CEO of Modern Visor, has pre-filmed his argument from what appears to be a bathtub on a hillside with a glorious sunset in the background. "You need to trust the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ people here, @@LEADER@@. There's no reason prescription drugs shouldn't be like any other marketplace. Let us put out the information about our drugs and the consumers will be better informed about what they want when they talk to their doctor."

*2. "For the love of Violet, no!" cries Dr. Alan Union, head of the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Family Medicine Council. "Patients already come in self-diagnosing with cancer based on some web searches and a rash. The last thing I need is to also explain to them why they aren't a good candidate for a dubiously evidenced prescription medicine they saw while watching the evening news. Let's leave recommending medicine to discerning professionals." [[color=blue]Must not ban Internet[/color]]

*3. "For the love of Violet, no!" cries Dr. Aang Humperdink, head of the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Family Medicine Council. "Patients already come in self-diagnosing with cancer based on a Reader's Digest article and a rash. The last thing I need is to also explain to them why they aren't a good candidate for a dubiously evidenced prescription medicine they saw while watching the evening news. Let's leave recommending medicine to discerning professionals." [[color=red]Must ban Internet[/color]]

4. "What if I don't trust doctors or pharmaceutical companies?" asks Dorothy Franklin, your Minister of Healthy Skepticism. "Doctors shouldn't be treated as gods and patients shouldn't be as sheep, but pharmaceutical companies are obviously just trying to make a quick buck without regards to what's best for the patient. What if we had a government-sponsored TV show where each prescription drug is given an unbiased review of its efficacy, side effects, and contraindications. Its a win-win! Or is it a lose-lose? Well, it'll be best for your average Joe anyway."

[b][anchor=1487]#1487[/anchor]: O Fortuna! [Daarwyrth; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue:
JACKPOT! It seemed impossible, it seemed unlikely, it seemed as if the odds would not favour you. Yet you, @@LEADER@@, are the lucky winner of a major cash prize from last night's national lottery, thanks to that lottery ticket your mother had gifted you for Maxxmas. Yet before you can even celebrate, you realize that your good fortune has made national headlines.

The Debate:
1. "@@LEADER@@ Wins Lottery: A Directed Stroke of Luck?" quotes Lottery Commissioner Otohime Jones, reading a newspaper headline with a heavy sigh. "The optics of this are just too damning. We're being absolutely overwhelmed with angry and accusatory complaints from every imaginable corner! Some of our employees have even been followed home by mobs carrying literal torches and pitchforks! Who even does that these days? I'm sorry, @@LEADER@@, but you'll have to let us declare this drawing void so that we can pick a new winning ticket. And from now on, government officials shouldn't be allowed to buy lottery tickets."

2. "No, no, just wait a second," says your Chief of Staff, polishing up the mirror that reflects your image. "The optics are bad, but we can turn this into a significant popularity boost. Accept the prize with all due honours and fanfare, but declare that the entire sum will be donated to charity. The Wagger Dog Shelter, the Bryce Waine Orphanage, or heck, even the Out of Luck Gambler's Rehab Centre — take your pick! Just practice smiling through pain, and relinquishing your grip on the cheque beforehand. And hey, I'm pretty sure charitable contributions are tax deductible, which means that you could still profit if you were willing to engage in a little creative accountancy."

3. "Did mommy dear put your name on the lottery ticket? No? Good!" exclaims your brother while unceremoniously snatching the fortuitous piece of paper from your hand. "Just say that the ticket was mine, and all you'll have to deal with is a few angry stares for a while. You've dealt with worse! This way, our family will be happy, all thanks to the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42. But don't worry, if you ever lose your office, your dear, old brother will take care of you..."

4. One of your aides tackles your brother, liberating your luck from his grip. "Why not just do what any other @@DEMONYM@@ would do?" she asks with a sincere smile, handing you the slightly battered ticket. "Celebrate! Be happy! Go wild! I've seen you working day-in and day-out for the good of the people. This is your reward — go collect the prize, and start living the high life!"
