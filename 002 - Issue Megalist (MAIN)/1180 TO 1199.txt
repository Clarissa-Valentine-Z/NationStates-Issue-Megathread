[b][anchor=1180]#1180[/anchor]: Death Doesn't Discriminate [Jutsa; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
The working population has become more difficult to sustain since many laborers have been selected for the rite of human sacrifice.

The Debate
*1. "Only the elderly must be sacrificed," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, keeping vigil at @@HIS@@ grandfather's deathbed. "Our elders have lived full lives and know the path to righteousness. Why not end their lives in a sacred way? They could rest in peace, and we'd no longer have to kill the working folk. It's an efficient and humane approach." [[color=blue]No Geronticide[/color]]

*2. "Only the elderly must be sacrificed," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, preparing for @@HIS@@ grandfather's geronticidal death. "Our elders have lived full lives; I mean, we're going to kill them anyway. Why not end their lives in a sacred way? They could rest in peace, and we'd no longer have to kill the working folk. It's an efficient and humane approach." [[color=red]Geronticide[/color]]

**3. "I'm sure the gods wouldn't appreciate withered, elderly sacrifices," argues 55-year-old professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You should instead encourage parents to give their fatally sick or otherwise unwanted children to our cause. You should also let hospitals perform ritual abortions, while you're at it." [[color=red]Abortion is illegal[/color]]

**4. "I'm sure the gods wouldn't appreciate withered, elderly sacrifices," argues 55-year-old professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You should instead encourage parents to give their fatally sick or otherwise unwanted children to our cause. We can even have ritual abortions in hospitals, while we're at it." [[color=blue]Abortion is legal[/color]]

5. "We don't need to sacrifice any @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ when we could, ahem, 'capture' people from our neighboring countries," schemes Dr. Leo Cortisol, your underhanded Minister of Underhanded Solutions, who you don't recall hiring. "No one cares about them anyway. Everyone's gotta go some time!"

6. "It is not our place to say when a person must be killed," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose ancestors hail from the pious nation of Savoiia. "If our children or our elders were truly meant to die for a deity, then let the deity kill them, not us! This inhumane and unholy bloodshed must end, and all ritual sacrifice should be outlawed."

[b][anchor=1181]#1181[/anchor]: Jolly Jousting Japes [Nuremgard; ed: Altmer Dominion][/b]

The Issue
A motley group of sportsmen, equestrians, and medieval reenactment enthusiasts have petitioned the government to bring back the sport of jousting.

The Debate
1. "It'll be awesome!" exclaims medieval scholar @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pointing to a painting depicting the ancient sport. "Bringing back such a revered part of our past would invigorate our cultural life! That said, we'd need to do it the old-fashioned way — meaning a full commitment to lances, armour, and fine horses. What do you say? Let's bring the past to life!"

2. "I think we need to jazz it up a little," suggests popular daredevil @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Knievel. "Instead of jousters using horses and lances, what if they instead play on motorbikes and sports cars? Participants can even use a variety of weapons, such as maces and axes! It'll be bloody, but we'll have so much fun!"

3. "I think we need to jazz it up a little," suggests popular daredevil @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Knievel. "Instead of jousters using horses and lances, what if they instead play on motorbikes and sports cars? Participants can even use a variety of weapons, such as maces and axes!

4. "This proposal gave me an interesting thought," ponders your Treasury Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, admiring @@HIS@@ reflection in a polished shield. "Jousting could very well be a boon for the economy. We could even get the gambling industry in on it: let people place bets on jousting matches while we take a cut of the proceeds. I doubt event coordinators will have any problem filling stadiums with people who'd pay top dollar to experience this real-life, exciting sport!"

[5]. "Why are we only focusing on jousting?" asks posh aristocrat @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ cleans @@HIS@@ glasses. "Don't you think times were simpler and better when everyone knew their place? There were benevolent lords in their manors, peasants merrily tilling the fields, even courtly jousts conducted by illustrious knights. Shouldn't we do our part to make these traditional values a reality again?" [[color=purple]No Feudalism[/color]]

[b][anchor=1182]#1182[/anchor]: Thanks, but No Thanks [Chan Island; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
In a world rife with refugees fleeing natural catastrophes, wars and tyranny, the good people of @@NAME@@ have generously opened their doors to allow asylum-seekers to come live in this fair land. However, in the past year only a single person has taken the nation up on this offer.

The Debate
1. "Well, no kidding," complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the aforementioned sole immigrant, who looks emaciated with malnutrition. "This place is as poor as dirt and I almost feel tempted to brave the bombs again rather than another empty supermarket. You ought to invest a bit, fix the roads, use business subsidies to attract the biggest international industries. In the meantime, can you direct me to the nearest port? I'm going to try my luck in Brancaland."

2. "The real problem isn't our relative poverty," explains your affronted Minister of Immigration. "It's just that people don't get what else we have to offer. You know why we have our borders open to those in need? Because we are a compassionate society — one that struggles to put food on the table, sure, but that's a side effect of our moral priorities. I recommend we offer any refugees a welfare package and charitable aid for the journey. It'll mean digging deeper in our own pockets, but we're happy to go without if it shows the world that we care."

3. "So refugees don't want to come to our country?" asks Social Nationalist campaigner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, grinning broadly. "Fantastic! If the way things are keeps foreigners out, then let's make a point of keeping it that way. Put in measures to keep supermarket shelves understocked, and sabotage economic growth any way you can. We'll stay poor, but at least we'll stay pure."

[b][anchor=1183]#1183[/anchor]: Bloodied but Unbowed [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
You have come to your office this morning to find that your tea hasn't been brewed, your meeting schedule hasn't been laid out, and your plants haven't been watered. There has been a delay in everything as your assistant, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_1@@, has been slacking off work today because it is her 'time of the month.'

The Debate
1. "I can't take it any more @@LEADER@@!" wails @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_1@@, plumping down on your chair in her pajamas — then taking a sip from her chamomile tea and rubbing her belly. "For some women like me, periods are too bloody painful to concentrate on work. All female employees should have a right to paid menstrual leave for up to five days every month. Period. This way, instead of writhing in pain in our workplaces with little to no productivity, we can go shop — err, I mean, take a warm, relaxing shower and rest."

2. "Oh, cry me a river!" exclaims @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your misogynistic Minister of Finance, while rolling his eyes at @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_1@@. "Do you have any idea how much money these 'menstrual vacations' will cost our taxpayers? But no, these snivelling moaners find a new thing to whine about every day: they want breastfeeding breaks, employment quotas, and now this! Hey, my mother was a woman too, but she never complained about anything. When she was pregnant with me, she worked on our cotton field for 12 hours a day, even if it was her time of the month! Do away with this sex-based discrimination and abolish all special concessions to women. And tell this whimperer to take a painkiller — then get back to work!"

3. "How could you even suggest this?" enquires @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your Minister of Chivalry, with a condescending smile on his face. "I think we are looking at the problem in the wrong way. Has it ever occurred to you that doing office drudgery may actually be too harsh and stressful for the frail bodies of the fair sex? I think there would be no need for menstrual leave if women were strongly encouraged to do easy and stress-free menial jobs, like basket-weaving or bead-threading. What do you think?"

[b][anchor=1184]#1184[/anchor]: Wring Out Your Dead [Caracasus; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
A fact finding mission into bollard placement in downtown @@CAPITAL@@ was cut short when your attention was drawn towards a fight between angry, grieving relatives and debt collectors. It appears a debt collection agency picketed a funeral, bellowing out the debts owed by the deceased via megaphone and attempting to collect the money owed from the bereaved relatives.

The Debate
1. "Monsters!" yells out distressed mourner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ tries to squirm free from a debt collector's grip. "These vultures were all over my oldest friend as @@HE_2@@ was dying in a hospital bed! There should be a law against this sort of thing! How can you justify hounding the terminally ill and the dead for money?"

2. "The deceased had debts totaling thirty-eight @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@, before interest and our late payment fees, of course," states debt collector Jessica Quimby representing Hackett, Vulture and Hobbler. "We are within our rights to attempt to collect monies owed. If you were to simplify matters, perhaps by mandating that debts pass to the next of kin upon death, then we would not be forced to take these unusual and distressing measures."

3. "They need their money back, right?" opts your Minister for Bollard Replacement. "It's only, what, thirty @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ plus whatever she said about payment fees. Just let the government pick up the tab whenever someone with minor debt kicks the bucket, and can we please get on our way? These bollards aren't going to inspect themselves!"

[b][anchor=1185]#1185[/anchor]: Should Be Sufficient [Jutsa; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Embracing autarky has reduced access to Merovingian chocolate and Gallopavian flowers, but the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ economy has more or less survived the transition. However, in the distant tiny island nation of Copiluaca, economic activity was formerly almost entirely dependent on selling coffee to @@NAME@@, leaving them with crippling unemployment, tens of thousands in poverty, and an imminent famine.

The Debate
1. "How could we have done this to the poor Copiluacans?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Progress. "Without @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ flowing into their nation, they're falling apart! We need to go all-out and send them as much aid as we can. This is our mess, and our responsibility."

2. "If a nation can't survive on its own, then we're not doing it any favours by giving it charity," says your grumpy Defence Minister, pouring himself a bowl of cereal. "Autarky is a moral choice, borne of opposition to globalism. We should propagate that ideological position with a little tough love. We should blockade their ports and patrol their airspace to stop any remaining international trade getting in or out, and they'll be forced to self-sufficiency. Give a man fish and you feed him for a day. Force him to fish at gunpoint, and he'll fish like his life depends on it. Which it does."

*3. "What about Althaniq, and West Calypso, and Marche Blanche?" inquires novelty latex hat manufacturer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who used to export to all three nations. "That's a lot of nations not getting the benefit of essential, high-quality @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ products. Abandoning the global marketplace was a mistake — let a little free trade back into our lives!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "What about East Lebatuck, and Núi Và Sông, and Haptu?" inquires @@RANDOM_NAME@@, State Director of the Novelty Latex Hat Assembly Factory, who used to export goods to all three nations.

[b][anchor=1186]#1186[/anchor]: The Magic's Gone [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: USS Monitor][/b] 

The Issue
The government's stance endorsing the practice of magic and sorcery has always raised some eyebrows amongst world leaders. Now it seems that spells that ought to work are not giving repeatable results, and sometimes don't seem to do anything at all. A cabal of five magi have come to advise you on the reasons for these sorcerous failings.

The Debate
1. "Magic ebbs and flows like the tide. Today, a spell fails — tomorrow, it succeeds beyond your expectations," explains Magical Headmaster Godric Elminster. "If you encounter setbacks, you keep your chin up and march on. Have a little faith in the High Art, and in the powers of magic that exist invisibly all around us."

2. "Hold on, maybe we need to be more active in looking for an answer," suggests Arcanist Rowena Dresden. "If we want to cast spells, we're going to need a source of magical power. I suggest we set up an agency to hunt down legendary artifacts and mythical creatures. If only we knew more about fabulous beasts and where to find them, I'm sure we could get our thaumaturgy flowing."

3. "Look, the important thing here is not how much power you wield, but how much power you appear to wield," suggests Salazar Constantine, a street wizard, lighting up a cigarette despite the No Smoking sign in clear view. "You need to make announcements that @@NAME@@'s magical puissance is growing on a daily basis, and arrange for a few large scale stage illusions to back up that lie. This will have practical benefits too: as the scepticism of the masses decreases, magic will flow back into the world, enabling true wizards like me to cast real spells for you. Honest truth, guv, would I lie to you?"

4. "Let's not be afraid to name magic as a failed experiment," offers ever-practical will-worker Helga Ged. "Look, we all wanted magic to be the solution to our problems, but when it comes down to it, hard work and elbow grease are what gets things done. Me, I'm putting down my wizard's staff and taking up a fishing rod. It's time we got back to basics."

5. "Actually, my own spells have been working fine," reports a smug little alchemist, who insists he must not be named. "Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange. Make the necessary sacrifices and you'll find that there's magical power aplenty to be had."

[b][anchor=1187]#1187[/anchor]: Tipping Point [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
While glancing down at your doughnut receipt and trying to calculate percentages in your head, you are reminded that many service-industry employees rely on tips to supplement their income. Recently, analysts have suggested that it is the tips themselves that create the low baseline wages.

The Debate
1. "Look, us restaurateurs don't like gratuity-based economics either," complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, proprietor of trendy inner-city eatery The @@CAPITAL@@ Pyramid. "In fact, we trialed going tip-free and incorporating the costs of a decent salary into the bill. Do you know what happened? We lost customers! A higher visible menu price, and the loss of the diners' feeling of power, meant patrons went elsewhere! The only way to fix this is government legislation, banning tipping and regulating the industry. A national approach will level the playing field, which will be good for workers, and good for our profits."

2. "Hi, my name's @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ and I'm just tickled pink to be your coffee server today!" chirps a frankly stunning barista with a huge smile on @@HIS@@ face as @@HE@@ hands you a perfect cappuccino with a marshmallow on top. "@@LEADER@@, I don't get paid a lot, but I'm more than happy to do what I can to earn your tips! It's a great motivation to keep me working hard to make you, my customer, super-duper happy! And if good-looking ethnic-majority twenty-something tight-trousered folk like me end up earning a bit more than most, well that's the wonderful thing about the free market! @@SLOGAN@@!"

*3. "There's definitely something in what @@HE@@'s saying," suggests your brother, tossing a few small denomination coins onto the counter, to the barista's disappointment. "Maybe we could all learn from that. I reckon it'd be good if politicians had a tiny baseline wage too, but were allowed to earn tips by pleasing the people. Or at least, by pleasing the people that are willing to show their appreciation with cold, hard cash." [[color=purple]Must have physical currency[/color]]

*4. "There's definitely something in what he's saying," suggests your brother, rounding his credit card total up to the nearest @@CURRENCY@@, to the barista's disappointment. "Maybe we could all learn from that. I reckon it'd be good if politicians had a tiny baseline wage too, but were allowed to earn tips by pleasing the people. Or at least, by pleasing the people that are willing to show their appreciation with cold, hard cash." [[color=purple]Must not have physical currency[/color]]

[b][anchor=1188]#1188[/anchor]: The Only Good Criminal [Jutsa; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Following your endorsement of masked vigilante justice, costumed heroes have been waging war on the criminals of @@NAME@@. A few nights ago, the masked vigilante known only as Slasher tracked down the Hungry Hippo Gang, an infamous donut-counterfeiting ring. He delivered justice with extreme prejudice, killing the miscreants with his trademark long razors, and leaving the gang literally in pieces.

The Debate
1. "Now don't get me wrong, I appreciate Slashy-washy was trying to serve the public good, but taking life is a line that a true hero can never cross," explains family-friendly spandex-clad superhero The Rubber Waffle. "There's an unspoken code of honour amongst vigilantes! Maybe though, an unspoken code isn't doing the job, and what we need is a written set of rules governing vigilantes. For great justice!" The do-gooder turns to a nearby camera, and takes a swig from @@HIS@@ carton of Justice Milk™.

2. "I don't see nothin' wrong with what ole Slash is doin'," mutters the claymore-wielding Crime-Cleaver. "Us vigilantes are scarin' criminals senseless, I see no reason to view that as a bad thing. Besides, there's no better way to stop a lifetime of crime than by stopping a scumbag's heart! Heck, why not let vigilantes kill all the criminals? That'll soon bring law and order to these mean streets."

3. "I think the real crime here is those crazy costumes," snickers one of your aides. "Actually, the real problem is the people in the costumes. It's about time we put an end to this vigilantism experiment. Let's have policemen handling crime again, delivering justice with a side order of common sense."

[b][anchor=1189]#1189[/anchor]: Driven to Distraction [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b] 

The Issue
Last Friday, a heavy goods vehicle travelling at high speed ploughed into a stationary traffic queue, crushing a small hatchback and ending the lives of the mother and child within it. The twist in the tale? The driver was using his mobile phone, texting that he was running late. This isn't the first tragedy caused by using a mobile phone while driving, but many are hoping that it can be the last.

The Debate
1. "I am father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife," intones widower @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, his voice equally heavy with grief and rage. "I will have my vengeance. I will have justice. A vehicle is a deadly weapon, and driving it with that level of inattention is no different from shooting a gun into a crowd. This is murder, and should be treated as such."

2. "Look, maybe we all know it's not good to check our phones all the time," suggests @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@, a young government aide, her eyes flicking down to her jacket pocket in response to a message alert tone. "But, sad as these tragedies are, let's not criminalise the population. Instead, launch a national safe driving campaign, and require the auto-industry to have hands-free mobile functionality as standard." Her phone beeps again. "Uh... Do you mind if I check this...?"

[3]. "You don't need the laws to be any stricter than before, you just need to crowd-source your law enforcement," pitches Fones4Me CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We've got plenty of free dashcam apps that people can download for their smartphones — all you need to do is publicly endorse their use, and perhaps offer financial assistance for those struggling to buy the latest mobile devices. Knowing they are being watched will make potential offenders drive more safely." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

4. "Look, using a phone while driving just takes a bit of common sense and restraint," suggests auto mechanic @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It shouldn't be a crime in itself. Way I see it, texting and driving is a bit like leaving off your seatbelt, or eating a burger on the move, or resting one eye at a time for a semi-nap on the motorway: you should be allowed to use your own judgement as to whether you can handle it or not, and face up to the consequences only if it goes wrong."

[b][anchor=1190]#1190[/anchor]: Dirty Laundry [The Sakhalinsk Empire; ed: Zwangzug][/b] 

The Issue
Notorious gangster Sal Hattone has finally been arrested for robbery and extortion. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, no traces of @@HIS@@ supposed profits have been found. The only assets in Hattone's possession were a few laundromat stores @@HE@@ invested in, which appear to have no connection to the stolen cash. The nation's top legal experts and investigators have come to you with suggestions.

The Debate
1. "As you can clearly see, @@LEADER@@, my client has no connection to any of the alleged crimes @@HE@@ has been charged with," says Hattone's lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing suspiciously clean clothes. "Obviously you cannot rob or extort someone without taking their money, and with no money to prove my client's guilt, there cannot be any case of robbery or extortion, thus @@HE@@ is innocent. Please have these lawyers get out of my client's hair, and @@HIS@@ haberdashery collection."

2. Public defender @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clad in dirty garments, vociferously protests. "You can't overlook Hattone's investments! Surely @@HE@@ wasn't rich, because if @@HE@@ was, @@HE@@ wouldn't need to commit those crimes @@HE@@ absolutely committed. So where did the money for the investments come from? We need more authority to investigate these so-called laundromats, and every @@CURRENCY@@ that's passed through their doors."

[3]. "Both of those solutions are for the previous generation," notes Microcosm CEO @@RANDOMAME@@, wearing a lightly-stained suit. "What we need is a digital currency, where you can track all payments. That way all this legal nonsense won't happen, since you can't really rob someone, and investments are visible for all to see." [[color=purple]Must not have digital-only currency[/color]]

4. "You businesspeople can't perceive the best solution," says your aide @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who'd rather wear nothing at all. "Just make the government own all of the laundromats and strictly regulate washing machines. That way, no criminals will dream of hiding their money there, and I can become the Minister of Lint like I always dreamed of."

The Issue
Animal rights activists have petitioned the government to ban the selective breeding of pets to enhance certain characteristics, due to the genetic defects that this causes. After your office was inundated with letters filled with disturbing, yet adorable pet pictures, a meeting has been arranged to hopefully put the issue to sleep.

The Debate
1. A lone activist on all fours lets out a howl of despair in solidarity with her animal brethren before speaking. "Arthritis, skeletal deformation, and brain compression: these are just some of the terrible medical conditions caused by the public's desire for 'cute' pets. Features in breeds like the Maxtopian fold cat and the Lilliputian munchkin rabbit are getting more exaggerated, putting the animals' health in greater danger. The government should ban the continued breeding and sale of pets that have severe health conditions due to selective breeding."

2. "Rrrrgraf!" barks Mr. Fuzzykins, the darling Smalltopian hound of Z-list celebrity Berlin Chilton, who translates for her pooch. "Mr. Fuzzykins says that you shouldn't listen to this drama queen, and he wants everyone to know that it isn't at all a burden to him that he's always short of breath and small enough to live in a mini purse. It just makes him more adorable! Isn't that right, baby? Designer pets represent a person's right to choose, and these activists want to take that away. We should be encouraging and funding selective breeding so that we can create even much more cuter pets!"

3. "I agree with Ms. Chilton, but it's not just about choice — this is my livelihood!" whimpers the owner of a local pet shop. "I'm already tied up in knots by bureaucratic diktats that force me to spend my hard-earned @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ just to be issued licenses telling me what I can and can't sell and how many bodies I need to run the shop. The government needs to stop pandering to the feelings of those who want to ruin my business and relax the rules on poor pet shop owners like me. Oh, and can I get a genetic sample from that excellent dog?"

4. "@@LEADER@@, such animals present us with an interesting opportunity," proclaims your Junior Minister of War, snatching Mr. Fuzzykins from his irate owner. "This dog may not look like an awesome weapon of destruction now, but with some selective breeding and a lot of gene editing, we could have a whole battalion of elite canine warriors! We need to get ahead of countries like Dàguó — they've already created super muscular beagles with the help of genome engineering. With your approval, Mr. Fuzzykins here can become Death, the destroyer of worlds."

When bored Brancalandian schoolchild @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_1@@ was playing on her computer, she accidentally found her way into the @@NAME@@ Armed Forces Internal Database. While playing, she promoted a janitor to Admiral of the Fleet, sent the warmongering General @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@ to bombard the Skandilundian border with two dozen tanks and changed the military's motto to '@@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ Rulez 4eva'.

The Debate
1. "This little brat has cost us hundreds of manhours of work fixing all her mischief," roars the hastily recalled General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_2@@ as the Navy's newest Admiral quietly mops the floor beside him. "We need to demand that wretched little monster be extradited here — to the country harmed by her shenanigans — to face punishment. A suitably punitive sentence should set the little villain straight!"

2. "We are heartily sorry that one of our citizens changed the Army's uniform to tutus, wellington boots and visibility jackets," says Brancalandian Home Secretary @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We understand the girl committed a crime and we're willing to see that she gets an appropriate punishment, but extradition isn't needed. Our Brancalandian Young Offenders' Rehabilitative Centres will see to it that she learns the error of her ways. Also she'll be taught the three 'M's: Mindfulness, Meditation, and Maplewood carving."

3. "How can you be so heartless? She's just a little girl!" cries the child's mother Ms. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, over videolink, wringing out a dripping handkerchief. "She thought she was playing a war simulator, and didn't realise that she was actually inside the government mainframe. Leave children to be disciplined by their parents. I'll give her a good talking-to."

4. "Punish her? We should thank her!" declares Captain @@RANDOM_NAME@@, of the Cyber Crimes Division. "She managed to get past an encrypted system without even trying. If she can, Blackacre can. We should pay her to test our systems, and see how many flaws she can uncover."

5. "Maybe we're taking home the wrong lesson here," timorously offers Admiral @@RANDOM_NAME@@, putting@@HIS@@ mop down to address all assembled. "I don't think I'd make a bad admiral, actually. Maybe senior military and government positions ought to be selected randomly as a matter of course.

[b][anchor=1193]#1193[/anchor]: Relocating the Living Room [Baggieland; ed: Baggieland][/b] 

The Issue
As your population has now reached @@POPULATION@@, there has been serious discussion about whether or not the current borders of @@NAME@@ are sufficient. Agricultural and industrial imports have been increasing to unsustainable levels, as former farmland and commercial areas are repurposed for urgent housing needs. Your top advisers have now come to you to address the subject of land appropriation.

The Debate
1. "Our current borders are not sufficient; the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ people need their lebensraum!" fumes General Xiaoping, as @@HE@@ gets right in your face, forcing you to rock back in your chair. "Let's mobilise our armed forces and start claiming new domains. Then, we can repopulate these lands with our own good people. Let's start with Ausonia; their army couldn't outflank a sleeping horse. No doubt, they will thank us for it in the end!"

2. "I think a full-on invasion might turn out costly and embarrassing for us," muses your Trade Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ waves a banana at you menacingly. "The inhabitants of many countries were only armed with sharpened fruit 200 years ago, but now they all have a modern military and equipment to rival our own. Countries can get conquered via diplomacy, you know? Open diplomatic offices and trade branches in some of the 'lesser developed' nations, then create obscurely phrased treaties that gradually wear away their sovereign rights — that way we can still gain control of these places without the violence. But I agree, we should start with Ausonia."

3. "Those ideas will irk the international community," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Finance Minister, who has arrived late for the meeting carrying several hefty shopping bags. "Why not just buy ourselves more land? See what lands smaller and poorer nations are willing to sell to us, then buy them for our colonists. It will cost a bit to begin with, but the outlay involved will probably, I mean, eventually be offset by the productivity of the new lands. I quite fancy this hilly province of Ausonia, I could build my own farm there… let's make them an offer!"

4. "What has Ausonia ever done to us?" enquires @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Interior Minister, as @@HE@@ hangs a 'Home, Sweet Home' banner on your wall. "There are still some places in @@NAME@@ that have a bit of room, you know? We could bore out the mountains, dig under the desert, even drain the swamps. Just give our citizens a financial incentive to move into these uninhabitable… sorry… uninhabited regions, and there's the extra living space we require! I'm not sure exactly what kinds of industry or agriculture could thrive in such conditions, and these people are going to need a decent healthcare plan, but life always finds a way, right?"

A young foreign exchange student was arrested in her language course a couple days ago when she accidentally said, "My friends and I are game for a shooting; we just need to figure out how to signal," instead of, "My friends and I want to make a shooter game; we just need to learn how to code." She was labeled a threat and is now facing deportation.

The Debate
1. "She is already failing my class," says the girl's instructor. "Why should she stay if she can't communicate effectively? We ought to give everyone who enters the country a test that proves they can communicate with us! If they can't get every question correct they should be forced to leave."

2. The girl, now able to explain herself with the help of a police-appointed interpreter, says, "I apologize if I frightened anyone, as that was not my intention. I only wanted to share my interest in video games instead of repeating simple sentences about apples and cats. This never would have happened in the first place if your language wasn't so confusing! Why not simplify it and cut down on the amount of words so that it's easier for everyone to learn?"

3. "The real issue we should be talking about is the ham-fisted way this was handled by law-enforcement," says the officer who was called to apprehend the girl. "I knew she wasn't a threat, but I had orders! Individual police officers should be given more autonomy to decide how we do our jobs."

[b][anchor=1195]#1195[/anchor]: All Hands On Tap [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Hoping to enjoy a quiet afternoon after a busy week full of Cabinet meetings, you are startled as @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, your Minister of Health, rushes into your office without even knocking on the door. She is flushed with indignation, and is obsessively rubbing her hands with an antibacterial wet wipe.

The Debate
1. "Oh, this is a public health disaster, @@LEADER@@!" your Health Minister clamours, slipping on a pair of latex gloves before grasping your hands in supplication. "I was in the restroom just a moment ago, and what should I see there? A vile, vulgar villain who left the stall and strode straight out of the door without washing her hands! This is the third time this week I have seen this disgusting behaviour. We need a public health campaign to remind people to wash their hands properly after using the toilet!"

2. "Excuse me: a villain?" asks Morgan Enuv-Thyme, your secretary, brushing dandruff off your shoulder and blowing a raspberry at your Health Minister. "For your information, I am the villain that she complains about, and I did not wash my hands. So what? Everyone knows that door handles and money have more germs on them than a human bottom, yet nobody washes their hands after touching those. In fact, I think coming into contact with germs probably boosts our immune system, and running taps less is good for the environment. You should be actively promoting water-saving strategies, @@LEADER@@!"

3. "This potty talk is unacceptable!" interjects your aunt, who has come to your office unannounced to bring you brownies for your afternoon tea. "My little darling, we talked about this. Toilet business is private business, and we shouldn't be getting involved. In fact, it's just poor taste all around for public officials to talk about private functions. Let's have some decorum in politics, please!"

[b][anchor=1196]#1196[/anchor]: The Properties of Property [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
A city patrician walking down a narrow street found his path blocked by a slave, who was carrying a large antique vase for @@HIS@@ master and refused to give way. The patrician struck the slave with his cane, which, thanks to the silver @@ANIMAL@@ head adorning its tip, killed the slave and caused the vase to smash on the ground. While the patrician has offered to pay for both destroyed properties, there are questions being raised over what constitutes proper behaviour by and towards slaves.

The Debate
1. "That @@BOY/GIRL@@ was precious to me!" rages the slave's master, shaking his soft-skinned fists in anger. "@@HE@@'s been in my family since Daddy got @@HIM@@ in lieu of an old business debt. Why, the idea of some callous son of a gun raising his hand to @@HIM@@ simply makes my blood boil burgundy! Nobody's got the right to beat a @@BOY/GIRL@@ except @@HIS@@ rightful owner! This should be treated as a case of murder, or at the very least, manslaughter."

2. "With respect to my fellow citizen and slave owner, this is ridiculous," complains the rotund patrician, taking a seat on the back of a wincing arthritic slave on all fours. "A slave is not a human. Rather, it is mere property, so what I did can't be murder. To be a slave is to be of a lower order of existence, owned by a master, but also in fetters to the state and to society as a whole. A slave should be compelled to obey and defer to every citizen in addition to its master, who still has ultimate authority over the slave, of course. Have the law codify the lowly status of the helot, and we can all proceed in a more civilised manner." He breaks wind noisily, to the discomfort of his human stool.

3. "I'm not going to suggest we abolish slavery," starts known abolitionist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "but maybe we could put in some sort of bill of rights recognising universal humanity and the protection of the law? Something like making sure that no slave can be forced to work against their will, and that financial compensation should be offered for all work, and that no man or woman may be the property of another. Not abolishing slavery, nothing so radical. Just giving slaves some basic freedoms, like the right to self-determination. That sounds reasonable, right? No-one could call that abolition!"

[b][anchor=1197]#1197[/anchor]: Aflame with Indignity [Pogaria; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
To protest your government's antagonism towards his religious beliefs, High Priest @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ of the Tranquility of Yellow sat down on a busy street corner this morning, doused himself with fuel, and set himself on fire.

The Debate
*1. "We have witnessed a martyrdom — but [i]you[/i] are responsible for his death!" proclaims the jaundiced Brother @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, whose yellow robes give off the stench of sweat and desperation. "Our temples are being shut down. Our monasteries are looted and ransacked, while our people are beaten for speaking out against it. You must end this persecution of minority religions. We only want to practice our beliefs in peace." [[color=red]Enforced @@FAITH@@[/color]]

*2. "We have witnessed a martyrdom — but [i]you[/i] are responsible for his death!" proclaims the jaundiced Brother @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, whose yellow robes give off the stench of sweat and desperation. "Our temples are being shut down. Our monasteries are looted and ransacked, while our people are beaten for speaking out against it. You must end this persecution of our faith, or of any other religions. We only want to practice our beliefs in peace." [[color=red]Atheist[/color]]

**3. "Dude! That dude just burned himself to death! He didn't even move a muscle the whole time!" remarks witness @@RANDOM_NAME@@, mouth still agape in shock. "If that's the sort of thing that adherents of other religions do, maybe the government is right about not supporting their nonsense beliefs. We obviously need way more mental health support and suicide prevention funding to help these people." [[color=red]Enforced @@FAITH@@[/color]]

**4. "Dude! That dude just burned himself to death! He didn't even move a muscle the whole time!" remarks witness @@RANDOM_NAME@@, mouth still agape in shock. "If that's the sort of thing that adherents of religions do, maybe the government is right about discouraging their nonsense beliefs. We obviously need way more mental health support and suicide prevention funding to help these people." [[color=red]Atheist[/color]]

***5. "Let them burn, and we shall clap our hands!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a fervent believer of @@FAITH@@. "If more Yellowists want to burn themselves, I'll provide the matches. But it is clear that they will soon turn their rage outward. Suppressing their 'religion' was not enough; it has just incensed them! We must get the heathens before they get us. Now is the time to finally round up all of those who don't believe the true faith and expel them from our great nation. It will be a new golden age for my... I mean, our religion!" [[color=red]Enforced @@FAITH@@[/color]]

***6. "The religious nutters are barbecuing themselves now? Let them burn, and we shall clap our hands!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a zealous atheist. "If more Yellowists want to burn themselves, I'll provide the matches. But it is clear that they will soon turn their rage outward. Suppressing their religion was not enough; it has just incensed them! We must get the zealots before they get us. Now is the time to finally round up all of these lunatics and expel them from our great nation. It will be a new golden age for rational thought!" [[color=red]Atheist[/color]]

[b][anchor=1198]#1198[/anchor]: The Death Debate Isn't Dead Yet [Zyris; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
After an investigative journalist broke a story about a widow who had kept her deceased husband's body in her house for over a year, a debate has arisen on how soon a body should be buried after death.

The Debate
1. "This is a public health nightmare," exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Health Minister, while covering @@HIS@@ face with a perfumed handkerchief. "A body that isn't cremated or buried poses serious health risks for the entire neighbourhood. We must require all bodies to be disposed of within a week. We can't just keep grandpa in his favorite chair forever, can we?"

2. "Not so fast!" shouts rights advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "People have a right to mourn the loss of a loved one however they like, and it is none of the government's business to regulate the grieving process. That lady was only keeping her beloved husband's body in her living room while friends and family paid their respects — hey, he was a popular guy! The right to send off a loved one as per your beliefs should be held sacrosanct."

3. "There has to be a solution here and I'm sure we can work it out," declares George Starr, the owner of the largest beetle farm in @@NAME@@, as he places a beetlearium on your desk. "If the government could subsidize my enterprise, then the bereaved can have my beetles strip the flesh off of their loved ones, allowing them to keep the bones for as long as they like. No more health risks, no more nasty smells, no more government interference during this most personal of times."

[b][anchor=1199]#1199[/anchor]: Locked Down [Queen Yuno; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Following the capture of suspected terrorist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_1@@, the @@NAME@@ Bureau of Investigation was stymied in its investigations by being unable to gain access to the suspect's smartphone.

The Debate
1. "The data on this phone could be critical to saving lives from future terrorist attacks," growls Bureau Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, staring at the locked-screen wallpaper on the phone, which shows the suspect raising his middle finger. "There may be contacts of other terrorists, bomb locations, secret plots, the works! The only thing standing in our way of beating those terrorist scum is that pesky passcode that Pear Inc. puts on their phones. Oh, and the retinal scan lock. And the fingerprint scan. The law should oblige people to unlock their phones when the police order them to, and smartphone manufacturers should be forced to put a government backdoor into their devices. National security is at risk!"

2. "We've spent decades protecting the privacy of our users by encrypting their data, and breaking that would be a massive breach of people's right to privacy," objects the CEO of Pear Inc. Steve Task, putting the finishing touches on a data-collection algorithm for targeted advertising. "The government can't be trusted — you'll be spying on whoever you want, even law-abiding citizens. In fact, a back door would make our devices more vulnerable to terrorists and hackers. Besides it's a basic civil right for crime suspects to not be forced into self-incrimination by the state: you and the police should not be allowed to force Mr. @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_1@@ to unlock his phone."

3. "The rights of terrorists are over-valued," mutters Counter Terrorism Officer Jacqueline Bower, picking up a pair of pliers and a vial of acid. "Give me 24 hours with this creep, and I'll not only have his phone unlocked, I'll also make sure he's told us everything he knows."
