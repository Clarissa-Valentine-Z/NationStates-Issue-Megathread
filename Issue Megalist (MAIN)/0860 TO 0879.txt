[b][anchor=860]#860[/anchor]: A Blast From the Past [Singapore no2; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
A teacher and four schoolchildren were killed on a field trip in a remote region of @@NAME@@ after an old anti-personnel mine was accidentally detonated. The landmines - relics of the nation’s previous wars - have taken the lives of many over the years.

The Debate
1. “You can see how important demining is, no?” asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, the CEO of Remove Landmine, an obscure private enterprise based in Bigtopia. “We clear @@NAME@@ of landmines for small price. No need to worry that forests obstruct progress; we remove them too, in big proud explosions. Bigtopian strength!”

2. “Not the Bigtopians!” screeches @@RANDOMNAME@@, fierce patriot and even fiercer guerilla fighter, jumping out of a filing cabinet and tackling the Bigtopian businessperson to the ground. “When the Bigtopian warmongers attacked, we were forced to deploy landmines. Now they have the cheek to try and profiteer from our misery! We should seize all Bigtopian assets and use them to set up a demining fund instead!”

3. “I’ve got an idea!” suggests @@RANDOMNAME@@, Minister of Education and part-time comedian, trying to stifle @@HIS@@ laughter. “Why don’t we teach students proper demining techniques? I’m sure that it’s going to be useful in their everyday lives... somehow. Anyway, it should prevent such an incident from ever occurring again.”

4. “Actually, we don’t need any of that,” explains @@RANDOMNAME@@, an Army Logistics Supervisor, examining a map of @@NAME@@. “Since we were the ones who planted the mines, we could dig up some old documents on how to retrieve them. While it may be more costly than just purposefully detonating all of them, we should be able to reuse any functional ones that we come across. Although some of them might not work as well as newly-made weapons, this would provide a well-needed boost to our military stockpile.”

The Issue
Since you introduced a mandated age of death for your populace, argument has raged about the most seemly way for the elderly to be dispatched.

The Debate
1. “Let’s just do it simply,” states Logan Nolan, who celebrates his twenty-first birthday today. “Upon their last day, the dawn of their sixty-fifth birthday, everyone will walk into a House of Eternal Sleep, take leave of their loved ones and be euthanised with pleasure-inducing chemicals, to the soundtrack of their choice. And seeing as you’ll have the facility built, you should also offer euthanasia to anyone else who wants or needs it.”

2. “And suppose some selfish individualists don’t turn up?” questions Ida-@@RANDOMFIRSTNAMEFEMALE@@ Levine, toying with a metallic bracelet on her wrist. “Society must force people to make the right choice. Dose the nation’s drinking water with a toxin, but give all citizens a daily ‘vitamin’ dose that contains a 24-hour antidote. When it’s their ‘perfect day’, you simply cut off their antidote supply.”

3. “Force is entirely unnecessary,” soothes Alda Huxtable, showing off her tanned legs in a pair of white shorts. “People just need a little death-conditioning. If we teach young children that death is to be embraced, like any other natural process, we truly shall see the dawn of a brave new world. And then no-one shall fear their appointed day: slipping away in a quiet room, with drugs pumping through their veins and the TV blaring as they sip their final drinkie-poos. What spiffing fun!”

4. “No, you can’t have...” gasps @@RANDOMNAME@@, your private secretary who turns sixty-five next month. “I thought that was some kind of misprint. Don’t you realise the kind of experience you’re losing when you kill the old people? Not just someone who’s been there and done it, but an ear to listen no matter what mistake you’ve made or which country you’ve invaded. Besides, if you kill me, who’ll care for my grandkid in the evenings? Well, I just wouldn’t like to be there if you have to tell that little boy you’ve killed his grandparent.”

[b][anchor=862]#862[/anchor]: Friends Close, Enemies Closer [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Proportional representation was instituted in the name of electoral fairness, but within that system it is far harder for any single party to establish an absolute majority of seats. Now, the General Election result is in, and your party has outperformed all others, but with less than 50% of the total popular vote. However, a coalition with one of the smaller and less popular parties would let you form a majority government, but only if you can agree to a deal.

The Debate
*1. “Give us a slice of the action,” smiles Communist Party Chair @@RANDOMNAME@@, placing a small iced sponge cake in front of you, and cutting @@HIM@@self the merest sliver. “We’re not expecting you to end capitalism. We just want a little bit more wage equality and free market regulation.” [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. "Give us a slice of the action," smiles Capitalism Party President @@RANDOMNAME@@, placing an enormous iced sponge cake in front of you, and cutting @@HIM@@self a decent wedge of it. "Look, we're not expecting you to end communism. We just want a little bit of opportunity for private wealth." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

[3]. “All we ask is that you close the doors to those filthy immigrants!” spits @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Nationalist @@RANDOMNAME@@, seemingly disgusted by the colour of the dessert in front of @@HIM@@. “They’re stealing our jobs and using up our resources! Put @@NAME@@ first! Then, we’ll promise to support you on every other thing.” [[color=blue]Immigration is legal[/color]]

[4]. “Why not ally with a party that has no interest in ruling?” asks Libertarian @@RANDOMNAME@@, who has brought @@HIS@@ own strawberry cupcake, and doesn’t look keen to share. “All we want is for you to shrink government a little bit, with the exception of police and military budgets. Then, we can support your new, leaner administration.” [[color=purple]Must have a very large government[/color]]

[5]. “Heaven knows who is your best ally,” comments @@FAITH@@ First party leader @@RANDOMNAME@@, drawing a holy symbol on the cake’s icing with @@HIS@@ finger, “and as it turns out, I’ve got heaven on speed-dial. Increase spending on promoting @@FAITH@@ and recognising our state religion, and you’ll have our support.” [[color=purple]Must have a national religion[/color] AND [color=purple]must have low religiousness[/color]]

[6]. “Don’t deal with all these extremists!” scolds Green Party representative Hermes Deming, calculating the carbon footprint of the proffered pudding. “All we Greens want is a little more green thinking and regulation. Unlike those other lunatics, our approach will actually make you MORE popular with the mainstream.”
 [[color=purple]Must have a very poor environment[/color]]

[7]. “If you’re looking for people that play well with others, then look no further,” suggests Pacifist Party member @@RANDOMNAME@@, taking the moral high ground by declining cake despite @@HIS@@ audible hunger-induced tummy rumbles. “Give peace a chance. Cut back military spending a little, disarm your WMDs and become a better person. Like me.” @@HE@@ smiles at you smugly. [[color=purple]Must have WMDs and high military spending[/color]]

8. "Just an observation, but if we had a more traditional first-past-the-post system then you'd have a majority government with no coalition needed," comments Party Whip @@RANDOMNAME@@, smooshing together the remaining slices into one big slice and shoving it in @@HIS@@ mouth. "Letsh go back to that shysh-tem, and shend theshe ex-shtremists to the fringesh."

9. "Oh... no cake left," says one of your glummest but most loyal MPs, trying to gather up some of the crumbs. "Well, I know it's a bit of a downer, but why don't we just form a minority government? We can seek support on individual bills and votes as we go. I mean, there's always someone who wants something, and if you're careful you can always cut a deal somewhere."

[b][anchor=863]#863[/anchor]: Oiling the Wheels of Diplomacy [Argentinstan; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The nation of Althaniq is a small autocratic desert monarchy that trades oil to @@NAME@@ and in turn is almost wholly dependent on @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ exports. Recently, several nations larger and more powerful than Althaniq have denounced it and introduced punitive trade sanctions and embargoes against them, citing their belief that Althaniq is sheltering and funding terrorist organizations.

The Debate
1. “We, your strategic allies and fellow democratic nations, are voicing our disapproval of totalitarian Althaniq,” explains @@RANDOMNAME@@, an ambassador from Brancaland. “You should join us in condemning their pro-terrorist inclinations and imposing a total trade embargo to force them to change their ways. We have considerable evidence showing that they are funding terrorist cells in Brancaland and many other nations, and they’ve probably been secretly undermining your nation too! They must not be trusted!”

2. “We can’t afford to listen to that old hag,” scoffs your Finance Minister. “Althaniq trade brings considerable prosperity to our economy. I personally... uh, I mean to say [i]we as a nation[/i], make oodles of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ from our exports to them, and our petrochemical-reliant industries benefit massively from their low per-barrel prices. This so-called evidence isn’t proof of guilt, and why is it even our business what our trading partners get up to in their dealings with other nations? In fact, with so many nations embargoing them, we’ll be able to exploit their desperation to demand even lower oil prices. Let’s strengthen trade instead, then sit back and profit.”

3. “Ignore those weaklings!” yells your Minister of Defense, slamming a knife point-first into the table, and knocking over your coffee pot. “This is a perfect time to invade Althaniq! They’re without friends in the world, and they have all those oil wells that would be so much better in @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ hands. Hell, we’ve even got military bases inside their national borders already, to use as staging camps. Let’s strike now, before they suspect anything!”

4. “Has everyone gone out of their minds?” cries your Minister of Underdogs, helping your elderly cleaning lady mop up the spilled coffee. “We should be assisting Althaniq in their time of need, to show that @@NAME@@ looks after its friends rather than judges them. @@LEADER@@, you’re a fair person, right? I humbly suggest that you pick up half the tab for any trade goods our exporters sell to Althaniq, and maybe also offer to increase the price we pay for Althaniq oil. That should see them through these troubling times!”

[b][anchor=864]#864[/anchor]: The Missionary Position [Caracasus; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Sixty-nine @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ missionaries representing @@FAITH@@ were kidnapped and burned at the stake in a small nation bordering Lilliputia. The infamous radical Violetist sect [i]Ultra-Violet[/i] has claimed responsibility for this heinous act. Concerned religious leaders and diplomats have contacted your office to clarify the nation's stance on overseas proselytism.

The Debate
1. "I do not blame these misguided heathens, @@LEADER@@. I blame you!" bellows @@FAITH@@'s outraged leader @@RANDOMNAME@@, shouting down the phone until your ear hurts. "Our brave missionaries travel to the darkest, most dangerous areas of the globe to bring the loving light of @@FAITH@@ to the unbelievers. We cannot expect these poor souls to share our traditional values, but we should be able to rely on a little protection from our armed forces, no? Perhaps a helicopter gunship or two could have averted this tragedy."

2. "Perhaps we should tend to our own flock first?" questions rural lay-preacher @@RANDOMNAME@@, who is clad in sackcloth and an aura of self-loathing. "We should lead not by proselytising our faith abroad but by nurturing @@FAITH@@ within our own borders. Some of the villages I visit barely have a prayer book between them! Just think, for every missionary we pay to send overseas we could instead repair our dilapidated places of worship. Perhaps we might even buy the occasional new pair of shoes for humble preachers like myself?"

3. "A tragedy, @@LEADER@@," coos Lilliputian ambassador @@RANDOMNAME@@, clucking @@HIS/HER@@ tongue. "Rest assured, Lilliputia is shocked and angered by this violent assault on your dear people. Our nation has been plagued by Ultra-Violetists for decades now, though we've lacked the international support to do anything about it! However, our shared history makes us natural allies... even if your people are a bunch of land-swindling children of rabbit droppings. But with your valued diplomatic support - say, selling us arms for generous compensation - we could end this and all menaces at our borders. Oh, and if you happened to send some missionaries here..." @@HE/SHE@@ nonchalantly gestures towards another small nation on Lilliputia's border.

[b][anchor=865]#865[/anchor]: A Funeral for a Fiend? [Nation of Quebec: ed; Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
@@RANDOMNAME_1@@, the controversial former head of the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ military, suddenly died in @@HIS@@ home last night. While @@HE@@ was beloved by many for @@HIS@@ unapologetic patriotism and military service, @@HE@@ was loathed by others for @@HIS@@ xenophobia and alleged war crimes. @@HE@@ is proving to be just as controversial in death as @@HE@@ was in life as you have been asked to honor @@HIM@@ with a state funeral.

The Debate
1. “@@HE@@ was a hero and a true patriot!” exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, the current head of @@NAME@@'s military. “Of course @@HE_1@@ should be presented with a state funeral and full honors! In fact, we should declare a week of mourning and erect a statue of @@HIM_1@@ in @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Square. Damn the expense! Anyone who disagrees is a terrorist-sympathizing, @@NAME@@-hating traitor!”

2. “A funeral for a fascist and a fiend like @@RANDOMNAME_1@@? No way!” rebuffs civil rights activist @@RANDOMNAME@@ while spraying graffiti over an official bust of the deceased. “Is that the message we want to send to the rest of @@REGION@@? That we honor mass murderers and bigots? How about honoring the true heroes of @@NAME@@, like those doctors who worked in cancer research, or scientists who discovered new elementary particles?”

[3]. "This is a classic no-win scenario," notes your personal assistant as @@HE_2@@ begins to clean the defaced sculpture. "The best thing you can do is put the matter to a vote in Parliament, and let our elected representatives decide. At least this way you can deflect the blame if someone yells at you for whatever Parliament decides." [[color=blue]Must be democratic[/color]]

4. “Why bother with state funerals at all?” queries @@RANDOMNAME@@, chairperson of the [i]Angry Taxpayers Federation[/i]. “Talk about a perfectly good waste of our hard-earned money! Let the family of the deceased cover the cost of the funeral so the government can get back to more important things like lowering taxes and cutting government spending.”

[b][anchor=866]#866[/anchor]: O Medication, Where Art Thou? [Palos Heights; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Healthcare professionals around the country are in an uproar due to a five-month shortage of the popular broad-spectrum antibiotic dankomycin, despite claims by the drug manufacturer that production levels are currently adequate for market demand.

The Debate
1. “@@LEADER@@, this is simply unacceptable,” rages @@CAPITAL@@ General Hospital Chief of Staff @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ C. @@RANDOMLASTNAME_1@@, twirling @@HIS@@ stethoscope like a pair of nunchukas. “These companies own the patents for dankomycin and other drugs that are currently facing shortage. This means no other companies can produce these drugs, and our patients continue to suffer. Drug patents should be cancelled when supplies are short so that others can take up the production shortfall, and so we can treat our patients properly.”

2. “Now wait just a minute!” exclaims Mizer CEO @@RANDOMNAME@@ as @@HE@@ struggles against @@LASTNAME_1@@. “By releasing the patent we will never be able to recoup our R&D costs and create new medications! If anything, you need to take a good hard look at retraining those crackpot doctors who keep giving antibiotics to everyone with the sniffles! If they weren’t so liberal with their prescribing then we wouldn’t need so many new antibiotics in the first place!”

3. “You know, all this talk of copyrights and the cost of researching drugs has me thinking about the overall process,” states your Secretary of Health @@RANDOMNAME@@. “What if we just got rid of the regulations that lead to expensive medications? If drug companies aren’t spending so much money on testing and research and development then surely that will decrease the cost of drugs at the consumers’ end!”

4. “Surely you can’t be serious about gutting consumer protections!” exclaims Minister of Regulations @@RANDOMNAME@@. “Those regulations are in place for a purpose: to protect the public! Even so, changing regulations will do nothing to ease the shortage of the vaunted dankomycin anyways. The only option forward is plainly obvious. Force the drug companies who own the patents to manufacture enough medication until this and any future shortages are relieved.”

5. Suddenly, without warning, your least favorite aunt from your mother’s side bursts into your office. “Junior, don’t you know that the drugs our people are taking are filled with dirty chemicals such as magnesium stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate? Instead of drugs, you should provide people with organic herbs such as the ones my health guru sold me!” Before you can reply, she shoves a handful of repulsive ‘herbs’ into your mouth, which you realize are nothing more than common garden flowers.

[b][anchor=867]#867[/anchor]: Museums: Things of the Past? [Het Dietsche Rijk; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
A televised news exposé on the public’s shocking ignorance of national history was almost thwarted when journalist Murray Shafer couldn’t find any visitors to interview at the Museum of @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ History. The report instead aired as a folksy monologue. Within sixty minutes, your office was besieged by all kinds of people who claim to have found the perfect solution.

The Debate
1. "The younger generations are bored with the current offerings," says recently-graduated psychologist @@RANDOMNAME@@, as @@HE/SHE@@ looks up from @@HIS/HER@@ phone for a split second. "When I visit the Museum of @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ History, I don't just want to stare at some ancient objects. What we really need is interaction, and the best way to provide this is through technology. Children are more eager to learn when you use video clips and games to explain history. Imagine being chased by holographic velociraptors at the Museum of Natural History! That would be money well spent, in my opinion."

2. "The real problem is that the average adult appears to have forgotten everything they learned in school," asserts self-proclaimed aristocrat @@RANDOMNAME@@, while swinging around @@HIS/HER@@ wine glass and staining your carpet. "In fact, most people seem completely ignorant of whether @@NAME@@ even existed before you became our leader! How can you expect them to visit museums without an appreciation for history that is repeatedly inculcated throughout their lives? We need to increase government funding for ongoing adult education before expecting the common people to enjoy visiting a museum."

*3.“How can you expect anyone to visit @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ museums?” asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, who entered your office to use the free wi-fi connection. “Face it. An imagination doesn’t have any interesting museums. The Museum of Regional Geography? The Historical House of Hammers? The Gallery of Retail? Come on! The fact of the matter is, the museums are boring. There’s nothing but mundane themes, dull exhibitions, and tiresome pieces. Let’s build some new, up-to-date museums with things we’d all like to see.” [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

*4. "How can you expect anyone to visit @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ museums?" asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, who entered your office in search of the nation's only wi-fi connection. "Face it. @@NAME@@ doesn't have any interesting museums. The Museum of Regional Geography? The Historical House of Hammers? The Gallery of @@MAJORINDUSTRY@@? Come on!

5. "Why bother?" moans known troublemaker and small-government enthusiast @@RANDOMNAME@@, who managed to slip past security. "Museums are a waste of time and a symbol of stolen taxpayer money. Let's just get rid of them all. No one cares about some dusty old things in cabinets. They distract from real matters, like the fight against oppression by the government. WAKE UP PEOPLE! FREE YOURSELVES!" @@HE/SHE@@ continues shouting as security drags @@HIM/HER@@ away.

[b][anchor=868]#868[/anchor]: All In The Family [Drasnia; ed: Nation of Quebec & Wyethalania][/b]

The Issue
An unexpected letter sent by your estranged uncle was found on your desk this morning. In it, he details what he has been up to for the past several years. It abruptly concludes with him being arrested and imprisoned in Brancaland for a slew of criminal charges. These included selling diluted maple syrup, illegally hunting prized Brancalandian Geese for sport, and operating a business without a license.

The Debate
1. “I’m in a sticky situation,” writes your uncle. “I’ve been assigned to share a cell with a moonshiner named Cletus. His buck teeth are not pleasant to look at nor are his armpits pleasant to smell. I would be most obliged if you could use some of your diplomatic wrangling, such as threatening Brancaland with tariffs, to arrange for my release. Perhaps you could wire some money to my account to help me get back on my feet. After all, we’re family, and as the Brancalandian saying goes, ‘blood is thicker than maple syrup’.”

2. The Brancalandian ambassador huffs into your office. “You must understand what a heinous crime your uncle committed. Our maple products are our national heritage and your uncle has completely disrespected that. He may be your family, but you must allow our criminal justice system to punish him as it sees fit. If you’d like, we can even give you a tour of the prison facilities to show that he isn’t being mistreated.”

3. “This kind of sounds like one of those Tasmanian Prince scams to me,” muses your secretary. “Actually, that gives me an idea. Deny that he’s your uncle and write him off as a con artist trying to get out of prison. If we are to believe that ambassador, he won’t be in much actual danger there. Sure, he won’t be happy staying locked up, and neither will other family members now that I think about it. Then again, he broke Brancalandian law and I don’t want to risk losing my supply of Brancalandian goose down coats over this!”

[b][anchor=869]#869[/anchor]: I'll Be in My Bunker [Ilyichicov; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
With rising world tensions, many people are clamoring for nuclear bunkers.

The Debate
1. "We need a communal shelter in each major city for when the inevitable global nuclear war arrives," declares Ivana Locke, self-proclaimed concrete pouring expert, who is phoning in on her two-hour drive from @@ANIMAL@@ City to @@CAPITAL@@. "You spend the money, and you do it right. You make one mistake, @@NAME@@, one tiny little mistake, and the whole world comes crashing down around you. It'd also be a worthy public works project, helping the unemployed now and for the foreseeable future."

*2. "I agree we do need bunkers, but Ms. Locke has not gone far enough," worries paranoid local @@RANDOMNAME@@. "You hear about the four-minute warning? That's how much time we have to get to shelter. Everybody deserves to survive the nuclear apocalypse, not just those who are lucky enough to be close to a communal vault. You should have one shelter for every @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ home. I know, I know, too expensive - that's why you make it a building regulation, and force home builders to meet that standard." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. “I agree we do need bunkers, but Ms. Locke has not gone far enough,” mutters agoraphobe Enver Gjirokastër, building a fort under your desk with stacks of manila folders. “The protection of the nation requires bunkers not just as fallout shelters, but also to employ defence-in-depth against an infantry attack. Every worker must be able to contribute as an impromptu militiaman to the noble endeavour of safeguarding our nation! You should have a series of one-man shelters, perhaps one for every @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ home. As an added benefit, that means those of us who live alone can stay that way, when the apocalypse comes.” [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "Why bother with coward-houses when our enemy could be eradicated before they could consider striking us?" asks political hawk @@RANDOMNAME@@, swatting a fly on the wall with a double-handed axe. "No complicated shenanigans either, just a small increase to our nuclear arsenal to make us capable of destroying the very planet we stand upon. Nobody would be that crazy to attack us if we had that!"

5. "I think I speak for all sane folk when I say we don't need this rubbish," offers a passer-by from outside your window. "Nukes are just for posturing - nobody ever uses them! I read that in Brasilistan they got rid of their nuclear deterrents altogether, and I don't think it ever hurt them. We should give the taxpayer a break by paring back our military, committing to no nukes, and living our lives in pleasure. I'm not paying for an event that may or may not even happen! And if I'm wrong, we'll all be dead anyway."

6. "You know, we could save money by investing in just one super-luxurious fallout shelter," observes trans-humanist visionary Roberta House, via a video call. "Build one just for the ten thousand or so people that really matter - the politicians and leaders of industry. You can keep a freezer full of sperm and eggs from carefully-picked beautiful and brilliant individuals, to help maintain future genetic diversity. Let the common folk worry about the ramifications of the nuclear winter for themselves. A hundred or so years later, our descendants will emerge. Humanity will be reborn from the brightest, the best, and the wealthiest!"

[b][anchor=870]#870[/anchor]: @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ Literally Exploding With Excitement [Singapore no2; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
For a time now, there have been rumours of citizens spontaneously exploding during moments of extreme happiness. You originally believed it to be either an urban myth or a metaphor, but you soon realised that it was no hoax after an ebullient health official combusted in front of you after a long-due promotion. As your security staff were about to hustle you away, your Minister of Information revealed the truth to you. It turns out that the subcutaneous identification chips implanted in @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ have a few technical glitches, and occasionally explode.

The Debate
1. “It seems that I failed to disclose the risks inherent in these chips,” admits @@RANDOMNAME@@, the Minister of Information, who is examining a blueprint for the device. “While it may be tempting to do away with them, you must remember the purposes that they serve. These chips help to monitor our citizens, store health metadata and simplify bureaucratic processes, saving time and resources. We’ll just have to try to find a solution for the problem and hope that no more incidents happen in the meantime.”

2. “This cannot continue!” exclaims Minister for Health @@RANDOMNAME@@, still shell-shocked and viscera-splattered by the horrifying death of one of @@HIS@@ best employees. “I was already against implanting electronic parts into our citizens for no good reason, but putting their lives on the line is going too far. We must remove all of these hazardous chips before any more lives are needlessly lost!”

3. “So you’re telling me that these chips explode when emotions flare?” inquires @@RANDOMNAME@@, the Chief of Police. “There are many criminals still at large in our country, and they’re always one step ahead of us. If we were to damage their chips - perhaps by flooding the media with concepts that would shock normal folk but make criminals happy - we would be able to execute the criminals remotely and at no cost to the police. If there’s nothing left to arrest... then justice has been served, am I right?”

[b][anchor=871]#871[/anchor]: It's Not Easy Being Red [The Grene Knyght; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The National Collective of @@MAJORINDUSTRY@@ Workers released a manifesto today demanding immediate economic reform - citing recent food and medicine shortages - and threatened to revolt if their demands were not met. As an emergency congress assembles, members of the party are taking to the floor to suggest what is to be done.

The Debate
1. “Power to the people!” shouts manifesto co-author @@RANDOMNAME@@ while starting up the building’s backup generator as the electricity cuts off. “We need to form peaceful, voluntary workers’ co-operatives across @@NAME@@. Now more than ever we need true socialism, not another oppressive, bureaucratic hierarchy. Picture it: as the means of production are placed into the workers’ hands, they’ll be able to decide for themselves what to produce, how what they produce is used, and when to show up for work. It’ll be wonderful!”

2. “Spies, saboteurs, and traitors are at the center of our economic woes,” declares @@RANDOMNAME@@, your mustachioed Minister of Anti-Revisionism, while attempting to drive a T-34 tank into the building. “Only a strong, centralized state can protect the revolution. We need more party control over factories, we need to forcibly collectivize all farmland, and we need to increase police funding to make sure it all gets done.”

3. “Full automation, @@LEADER@@!” cackles your worryingly eccentric science advisor while working on plans for the latest spy satellite. “The people aren’t receiving enough food and medicine and whatnot due to our antiquated systems of distribution. If we automated these systems using my latest resource planning software, we could one-up those inefficient bureaucrats in Central Planning! Some of the robotic delivery technology that the simulation relies upon hasn’t been developed yet, but I’m sure with enough funding we can work through it within the next few weeks. Or months. Maybe a decade or two, actually.”

4. “Socialism in only one country is a failure!” proclaims bespectacled minister Leon Bone, stroking his goatee. “Only a global revolution can be truly successful. We must strengthen ties and form economic unions with other revolutionary nations, like East Lebatuck, to ensure that we can meet the basic needs of our people. We must also fund left-wing rebels abroad, and if it comes to it, we need to commit to war in order to propel the world into a new era of communism. We may become an international pariah, but what do we care of the opinions of capitalist pigs?”

5. “Maybe we’ve been heading in the wrong direction,” suggests Minister of Resource Allocation @@RANDOMNAME@@, nervously speaking at a low volume so that only you can hear @@HIM@@. “Our current system just can’t keep up with all of the @@POPULATION@@ people in the nation. A little bit of capitalism on the individual level wouldn’t be all that bad, as many of our allies could tell you. The Socialist Republic of Núi Và Sông even has a stock exchange!

If the government and mainstream parties were to pay attention to voters for once, then maybe we wouldn’t need to exist! You must give us more direct democracy - referenda, public consultations and the right to have petitions discussed by parliament. Until then, we will defend our right to protest!”

3. “You could learn a thing or two here!” exclaims comedian Jon Warden, handing you an aboriginal talking stick with ‘property of Lord Kettlenoggin’ written on it. “Spice up parliament by cracking a few jokes, dressing up in wacky ways, and capering a little. Don’t take politics or life so seriously - nothing is permanent.”

[b][anchor=873]#873[/anchor]: Terrified Testimony! [Euro-Asiata; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
A hung jury and subsequent mistrial was declared yesterday in the case of the murder of Rachel Swanson, the wife of writer and actor Dave Swanson. While the evidence seemed to clearly point to Swanson, the matter was muddled by the fact that he had been writing an exposé of Mendesmetetics, a dubious religious organization that he and his wife had recently left. Now prosecution, defense, and special interests have gathered in your office to loudly debate the ground rules for the retrial.

The Debate
1. “The behaviour the defense exhibited in the courtroom was obscene!” harrumphs prosecutor Mack McJoy, pounding his fist on your desk and sending stationary flying. “Instead of presenting a case, this hack of a lawyer simply resorted to fear-mongering about the horrors of Mendesmetetics. Three jurors apparently feigned illness for fear of reprisals from this wackadoo cult and my star witness refused to testify! If we are to maintain the integrity of the legal system, we must crack down on these dubious practices. Force witnesses to testify, make jury evasion a felony, and tighten the restrictions on what is and isn’t admissible in court!”

2. “You don’t understand,” explains defense attorney Jackie Cochran while stuffing newspaper into a pair of gloves. “Those jurors, along with everyone else in that room, had good reason to be afraid. This sinister cult doesn’t take kindly to those who betray them. I guarantee they have information on everyone who sat in that juror’s box. Representatives of Mendesmetetics were even sitting in the front row of the courtroom, staring down my witnesses! With the kind of resources they have at their disposal, I’m certain that these nutjobs killed Rachel Swanson and framed my client. If you want justice, you have to protect us from the real villains. Give round-the-clock security to witnesses, jurors, and lawyers, or you’ll be responsible for whatever happens!”

3. A dapper gentleman in a suit who you recognize as the head of your crime prevention task force taps you on the shoulder. “I think we can see the real issue here. Terrified juries? Witness intimidation? Fear of reprisal? This is all an impediment to swift and brut- I mean, fair justice. Simply do away with juries and bar the public and press from courtrooms, and we can make all of these problems disappear.”

The Issue
After losing a lengthy legal battle with his mother-in-law, @@RANDOMMALENAME_1@@ is making a final petition to you. He is seeking permission to remove life support from his wife, @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME_2@@, who has been in a persistent vegetative state since a road accident seven years ago.

The Debate
1. "My mother-in-law clings to the foolish belief that her daughter will spring back to life," cries Mr. @@RANDOMLASTNAME_1@@, pounding his fists on his chest. "But I know the @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME_2@@ I loved - the sweet woman who teased me about my unruly cowlick - is no longer in there. The body in the hospital is just a shell, kept alive by tubes and machines. My @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME_2@@ would never have wanted that. Let me set her free."

2. "That vile excuse for a husband talks about unplugging my baby from life support, as if she were just a television being turned off," weeps @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME_2@@'s mother. "But a mum knows her child! My plucky little girl is a fighter who won triathlons. I read in [i]Peeps Magazine[/i] that people come out of comas all the time. Doctors give up hope, and then they suddenly wake up, demanding fries and Eckie-Ecola. He's given up on my girl - he probably wants to run away with some cake-baking hussy from @@ANIMAL@@ City. But... you must never ask a mother to give up hope." 

*3. "You know, all this was unnecessary," muses @@RANDOMNAME@@, your ever-practical Minister of Solutions. "We should force everyone to decide what they want to happen in case of incapacity, while they're young and [i]compos mentis[/i]. If Mrs. @@RANDOMLASTNAME_1@@ had made a living will, everyone would have known her wishes, and there'd have been no legal battle. Also, had she not wanted to live in this tragic state, it would have avoided a lot of expense for the poor taxpayer. What? I'm just saying!" [[color=red]Must have universal healthcare[/color]]

[b][anchor=875]#875[/anchor]: They See Me Trollin’, They Threatenin’ [Nation of Quebec; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
As more and more citizens connect to each other through social media, there has been a spike in online death threats, particularly ones aimed at government officials.

The Debate
1. “A threat posted on Twitcher or MyFace isn’t any less credible than one made over the phone or in person,” suggests @@RANDOMNAME@@, your personal bodyguard and former police officer, as @@HE@@ adjusts @@HIS@@ sunglasses. “There are many organized groups on there who are dedicated to spreading hate and violence, including some who advocate a violent overthrow of the government! We need to increase surveillance on these sites and arrest anyone who threatens the life of another. Privacy be damned!”

*2. “I agree that these threats should be taken more seriously, but becoming a surveillance state isn’t the way to do it,” replies @@RANDOMNAME@@, acne-prone teenager, and veteran of three internet flame wars. “The problem is the social media companies’ utter lack of effective moderation. You should see some of the comments the trolls get away with! Force the companies to create effective policies to deal with this sort of thing and notify the authorities if anything gets too serious.” [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. “I agree that these threats should be taken more seriously, but becoming a surveillance state isn’t the way to do it,” replies @@RANDOMNAME@@, acne-prone teenager, and veteran of three internet flame wars. “The problem is the government social media division’s utter lack of effective moderation. You should see some of the comments the trolls get away with! Force them to create effective policies to deal with this sort of thing and notify the crime division if anything gets too serious.” [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. “What about my free speech?” demands notorious far-right troll [i]2Many_Big_Nosed_Bigtopians[/i]. “People should be allowed to say whatever they want, especially on the internet! It’s not my fault that these overly-sensitive snowflakes can’t handle some choice criticisms or if some of my followers send death threats. You know what I do when someone threatens me online? I laugh it off and threaten them right back! We don’t need a government nanny state jumping on the political correctness bandwagon.”

[b][anchor=876]#876[/anchor]: Sequels: The Saga Continues [Nation of Quebec; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
After the ban on sequels, the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ film industry has produced films that have been praised by critics and won multiple awards, but which have bombed at the box office. The lack of revenue is worrying studio executives, producers, and moviegoers alike.

The Debate
1. "We need our popcorn flicks back!" complains film director Michel Cove, who holds the 'Most Explosions on a Film Set' record.  "I haven't made a single film since the ban, and the masses are emptying out of movie theaters.  Sure, my [i]TransMorphers[/i] series isn't some pretentious arthouse bull that sweeps the awards, but it does bring the big bucks, and that's exactly what the industry needs right now.  Not to mention this ban tramples on my freedom of expression."

2. "Allowing sequels will only continue the dumbing down of this once-great nation," suggests film critic Gene Ebert, giving his trademark thumbs down to the director.  "There was a reason why we banned them, you know.  Films like [i]To Kill a Laughing Bird[/i] or [i]Citizen Bone[/i] might not make a killing at the box office, but they tell beautiful and important stories that might not otherwise get to touch the world.  The film industry simply needs to do a better job at advertising them.  Perhaps a little government funding could go a long way."

3. "Perhaps there's a compromise," suggests your movie buff niece, who had just come back from her [i]Star Battles[/i] marathon.  "What if we allow some sequels, but only if the original film is a commercial [i]and[/i] a critical success?  This means no more [i]Mildly Spooky Movie[/i] sequels, but it'll allow the excellent [i]Planet of the @@ANIMALPLURAL@@[/i] series to continue.  It may not please everyone, but I think that's a more than fair alternative."

[b][anchor=877]#877[/anchor]: Gunning for Profits [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The diplomatic peace process between historic enemies Maxtopia and North Bigtopia is gaining momentum, to the delight of many who have worked hard to end this decades-long conflict. However, many @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ defence contractors are feeling less than celebratory, as the outbreak of peace has led to both nations cancelling longstanding and lucrative arms deals.

The Debate
1. “We’ve got cancellations on multiple big-ticket items, including a squadron of Blue @@ANIMAL@@ fighter jets,” complains arms manufacturing bigwig @@RANDOMNAME@@. “Jobs and profit margins are at risk! If you want a healthy defence industry in this country, you have to persuade the two nations to renew their contracts. If that means napalming them until they comply, then so be it! Shall I put you down for a dozen long-range bombers?”

2. “Look, we don’t have to be so blatant about things,” whispers your new janitor, who you realize is actually the CEO of Armat Battlefield Systems in an elaborate wig. “All you need is a dozen of your most loyal and discreet black ops soldiers wearing Maxtopian uniforms and carrying M41s, the rifle of choice of the Maxtopian Colonial Marine. Send them into North Bigtopia, have them shoot up a government building, and make sure they’re caught on camera. Next thing you know, we’ll all be back in business.”

[3]. “Sometimes markets change; we just have to adapt,” suggests @@RANDOMNAME@@, the pragmatic director of a start-up company specialising in fragmentary grenades. “Maybe the thing to do is to get rid of any restrictions on civilian ownership of military vehicles and weapons, and let us make more sales to the masses rather than to nation-states. I mean, what red-blooded young man wouldn’t like his own mobile missile launcher?” [[color=blue]Guns are legal[/color]]

4. “Why don’t we go with the flow rather than make war on the peace process?” asks Diplomatic Corps Director @@RANDOMNAME@@, bringing you a nice cup of tea. “Scale down our own military spending, subsidise business interests that can profit from peace in the region, and let our own economy become less dependent on manufacturing the tools of destruction. Oh, that’s weird,” @@HE@@ declares, while brushing at a glowing red dot that has appeared over @@HIS@@ chest.

[b][anchor=878]#878[/anchor]: DoublePlusUnGood [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Horrifyingly, there continues to be whispered dissent against your glorious and righteous rule.

The Debate
1. "War is peace," asserts your Minister of Peace, wiping blood from a stainless steel truncheon with a velvet cloth. "Nothing brings a nation together like an external enemy. Find a strategically inferior nation to declare war on, exaggerate their threat with demonising propaganda, and watch as the proles unite behind you in hatred of your shared foe."

2. "Freedom is slavery," observes your Minister of Plenty, while carrying out his daily physical jerks to keep himself fit. "Grab those who complain, and strip them of their liberty by putting them to forced labour in service of the state. Good citizens will have the incentive to behave better, and our economy will benefit from a costless workforce."

3. "Ignorance is strength," quacks your Minister of Truth, going through the dictionary with a black marker, and striking out words she doesn't like. "We need to reduce the nation's capacity for critical thinking, for unpatriotic doubt and for rebellious intellectualism. Blissful unreason, with a vocabulary that is too limited to express dangerous ideas - that is how we achieve a compliant population."

[b][anchor=879]#879[/anchor]: Power to the (AI) People [Kenmoria; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
After an engineer accidentally deactivated an electrical failsafe, parts of @@NAME@@ were plunged into darkness as a power surge swept through the grid, destroying many pieces of electronic equipment. What should have been a quick routine analysis soon turned into a criminal negligence investigation after it transpired that several AI citizens perished due to the surge. Now, people are unable to decide who - or what - is to blame.

The Debate
1. "This is an outrage!" angrily beeps Sal5000, a well-known AI and prominent activist. "Many of my friends and neighbours were killed by this power surge and legal action needs to be taken immediately. If a human had been deprived of oxygen through gross negligence, wouldn't we press charges? The engineer in question must be held responsible for this... um.... AIslaughter?"

2. "Don't get me wrong, I respect AIs as much as the next man, or machine," interjects @@RANDOMNAME@@, the engineer's manager. "But surely you can see there has to be some sort of moderation here. All the engineer did was cut the wrong wire and the whole grid went down. Have you seen how complex those transformer stations are? My staff need better training, and government bursaries to pay for it."

3. "I do outstanding work, and people are trying to blame me!" protests @@RANDOMNAME@@, architect of the nation's electrical grid. "People are using far more electricity now than when we built the infrastructure. It's hardly my department's fault that we've not got the budget to modernise our network. If the government wants to prevent this from happening in the future, they should invest in upgrading the power grid."

4. "Now all the AI 'lives' being lost are of course tragic, but what about the expense?" questions your infamously greedy Finance Minister, who sits lovingly caressing a pile of coins. "These AIs cost a fortune to upgrade now we can't simply throw out obsolete models so why don't we take a... different approach. Remember the old days, when if a robot broke you bought a new one? Wasn't the world better - and cheaper - then? Go back to treating AIs as the machines they are, and all this fuss can be over."
