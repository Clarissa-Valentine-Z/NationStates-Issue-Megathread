[b][anchor=1040]#1040[/anchor]: A Recipe for Success? [State of Minnmar; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Popular coffee chain Moonbucks recently found itself in hot water after its Moonbucks Magic Mocha Machiatto Mixer was found to include ingredients that might lead to an increased risk in cancer, or at least a really upset stomach. Moonbucks had been using these substances despite knowing about their bad press, but as the ingredients list wasn't visible or published anywhere they had escaped comment until now.

The Debate
1. "I can't believe that these companies aren't forced to disclose everything in their products!" yells frequent coffee-slurper @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a little hyped up from @@HIS@@ fifteenth espresso of the morning. "The government needs to force every company to disclose a full list of ingredients regardless of the product, as well as health warnings! We need to know when our drinks contain harmful chemicals!" @@HE@@ points at you accusingly with a trembling index finger, twitching visibly from caffeine overload.

2. "There's no harm from the additives in our products!" says @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ 'Cappuccino' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, CEO of Moonbucks, sipping from a glass of plain tap water. "No one has come to any harm... yet. People need to quit worrying about what's in the things they eat or drink and just learn to relax. The government should buy everyone a Moonbucks frappucino to help them with that."

3. "Coffeeheads, I ask you..." sighs tea-lover Earl Gray, sipping delicately from a china cup. "Why does anyone drink coffee, anyway? You should tax the foul stuff, and redirect those funds into subsidising more civilised drinks. Then perhaps while we take tea, we can enjoy the more cultured things in life - like a classic book or a proper biscuit."

The Issue
Rather unexpectedly, @@NAME@@ reached the final match of the Calvinball World Cup, but was defeated by heavily-favored Ausblic. Your advisors have started a lively debate on the topic at the next day's budget meeting.

The Debate
1. "I'm as shocked as everyone else!" utters your Minister of Boardgames, Athletics, Leisure, and League Sports, while watching the team's highlights on @@HIS@@ phone. "We had to play defending champions Tasmania, and everyone thought we were going to get killed, but then one of their players stumbled into the Zone of Forfeiture! We might have even had a chance against Ausblic if we hadn't botched the dance-off round. With a little more funding, we could easily build @@NAME@@ into a Calvinball powerhouse. Maybe you could divert a bit from the education budget; after all, if you're making a fortune playing a sport, an education isn't that important!"

[2]. "Funding isn't the problem," claims Interior Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is still wearing a national team scarf. "There are too many foreigners playing for our local teams. The club coaches never give our young players a chance; they just go out and pay big money for the established players from abroad. This denies our young ones the opportunity to gain top-level experience that we could have used to beat Ausblic. If we want to lift the trophy at the next tournament in Althaniq, we need a law that prevents clubs from having more than one overseas player." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]; [color=blue]Must not be an autarky[/color]]

3. "Look, I was cheering for our team as much as everyone else," states your Minister of Cost-Cutting and Harsh Realities, using a red pen to cross out large sections from the latest national budget. "But we only got through to the final because Maxtopia's star player got a violet card in the first quintile and had to wear a blindfold for the rest of the match. Before that, Marche Blanche's team was penalized ten wickets for being unable to sing their national anthem backwards. Let's be realistic: our success was just a fluke. I recommend that we slash funding for all of this sporting nonsense and give our citizens a nice tax cut."

4. "You know, I've heard rumors that host country East Lebatuck only got as far as they did because they slipped hallucinogens into the drinking water of their opponents," suggests Intelligence Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while fiddling with prototypes of the latest spy cameras. "Some of the Bigtopian players even claimed to see a talking tiger on the field! If we offered to host one of these sporting spectacles - and then made a few 'donations' to the International Calvinball Federation to ensure we were selected - we could have a similar advantage. Just say the word, and I'll have our research labs start working on an array of undetectable sedatives."

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Space Agency's newest rocket exploded shortly after takeoff, a tragedy many have attributed to the fact that its trajectory was plotted by slide rules and protractors.

The Debate
1. "Our space agency will fail spectacularly if we don't have advanced computing methods!" prognosticates frizzy-haired head of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Space Agency @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shaking nervously as @@HE@@ tries to perform differential calculus on an abacus. "You can keep distracting gadgets away from the common folk, but if you want us to shoot for the moon, please let us use computers on the job!" A row of beads comes loose from the abacus, spilling everywhere.

2. Former computer manufacturer @@RANDOM_NAME@@@ hastily trips over the strewn beads. "If you just legalise computers for the entire nation, not only can you help our rocket men, you can help the economy get back on track. I'm sure people will be thrilled to download the latest antivirus software!"

[3]. Marche Blancian hacker-turned-entrepreneur Star-Thief peers over your shoulder. "Why compromise your adorable country's laws? I'd be happy to headhunt some of my compatriots to run simulations for you. It's that simple - computers aren't technically allowed here, and the space mission runs smoothly. It's a positive-sum game, if you will." [[color=blue]Must not be an autarky[/color]]

4. "If we want to keep our space program pure and full of national spirit, we need to find a solution other than electronics," complains emeritus professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This is just a tragic symptom of our citizens' innumeracy. Ensure the next generation has strong mathematical aptitude, and we'll be charting fresh courses in no time."

[b][anchor=1043]#1043[/anchor]: Foundering Fashionistas [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
[i]Coddle[/i], your niece Molly's fashion line, is failing rapidly with critics, fashionistas and fellow designers saying the clothing is "ugly", "weird" and "appears to have been designed by and for blind lollipop sticks rather than women".

The Debate
1. "These peasants cannot appreciate the workings of the creative mind," sneers your niece, who appears to be wrapped in cellophane and wearing a dead @@ANIMAL@@ on her head. "My aim as an artisan is to provoke and excite with my glorious creations, not to appease yokels who don't know how to carry off a three-foot crinoline layered with scarlet PVC intercut with cunning rhinestone-studded silver panels. Only my dear relatives, and other such intelligent persons, could hope to understand. You must fund my clothing line - and to show you how grateful I am, I'll design a fabulous bespoke 'look' just for you, with a one-of-a-kind suit and my special hand-crafted make-up range. Let my creativity soar!"

2. "I don't know what's wrong with that girl," sighs her mother, plucking lint from the collar of her sensible navy suit. "Her father has always spoiled her, and now I worry you're going to do the same. He gave her ample @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ to start this venture, and she's lost it all. I always said, Molly should have been left to learn to succeed or fail on her own. If you're going to invest taxpayer money in anything, it should be in subsidising business skills classes at community schools, to help children who haven't already had every advantage."

3. "The problem isn't that your niece has already [i]had[/i] help, nor that no-one appreciates her... ahem... creativity," coughs designer Yvette Saint-Marie, who sports a tasteful monochrome dress, as she sits and crosses her ankles demurely. "It's that those monstrosities are so very frightful that no-one in their right mind would buy them, or accept them as a gift, or even give them to an enemy as a mean-spirited joke. There's no point in throwing good money after bad, but that doesn't mean that other people should not be aided. A governmental hardship fund should subsidise aspirational entrepreneurs with genuine artistic merit."

The Issue
After your Education Minister came in last place at a national spelling bee and your Minister of Defense recently confessed to having never graduated high school, the nation's more learned citizens have questioned whether or not "uneducated" politicians have the right to govern them.

The Debate
1. "Do you honestly want someone who spells violet with an 'f' to be in charge of educational policy for our children?" quips @@RANDOM_NAME@@, often considered to be the smartest @@MAN@@ in @@NAME@@, after painstakingly choosing the best chair to sit in. "It's high time we educated folk are treated with some respect around here. I'm tired of seeing these dumb-dumbs in charge when they barely have the intelligence to run a lemonade stand, let alone a country with @@POPULATION@@ people. Therefore, in the interest of preserving this country's future, we must force all current and future politicians to pass a rigorous intelligence test. Anyone who is not ranked as a genius or higher must be barred from any sort of public office!"

2. "The complication is that @@NAME@@ is a vast cesspool of cultural stupidity, not the electioneering and administration of the government," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of the @@CAPITAL@@ chapter of highbrow society The League of Brainboxes. "Every diurnal course I'm distressed to see simpletons who credit crystals, specters, charlatans, religious superstition, reality television, and other such tomfoolery. If @@NAME@@ is to convalesce its approbation, the citizenry must partake in more intellectual pursuits: televised chess matches, strategy endeavors, and intense philosophical debates. All other activities and pursuits are frivolous and must be verboten."

3. "Me fail grammar? That's unpossible!" chimes in your easily amused Education Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while trying to balance a pen on @@HIS@@ nose. The Education Minister is quickly pushed aside by your always-angry Defense Minister, who looks like @@HE_1@@ is about to have an aneurysm. "Who are these nerds and brainiacs to tell us how to run our country? The people voted us in and we ought to respect that. So what if I don't have some fancy-schmancy diploma? It's just a piece of paper. Any citizen should be free to run for office, regardless of how smart they are."

The Story So Far
The tragedy of the @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange attack is in the past and will forever be in the nation's memory. But memory can be a fickle thing...

The Issue
A small but vocal group of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ activists have formed the organization "Fact Battlers" and are questioning the circumstances surrounding the @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange bombing. Several Fact Battlers have gone so far as to harass and even assault survivors.

The Debate
1. Budding theatre actor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the affected survivors, cries melodramatically into @@HIS@@ neckerchief. "These people bother me every day... and... say horrible things. I've had people shouting at me that I was paid to spread propaganda and that I'm just pretending that my best friend died. You need to stop these people. Arrest them if you need to!"

2. Investigative journalist Terry Mission, founder of Fact Battlers, interrupts while brandishing a thick sheaf of papers. "Don't be deceived by false emotion! This is a false flag operation being perpetuated by the Globalists. Right here in the Commission Report, we read that burning diesel from the truck contributed to the destruction of structural supports in the Exchange. How can that be? Diesel can't burn through brick! You need to take the red pill and reject these supposed 'truths' that you are being force-fed. Then, you can arrest all of your advisors who helped to carry this plan out."

3. "These conspiracy theorists' so-called evidence is based on faulty science and wilful ignorance," counters your Science Adviser. "Every single claim of theirs has been thoroughly refuted and debunked. The only way to combat their horrific beliefs is by winning the battle of ideas. Print pamphlets and scientific papers that demonstrate how wrong they are, and distribute them to every household. This should keep more people from joining Fact Battlers, convince some of the Battlers to change what they believe, and let the survivors get their much-needed peace."

[4]. Walter Lee, your loyal driver, swings a fist at Mr. Mission, knocking him down. "Boss! We were there, you and me! We dug through rubble with our bare hands! People like these don't deserve to be listened to, they deserve a good beating for disrespecting the dead. Come on, give him a nudge or ten with your steel-capped boots. You know he deserves it."

The Issue
While touring a new state-of-the-art hospital in southern @@CAPITAL@@, a mob of concerned healthcare professionals cajoled themselves into a cramped elevator with you. Their grievance? The ban on clothing and how it's affecting the healthcare system in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
*1. "I can't do it anymore!" gasps pharmacist @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ breathlessly, currently squashed up against the elevator doors. "I know wearing clothing is illegal, but I just can't work like this anymore. I had a patient come in looking to get their eczema prescription compounded. Do you know what it was? Coal tar ointment. You ever compound with coal tar? If it gets on your skin, it doesn't come out. I repeat, IT DOESN'T. COME. OUT. My spouse made me sleep on the couch for MONTHS. Please just reverse the ban on clothing. PLEASE." @@LASTNAME_1@@ slides down against the doors and starts weeping. [[color=blue]Marriage is Legal[/color]]

Please just reverse the ban on clothing. PLEASE." @@LASTNAME_1@@ slides down against the doors and starts weeping. [[color=red]Marriage is Illegal[/color]]

3. Comforting @@LASTNAME_1@@ is world-renowned cardiologist @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@ "Look at @@HIM_1@@! Surely you can see the effect that this ban on clothing has on us? And the negative impact it has had on our job performance is nothing compared to the negative impact it has on our patients' outcomes. For example, it is utterly impossible to properly focus on saving a patient's life during a code when you are jam-packed in a tight hospital room with 15-20 other naked individuals! You must reverse the ban on clothing for those of us in the healthcare setting - our patients' lives depend on it."

4. "While reversing the ban on clothing might have Dr. @@LASTNAME_2@@ looking Dr. Fashionista, the problem isn't as bad as @@HE_2@@ makes it out to be", says Nurse @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAMEFEMALE@@ Ratchet, squeezing herself through the crowd to speak to you. "Sure the rooms can get cramped during a Code Blue, but that doesn't mean that we can let our dangly bits distract us when we're cheek-to-cheek saving lives! It just means that we need more funding for our hospitals so we can have larger patient rooms. Here, let me help you write the cheques."

The Issue
Dye effluent from a textile factory has turned the waters of a neighboring river a vivid red, angering nearby residents. The incident has placed the practices of the dye industry and the use of synthetic dyes squarely in the limelight.

The Debate
1. "We can't let this stain our nation any further lest we die!" growls local resident @@RANDOM_NAME@@, using colorful language to emphasize @@HIS@@ point. "Toxic and carcinogenic chemicals are being dumped into our water supply. Ban synthetic dyes and follow the example of us townsfolk: use only natural dyes, as most of them are non-toxic and safer to produce and handle than artificial colorants. All we need is plenty of cleared, arable land for dye production. That, and over three million snails — something to keep the kids occupied, you know."

2. "Sure, natural dyes might sound great, but you're taking this a shade too far," cautions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a dye industry spokesperson. "Think of the environment! We would have to decimate our woodlands and wildlife to fit in dye plantations. Even then, our economy and our clothes would be feeling blue if disaster struck the dye crop. However, I do empathize with those affected by whatever happened. A little 'financial incentive' will help us research and develop safer synthetic dyes."

3. "Lavender lagoons? Scarlet streams? Count me in!" chimes tourism and novelty museum tycoon @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Finding chemicals in the water is anything but a problem; in fact, it's a prime opportunity! We should add a bit of color to our lackluster lakes; the oddly-pigmented oddities would become tourist magnets! Our nation will be known far and wide for its colorful waterways, flowing proudly in our national hues. This, right here, is what will attract more money than anything @@NAME@@ has seen in ages. Let's dye ourselves into the next golden age!"

[b][anchor=1048]#1048[/anchor]: Tatty Treaty Spat Turns Catty [Yahlia; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
University scholars recently made headlines for their discovery that an antiquated treaty between the government and the native Violetstone tribe was never correctly translated into the tribe's language. The treaty - in which the tribe agreed to give up a substantial portion of their native lands - used verb tenses which implied that the agreement was only temporary. Speakers have converged in your office from each of the four directions to give their opinion on the matter.

The Debate
1. Chief Sitting @@ANIMAL@@, elected representative of the Violetstone tribe, paces in front of your desk indignantly. "All my ancestors have been cheated of our sacred land by your people. How are we supposed to thrive on tiny parcels of arid land like Spruce Ridge and Leaning Rock Reservations? I demand that all that was once ours is immediately returned to us, regardless of whether the land is privately or publicly owned. It is our heritage and birthright!"

2. "This simply cannot happen!" proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Housing and Development, after Chief Sitting @@ANIMAL@@ has returned to the sweat lodge that he constructed on your front lawn. "These people are laying claim to productive commercial and industrial zones, along with residential land that was settled by thousands of families. We cannot afford to give up these areas. So what if a few minorities get upset? We need to keep this land, for the prosperity of @@NAME@@!"

3. Your exasperated secretary hurries over to deliver a new folder of issues to you. "Obviously, we can't just return the land; it's too valuable to the country. But we can't ignore these people either; they're too large a percentage of our population to be disregarded." Looking pensive, @@HE@@ pauses for a moment and readjusts @@HIS@@ glasses. "How about we reimburse them another way? A lump sum of a few million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ should settle them down, right?"

4. "Listen to this codswallop!" grumbles your bigoted great-uncle while jotting down a series of misspelled racist slogans in a tattered notebook. "These leeches have contributed nothing worth having to our glorious @@TYPE@@! They're lazy vagrants who create a burden on civilized society. All they do is take drugs and commit crimes. Why not just eject them from the country? Only our race is good enough for @@NAME@@!"

The Issue
Drew Peacock, your Minister for Party Solidarity, has been looking a bit listless lately. It turns out that his doctor has told him that the National Health Service refuses to fund his needed erectile dysfunction medications.

The Debate
1. "This is no laughing matter," moans Minister Peacock. "These days I can barely raise even a smile when I'm with my girl, and it's making our relationship difficult. Sexual health is part of overall wellbeing, and I feel that the NHS should be funding the necessary medications, as well as maybe offering sex counselors and libido clinics. I wouldn't even mind if there was some sort of specialist on hand to show us where we're going wrong."

2. "Look, the NHS is having a hard time as it is," complains general practitioner Dr. Roger Knott stiffly. "We're not here to give leisure drugs for old men's indoor sports. The health service should be focusing on dealing only with diseases and conditions that threaten life and limb. And [i]that[/i] doesn't count as a limb, no matter how proud the good Minister is of it. Okay, here's the deal: let them have four pills per month each. That's a reasonable level of healthcare balanced against a cost-effective prescribing."

[3]. "You got to look at the root problem here, and I'm not talking about the Minister's little thing here," observes visiting United Federation ambassador Ima Meanie. "I'm talking about your socialist medicine. Allow the free market to penetrate the stiff front erected by the communist healthcare entities! It'll be hard on our wallets, but we won't beat it by being soft! By removing medicine from the hands of the government elite, competition will drive down the prices of treatment and drugs, and as a nation I reckon you'll spend a smaller percentage of the national GDP on medical care. That's exactly what things are like in the good ole United Federation, right?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "Maybe you don't need to be in such a hurry to see this as a problem," interjects the minister's wife Ivana Newlove, who has always kept her maiden name. "If the little fella doesn't feel like getting up in the morning, then let him sleep! Drew is almost fifty, for goodness sake; it's only natural that his love life is over. Respect mother nature, and also this tired mother-of-three, and instead ban these treatments." [[color=blue]Must not ban marriages[/color]]

The Issue
A judge from @@CAPITAL@@ recently promised significantly reduced jail time for criminals who volunteer to undergo surgical sterilization. Ten inmates have already agreed to go through with the procedure, and opponents are urging you to step in before more decide to go under the knife.

The Debate
1. "I don't see a cause for concern here," declares the infamous Judge @@RANDOM_NAME@@, notorious for being tough on crime. "It is a fact that the children of criminals are very likely to become criminals themselves. I want to end the cycle of children being born in these despicable, horrible, and awful places. I want to put an end to the violence, theft, rape, and gangsta music in my community. Besides, it's not as if I'm forcing them to do this; criminals make their own choices. And this is a choice that will benefit both the individual and society."

2. "This almost certainly does force prisoners to undergo a procedure," retorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former inmate turned masseuse. "The incarcerated will do everything they can to get out in the least amount of time, even if that means agreeing to a procedure they would never do otherwise. Do I have to explain why it's wrong for the government to sterilize people? The judge probably isn't even allowed to do this sort of thing, and if she is, it definitely should be illegal. What we need to do is give the incarcerated more choices in what they can do in prison, like maybe a good massage every once in a while."

3. "The judge has somethin' right!" grunts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a warden at the @@CAPITAL@@ Correctional Facility who speaks loudly to compensate for carrying a small stick. "We give too dang much freedom to them prisoners. What we need tuh do is take the whole choosing part out and sterilize all of 'em. Once they commit a crime, they lose all them privileges, like the ability to get pregnant or say no."

The Issue
The Maxtopian ambassador @@RANDOM_NAME@@ was recently shipwrecked on @@HIS@@ way to meet with you. Thankfully, your coast guard rescued @@HIM@@ and brought @@HIM@@ safely to your office. @@HE@@ is still angry, however, since @@HE@@ would have preferred to fly into your country if your aircraft ban hadn't stopped @@HIM@@ from doing so.

The Debate
1. "This is wholly unacceptable!" gargles @@HIS@@ Excellency as @@HE@@ wrings out @@HIS@@ still-wet hair, dropping a little anchovy on your carpet. "Do you know how long it takes to get from Maxtopia to @@NAME@@ by boat? Five days! Forgive me, @@LEADER@@, but I don't think it's fair that you have a universal ban on aircraft. Might I propose that diplomatic and governmental aircraft be exempt from the ban? You know, you can keep the riff-raff out of the skies, but top-flight people like you and me should have top-flight privileges."

2. "I'm inclined to agree with you, Your Excellency," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your secretary who used to be an Air @@NAME@@ pilot, with a husky voice. "But I don't think it goes far enough. I think we should unleash the freedom of the skies, unchain the passion of flying, and let all airplanes take us - and our ground-bound economy - to the clouds above!"

3. "Go fly a k-kite!" exclaims stuttering aviophobe @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ emerges from the lunch cart @@HE@@ snuck in on. "Our c-current system is j-just fine.

The Issue
Your secretary wakes you with a phone call at three o'clock in the morning. "Sorry to wake you, @@LEADER@@, but we have a problem. The severe rainy season has overwhelmed flood defences in an isolated northern part of @@NATION@@. Our engineers say we have half an hour before a storm surge sweeps through the region. Almost everyone in the area has been evacuated, with the exception of the inmates and guards at the notorious Zetatraz prison. I've got two officers on the line. Shall I put them through?"

The Debate
1. "We don't have the manpower to evacuate the prison in an orderly fashion!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@ over the sound of pouring rain. "You have to let us open the gates and give the prisoners a chance to get to high ground. Sure, some of these prisoners may be guilty of some serious offenses, but they're still human beings and you cannot leave them to drown! Give the order; I'm sure we'll be able to round them all up once the storm has passed."

2. "Tell me you're joking!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as you hear the heavy clang of keys being turned in old locks. "Zetatraz holds the worst of the worst. Murderers, rapists and jaywalkers crammed into every cell. If we let these animals loose, we're endangering every innocent person in the country.

The Issue
Amid the seemingly perpetual war raging in South Palisade, it appeared that your military personnel were making the most of the situation, and forming close — often physical — relationships with local women. Some even maintained a family off-base. With peace talks in the making, many people are debating the fate of these war brides and children.

The Debate
1. "We must get them back to @@NAME@@," insists Private @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Hammerstein, standing beside his long-time South Palisadian girlfriend as she cradles their infant son. "Have you seen what's happened here? The entire country's been destroyed, and who knows how long this peace agreement will last with those North Palisadians? I don't want my family left behind when the bombs start falling again. It behoves our nation to create an exemption to the immigration ban, to allow our beloved partners and children into @@NAME@@. Do we not have a duty to care for the families of the people who sacrifice everything for its safety?"

2. "Do we not have a duty?" singsongs Major @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Billis, who is rumoured to have fathered twenty-six illegitimate children in twenty-five countries. "I would say that clearly, we do not have a duty. There's nothing like a dame, but if these harlots from other lands are stupid enough to believe that it's love — let alone that love lasts longer than two minutes — that tells me all I need to know about their morals... It also tells me that we cannot allow such people into our country. Of course, our soldiers are upstanding persons of valour and, therefore, should give a financial remittance for any children begotten before they depart."

[3]. "Both these persons are disgusting," sighs Mary @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, Director of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Relationship Relational Service. "A relationship is built on long-term commitment and togetherness. Not picking a girl up because you're sorry for her, and not what that pig was doing either! The compassionate thing is to allow people to bring their war spouses home, but only if they have had a marriage ceremony that is legally binding in @@NAME@@ and have the certificate to prove it.

"These murderous witches always find a back door to kill the poor babies that had the misfortune to be begotten on them! @@LEADER@@, we must ban the sale of the seeds of these accursed plants and immediately form a special police division to eradicate and burn them wherever they grow, salting the earth so they can never sprout again."

2. "Look at my flowers!" interjects Ophelia @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, an eccentric professor of horticulture from @@CAPITAL@@ University, dancing into your room with a basket of flowers. "There's rosemary; that's for remembering. Please remember, love. And there are tansies; they're for removing impurities. There's a daisy - for decorating gardens. How dare you kill flowers? Punish the women who illegally use them to induce abortions, but please let all flowers grow freely." She then puts an amorphophallus titanum on your desk, and leaves the room singing.

3. "I hope you realize that it is not safe to abort a child by using these plants," mutters Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a gynecologist from @@ANIMAL@@ Valley Hospital. "Let's admit it: people will always find ways to circumvent laws that restrict their freedoms. If women are going to have abortions anyway, wouldn't it be better if they had the chance to do so under the supervision of medical professionals? Think about how many lives would be saved if you at least allowed abortions for medical emergencies."

[b][anchor=1055]#1055[/anchor]: Fishy Predictions [Baggieland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The Football Federation Global Cup tournament is in full swing and @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ everywhere have been delighted by the psychic abilities of Pepe the Porpoise, an "animal oracle" resident at @@CAPITAL@@ Zoo. This purported precognitive has — so far — perfectly predicted the winner in every tournament fixture. However, controversy arose yesterday when the animal tipped @@NAME@@ to lose against Skandilund in the quarter-final.

The Debate
1. "How dare that porpoise think that @@NAME@@ could possibly lose to a bunch of sauna-loving, herring-eating liberals who spend half the year in total sunlight and the other half in complete darkness?" fumes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your most patriotic advisor. "There's only one thing to do with this conniving cetacean: send it to the nearest Dàguó restaurant and let's all treat ourselves to some sushi tonight!"

2. "Sushi is fish, and not even from Dàguó, you ignoramus!" points out your pedantic secretary, ironically confusing sushi and sashimi. "Look, there's so many of these animal oracles about that at least one of them was bound to have lucked into the right answers; that doesn't give them any future predictive value. We should just be treating this as harmless fun. Maybe you could run a competition to see which @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ pet has the strongest 'psychic abilities' and award a prize for that."

3. "Pepe has spoken, and we must not blame the messenger for the truths he brings," declares General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, your Chief of Staff. "Real psychics and psychic animals do exist, and we'd be fools not to utilise them to our military advantage. For example, we could put the flags of our adversaries in Pepe's pool to see who is plotting against us, and then preemptively bomb them. Our enemies won't understand how we can anticipate their every move!"

[b][anchor=1056]#1056[/anchor]: Time to Work? [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
After a tired nurse working a hundred-hour week accidentally gave a series of injections to the wrong patient, there have been calls from some for a maximum number of hours someone can work in a week.

The Debate
1. "A rigidly-enforced Working Time Directive should cap anyone from working more than 74 hours 22 minutes per week, with no more than 11.75 hours per shift," definitively states analyst @@RANDOM_NAME@@, presenting you with a stack of hand-written calculations. "This will benefit safety, health, and quality of life, while also creating more jobs within the economy."

2. "I wake, I work, I sleep," sneers multi-millionaire entrepreneur @@RANDOM_NAME@@, attempting to pour himself a cup of coffee from a decorative vase on your desk. "No-one forced me to do this except myself. Turns out though, pushing yourself harder makes you successful. Don't close the door on opportunity by interfering with people's working lives. It's bad for business, and bad for the economy."

3. "Let's strike a reasonable middle ground!" proposes your hyperactive Employment Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, striking a 'middle ground pose' that involves balancing on one leg while pointing rapidly in multiple directions. "We need a comprehensive review to identify professions where there is risk to the public from long hours, and then create tailored directives for each field of work, and then create allowances for longer weeks followed by time off, and limited opt out clauses for extenuating circumstances, and, and... that sounds fun! Let's get started!" @@HE@@ skips off, giggling maniacally.

The Issue
This winter, harsh blizzards have hit the high-latitude regions of @@NAME@@. Many residents have contracted hypothermia while shovelling their sidewalks. The surviving citizens are begging you to lift the ban on clothes.

The Debate
1. Meteorologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ shivers while predicting another snowstorm. "@@LEADER@@, you must r-r-relegalize clothing unless you want your people to fr-r-reeze. So many of us have already succumbed to hypothermia and the flu-u-u... achoo! And I'm afraid I'm next."

2. Naked window washer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ grins as @@HE@@ flashes you. "Don't listen to that fearmonger; nudity is the best thing you've done in years! I've always wanted to see my co-workers' bodies, and that dream is now a reality thanks to you. If these people are too pathetic to survive the cold winters, then they can just migrate to the warmer parts of @@NAME@@ and live with us. Sure, it might be a little crowded, but we will finally get to see if those frigid @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are as beautiful as people say they are."

3. Surfer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ bursts through your door, dripping with water and trailing seaweed. "Dude, you can't just leave the colder parts of @@NAME@@ unattended and expect everything to be fine! All you need to do is pump carbon dioxide stuff into the atmosphere and then we can have an endless summer. Like, some of those environment losers say it will cause pollution, but who would want to miss out on that heat?"

The Issue
A new administrative building for the Environmental Department is under fire from watchdog groups. An investigation found — among other things — that valuable wetland was drained for the foundation, unsustainable materials were used during construction, and energy-inefficient methods were chosen for the mechanical systems.

The Debate
1. "The government needs to do better," tuts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an activist protesting outside the department building. "All government agencies must be required to undergo an environmental impact assessment before any proposed action — building or otherwise. Not only do agencies need to report critical habitat affected as well as embodied energy costs for materials, et cetera; they must be required to follow the most environmentally friendly option possible. If even one thing is found out of place, a project shouldn't be allowed to go through. The conservation benefits are certainly worth it in the end."

2. "There's no way that our government could afford the highest level of environmental certifications on every government building!" excitedly cautions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Treasury Minister. "However, I do realize the need for our nation to be environmentally responsible. Go through with mandating a permitting process, but only for non-government construction! Let us take over the process of awarding green certification so that we can charge fees for everyone. This will be great for our nation's treasury and our environment!"

3. "There's no reason to go through with this," urges your Minister of Housing whilst urinating on a potted plant. "In fact, I say we teach these radical hippies a lesson. I have a list of the fragile habitats surrounding @@CAPITAL@@, home to some useless endangered snail species that no one cares about except these annoying tree huggers. I've also got three orders filed for United Federation granite — I hear they recently opened up one of their national parks for mining. Just say the word, and these ecofascists will be living their worst nightmare. Maybe then they'll get the message."

[b][anchor=1059]#1059[/anchor]: Footing the Bill [Baggieland & Pogaria; ed: Baggieland & Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
Despite spending copious amounts of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to turn the nation into a Calvinball powerhouse, @@NAME@@ finished in last place at the very next tournament. Some are now beginning to wonder if this money was well-spent.

The Debate
1. "Clearly we haven't spent enough!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Calvinball expert who reportedly has the world's only complete set of time-fracture wickets. "What we need to do is build the newest, state-of-the-art academies in every city. Even successful Calvinball countries like Ausblic will be in awe of them! If we build world-class facilities with pitches for every season, fitness and rehab centres, and the finest Skandilundian-designed saunas, we will finally achieve our dream of Calvinball superiority! Double the funding!"

2. "So what have we spent this money on?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head coach of the highly successful Chagrin Marauders. "We relaid a few pitches, bought some new equipment and built a couple of training centres. Yet, our players did worse than last time! We need to make sure that any kid who displays any sporting aptitude doesn't slip through the net. Force all children into mandatory attendance at these training centres. Their educational needs are secondary to our quest for Calvinball glory!"

3. "Our current crop of so-called 'world-class' players has clearly failed, despite all the money we threw at them," opines @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who grimaces every time @@HE@@ hears the official Calvinball song. "Forget about this rabble and instead transfer the funding to the professional development of our youngsters. We can create new youth clubs and leagues, and let's just forget about all this 'let's turn @@NAME@@ into a Calvinball powerhouse' nonsense. Encouraging kids to exercise and maintain good health is far more important than pursuing a hopeless dream. If the kids turn out to be world champions years down the line, then that's just a bonus."

4. "Listen," states your younger brother, the glint in his eye indicating that he has just come up with another harebrained idea. "Everything we've tried hasn't worked so far, so why not enact a program to kidnap all the best players and coaches from around the world? Bring them back to @@NAME@@ and force them at gunpoint to train and develop our athletes. All our players will then be able to improve their game from the skills and techniques of our kidnapees. Calvinball glory will soon be ours!"
