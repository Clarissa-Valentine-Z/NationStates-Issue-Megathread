[b][anchor=1700]#1700[/anchor]: My Heart Will Go On [Raionitu; ed: Raionitu][/b]

The Issue
The death of a local priest turned even more sour when the priest's congregation hid the body to prevent it from being taken away for mandatory organ harvesting, citing their religious beliefs as a reason to refuse officials. Facing legal action, the distraught faithful have appealed to you to intervene, sparking a debate at the crossroads of religious liberties and public health.

The Debate
1. "What tribulations we must face in the afterlife in the name of progress!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Katamic Order. "In death, our hearts must be weighed upon the scales of Justice. If we cannot bear our hearts with us, we must instead face many trials to prove our worthiness to sail up the golden river. And it's not just us, countless religions demand their followers remain whole in death as in life. Please, I beg you, allow religious exemptions in matters such as this."

2. "Oh look, another pretentious preacher asking for special treatment because of their imaginary friend," spits political activist Ai Thist. "What about those of us who want a say in what happens to our bodies for real reasons? I've heard stories about doctors letting patients die so they can harvest the organs to save family members. Do you really think the benefits really outweigh the risks? Instead of giving exemptions for select groups, end mandatory organ donation entirely, give the people back ownership of their dead."

3. "People want this choice everywhere, but you can't allow them to opt out of the nation's wellbeing," counters your Minister of Health. "Just last week I saw a dozen parents refuse to have their children vaccinated! Just look at the state @@NAME@@ was in before this policy was implemented, organ waiting lists were miles long. We are saving lives here. Make vaccines mandatory as well, give the government more power to enforce health mandates, and make our national policy clear: religious beliefs don't overrule the greater good."

4. The jingling of metal alerts you to a bizarre figure entering your office; it's the sound of hundreds of earrings that have been strung into a necklace. "Oh no, the government is trying to control what happens to your body after you die, boo hoo," mocks the stranger, who despite the jewelry isn't actually pierced. "Forget about helping the deadbeats, what about how the government is controlling our bodies while we're still alive? We should be allowed to get piercings and tattoos and all those other beautiful forms of self expression." [[color=blue]Must have Body Integrity[/color]] 

*5. The minister is interrupted by a soft tutting coming through the door. "Just look at how selfish people are with their bodies. And not just this misguided attempt to hoard organs in death," sighs conservative religious preacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing robes that cover everything but @@HIS@@ eyes. "Go outside and look around, circumcision, tattoos, piercings. These people claim to care about their bodies when cutting them saves lives, yet everyday @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ are butchering their bodies for selfish, vain reasons. The people have proved they can't be trusted with a choice. It is long past time the government stepped in and banned cosmetic body alterations." [[color=red]Must not have Body Integrity[/color]]

The Issue
During a spectacular meteor shower last night, scientists spotted a particularly large asteroid that could potentially collide with the planet on its next close approach. Although it won't pose a threat for years, the situation has caused an uproar in the scientific community over how to deal with such threats.

The Debate
1. "Such a global threat requires astronomical measures!" shouts Minister of Defense @@RANDOM_NAME@@, slamming your office door open with enough force to damage the wall. "Bigger threats require bigger bombs, plain and simple! If any hunk a' rock looks like it might cause problems, simply use everything in our arsenal to blow it to smithereens and send it back to where no man has gone before. Besides, it's much easier to deal with a million tiny rocks than a single biggun."

2. "Death by a thousand cuts is still death!" retorts astronomer Curt Gesagt, covering the damaged wall with a duck-themed calendar. "We should focus on diverting potentially dangerous asteroids with less explosive options like simply slamming probes into them with enough force to change their orbits. Now, all it's going to take is a whole lot of funding and several months of logisti..." He's suddenly interrupted as a rock violently smashes through your office window and part of the floor, nearly taking out his leg.

3. "Oh, we can do so much better than wasting our potential on that!" spouts renowned economist Ellen Nusk, pulling your favorite rug over the new crater in your floor. "Think of all the raw material in these asteroids: iron, copper, and even gold so beyond your wildest dreams that we could even phase out terrestrial mining altogether! Granted, all of this is entirely theoretical and obscenely expensive, but we can't afford to waste such a perfect opportunity just sending these treasure troves back into the void — AAGH!" Her speech is forcefully concluded as the now flaming rug sets her pants alight.

4. "I think we're all being a little too hasty here," begins skeptic researcher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pouring your cup of coffee onto the burning rug. "You're all forgetting one crucial detail: the data is terribly incomprehensive, limiting the reliability of our simulations — the asteroid could very well miss us by millions of miles! It's high time we start collecting more and more reliable data, as all those plans are useless if we can't plan appropriately." He starts towards your door before turning back. "Is there a fire extinguisher around here?"

The Issue
Excited ecologists have discovered that the Bone Estuary is home to a previously undiscovered colony of horseshoe crabs. Horseshoe crab blood is a highly valued source of limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL), an important component in the production of vaccines and other medical equipment.

The Debate
1. "This is an amazing opportunity for the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ pharmaceutical sector," enthuses biochemist Vladimir Tepez, impaling a nearby horseshoe crab on a kebab skewer. "If you could grant us permission to set up a laboratory and exsanguination facility on the estuary, you'll grow a lucrative industry and add to our armoury against future pandemics. Invite us in! You must invite us in!"

2. "Laboratory-synthesised genetically engineered recombinant factor fulfills all the same purposes as LAL," babbles Professor Abraham Vonel-Singh, whose pungent aroma fills the room with the scent of garlic. "Ecological protections for vulnerable crab populations are essential, and even if horseshoe crab blood is cheaper, it's a small cost for the government to subsidise artificial reagents. Keep the estuary virginal and pristine, keep those bloodsuckers away and everyone will benefit. I stake my reputation on it!"

*3. "Whoa, that's, like, total nonsense, dude," interrupts Jonny Nemo Nick Harker, who is supposedly a respected solicitor, but seems somewhat unconvincing in the role. "If we're gonna waste these shelly dudes, we shouldn't waste them on science stuff, right? I mean, these little guys are totally delicious. Invite me and my boys in, set up some barbecues, and chow down. All we are is dust in the wind, so let's blow out on a big party! Most excellent, dude!" [Not vegetarian]

I know we aren't supposed to eat meat or nothing, but if you let me and my boys chow down, that'd be, like, radical, man. All we are is dust in the wind, so let's blow out on a big party!

The Issue
A spat of reported issues with hitchhiking culminated in a nationally publicized abduction of someone's favorite teddy bear while in a stranger's car. In other news, Striving Millers' Better Sandwiches, a diner at 115 @@ANIMAL@@ton Road, is scheduled for demolition to make way for a new bypass. While trying to take your mind off things and enjoy your final sandwich there, an infinitely improbable crew of vagabonds and managers who're all thumbs pass through in much the same way bricks don't.

The Debate
1. Phillip Bentwood, your sandwich maker for the day, latches onto your knees, obviously having already sobbed for the last fifteen minutes. "They took my teddy bear... THE FIENDS! I even have a car on loan — I just needed to get home because someone left me at the grocery store! All of the rides I've given myself, and this is how I'm treated in my time of need? Hitchhiking is a dangerous risk for everyone involved, and you must put a stop to it, and spread the word of the dangers of getting into another's vehicle. It's a cruel and unfair world out there!"

2. A man of Bigtopian ancestry hitching a ride on a shopping cart crashes through the front glass doors, careening beside you. "Adam Douglas, pleased to meet you! You know, people shouldn't be so afraid of giving lifts — it's mostly harmless! Plus, it's really useful when someone doesn't have a car, or can't drive. Say, @@LEADER@@, you lead things, right? You could encourage people to carpool and lend rides. It wouldn't cost you much, would promote social goodwill, and could probably reduce emissions if that's what you're into." He throws his dish towel over his shoulder while mounting his shopping cart full of sandwiches. "So long, Phil, and thanks for all the fill."

*3. "Don't listen to Mr. Lord Perfect Answer-to-Everything over here," mutters Maverick Bronco, the owner of Trillion Asterisks Motors in a monotone voice. "That babbling fishlips is missing the bigger problem — we need more affordable cars to reduce hitchhikers. What better way than the government subsidizing the automotive industry and slashing red tape?

"What if we like, put a limit on using cars? Eh? And make people like, use buses, and like trains. Heh... 4-wheel to 8-wheel, amirite?" He makes a dumb smirk as Zephyr interjects, "Yes! We'll make it infinitely improbable for travelers to get hurt! I'm so smart! Oh hey Phil, sorry for leaving you at the shop a few days back. I totally didn't steal anything!"

[b][anchor=1704]#1704[/anchor]: Rainbow Disconnections [Ostrovskiy; ed: The Ankhalic Vaspriot][/b]

The Issue
It's election year in Brancaland, a country which has a significant amount of trade with @@NAME@@. The incumbent president has made a promise to support rights for homosexuals abroad, and as they scramble to secure a second term, their administration has threatened sanctions on War Dogs XI due to your laws against homosexuality.

The Debate
1. "Look, @@LEADER@@, Brancaland doesn't want a trade war," begins the Brancalandian ambassador, replacing the miniature flag on your desk with a rainbow version. "All we're asking you to do is simply nix your anachronistic laws criminalizing homosexuality. If that's done, we won't impose any sanctions and your industries won't suffer any damage. If it isn't, well, you've brought this on yourself."

2. "Well," replies @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your advisor and a former police officer. "Just because Brancaland is threatening sanctions doesn't mean we should compromise the integrity of our laws. However, the economic threat is very much real. Why don't we create a queer liaison — someone who can 'work for the gay community of @@NAME@@' and pretend that we're fostering dialogue while we continue to enforce the ban? The position will be totally toothless, of course, but the president doesn't know that."

3. Your door is suddenly kicked down by the popular anti-queer personality @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, turning his furious gaze on you. "@@LEADER@@, you can't allow this foreign subversion!" he bellows. "Our culture is being destroyed by the enemy within and without: homosexuals and their supporters. We cannot give in to these unnatural degenerates or allow them to influence the decisions of this country. Cut off all diplomatic and economic relations with those nations that permit homosexuality so that they may face the consequences of their ungodliness!"

[b][anchor=1705]#1705[/anchor]: Taken Out Back [Kractero; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
A critical vulnerability in PB Utils, a core open-source software on many government computers in @@NAME@@, has been linked to a backdoor inserted by the project's new maintainer.

The Debate
1. "The reality is that many projects like mine rely on a handful of people who volunteer our time, and burnout and stress is real," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the former person in charge of the compromised software. "I worked on that software for years, but I needed to step away for mental health. The new maintainer had been helping out for a while and I trusted them to take over. Clearly, I was manipulated, and it's been a long time coming. We can't expect projects like mine to run off just goodwill. Organizations that depend on them should contribute back, with funding ideally."

*2. We rely on open-source projects," shrugs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of SynCity, the technology firm which found the backdoor. "Our profit margins are razor thin as is. You can't possibly expect us to waste money propping up every small project. Frankly, you should be glad our engineers caught the backdoor during routine checks. If these volunteers can't keep their houses in order, then it might be time we help the industry adopt a set of standards for these kinds of audits, with our oversight, of course." [has private industry]

*3. "We rely on open-source," scoffs one of your system administrators, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, through a thick unruly beard. "You can't possibly expect us to waste taxpayer money propping up every small project. Frankly, you should be glad our engineers caught the backdoor during routine checks. If these volunteers can't keep their houses in order, then it's time we adopted a set of standards for these kinds of audits. I'd be happy to spearhead it." [does not have private industry]

4. "Why in Sam Hill are we're letting random strangers write software that ends up in our national infrastructure?" snaps national security hawk @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as a prominent vein in @@HIS@@ forehead bulges. "All of our software should be developed in house by trusted and vetted government employees, not outsourced to code monkeys, period. And I'm hearing whispers that this may have been the work of a state actor. If Dàguó or Blackacre think that they can worm their way into our systems, then it's high time we slip into theirs."

5. "You know, this wouldn't happen if we still used pen and paper for everything," mutters your Luddite secretary, finishing a ledger with a quill pen. "Maybe it's time that critical systems, like the government and banks, switch back to analog. You can't infiltrate paper."

The Issue 
During @@HIS_1@@ first public speech your new Minister of Environment, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, stated @@HIS_1@@ mission was to make @@NAME@@ the greenest nation in @@REGION@@, starting with the power grid. @@HE_1@@ then went on a two-hour rant about corrupt corporate executives who knowingly sacrifice the environment for personal gain, and has continued @@HIS_1@@ rant to you in person.

The Debate
1. "We've played cat and mouse long enough!" fumes Minister @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@ as @@HE_1@@ slams carbon emission reports on your desk. "We've asked them nicely over and over again, but they didn't listen. Now let's give them something they can't ignore: ban the construction of new coal plants, put tariffs on imported oil, and impose crushing fines for non-compliance. Power plants can either go green or go broke."

2a. "Let's not be too harsh here." argues Bruno Cole, CEO of @@NAME@@ Gas and Electric, as he slides a "donation" to the Minister. "Renewable energy sources are still far more expensive than their traditional counterparts, we obviously need more time to convert to green energy. The technology isn't there yet and all our infrastructure is built for fossil fuels. Fund more research on power generation, but banning coal now would just hurt the common @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@."

2b. "Let's not be too harsh here." argues Burl Cole, Minister of Energy, as he tucks his "donations" away. "Renewable energy sources are still far more expensive than their traditional counterparts, we obviously need more time to convert to green energy. The technology isn't there yet and all our infrastructure is built for fossil fuels. Fund more research on power generation, but banning coal now would just hurt the common @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@."

3a. "We already [i]have[/i] a green energy source that is compatible with our current infrastructure, but because of that [i]one[/i] incident in East Lebatuck 50 years ago..." mutters nuclear scientist Lisa Bakker "Nuclear energy is far safer now than ever, and with your support we can be the nuclear superpower of the world! That came out wrong, we can be the glowing green, the uh..." the scientist trails off while trying to think of a positive catchphrase.

4. "Why are we trying to change our old traditions anyway?" grumbles @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Collier, coughing out black dust. "Coal and oil powered our nation for generations and now suddenly they're 'bad for the environment'? We need to embrace our heritage! Teach the children about the importance of fossil fuels, make national holidays for it. Let's be the fossil fuel capital of the world!"

The Issue
After attending a graduation ceremony at the local courthouse for newly-graduated parole officers, a news broadcast nearby flashed a security clip of a just-released crew of criminals robbing a bank a mere three hours out of @@CAPITAL@@ Penitentiary. Wardens, reformers, and hard-liners have flooded the cordon with demands for you to stop the high rate of recidivism.

The Debate
1. "Once a criminal, always a criminal," grumbles prison warden @@RANDOM_NAME@@, infamous for subjecting unlucky inmates to hours of 'Mick-Rolling', "These criminals are dangerous and deceptive people, and despite our best efforts, they inevitably lose control once they go outside the structure we provide. But when they're inside, they can't reoffend. I say we at least double the prison sentences of all new inmates. A few extra decades of staring at concrete will do wonders for public safety!"

2. "More prison time? If anything, we need less," complains ex-convict @@RANDOM_NAME@@, kicking at a loose floor tile. "Rotting in a box only teaches boredom and bitterness. What we need is a short stay in a proper rehabilitation campus, with comfy beds, good food, and trained massage therapists, so we leave with skills instead of scars. If you slash sentence lengths and divert the savings into renovating our prisons, you'll get fewer re-offenders. Sounds fair, @@LEADER@@?"

[3]. "Incentives are the root behind all problems," observes Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, behavioural economist at the @@NAME@@ Institute for Public Policy, drawing a line graph with @@HIS@@ fingers. "Private prisons are usually paid per occupied bed, so they earn more money when offenders return, which is bad for society. I propose we privatise operations, but under performance-based contracts, where prisons are rewarded for keeping recidivism low: the operator earns money for each released inmate who does not re-offend, and pays a penalty for every relapse. Best of all, if something goes wrong, we can blame the prison operator and tax them away!" [[color=blue]Must have Capitalism[/color] / [color=red]Must not have Socialism[/color] - TBC]

[4]. "Pain is the greatest teacher," snaps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a veteran principal rapping a wooden ruler against @@HIS@@ palm. "In my classroom, consequences land before the ink is dry, and even the most inattentive pupils learn to behave. Criminals are no different; they don't plan for years, they react to tomorrow. Replace all prison terms with canings delivered the next day, paired with restitution and supervised work release. The lesson is immediate and the cost is low. Deterrence works best when it stings." [[color=blue]Must have Corporal Punishment [TBC][/color]]

5. "You're all a bunch of naïve, softy bureaucrats!" roars @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a seasoned law enforcement officer in a faded raid jacket. "Why should society foot the bill for a bunch of good-for-nothings, when we could just get rid of them? Dirty scumbags like them deserve no quarter — death is the only permanent cure for this pandemic of criminal injustice. Just leave it to me, @@LEADER@@. My fellow men and I will send all of those morally ill convicts to the promised land! Remember, there's more than one way to strangle a goose, or should I say, strangle an inmate."

The Issue
During a televised address earlier today, you were abruptly cut off after an electromagnetic burst from the sun deactivated communication satellites above @@NAME@@. While cable TV viewers were panicking, experts have been quick to warn that future solar storms of larger magnitudes could be devastating to critical services and public infrastructure.

The Debate
1. "Finally, it's my time to shine!" whoops your energetic Minister of Infrastructure Research and Development, Lester Knorpf, radiating excitement as he dumps a stack of thick binders labeled 'Fun in the Sun — Not so Fun!' on your desk. "Alright, I've compiled several detailed reports on how we can avoid being blindsided again — step one, apply sunscreen! Er, I mean, give @@CAPITAL@@ University those grants for solar observational telescopes they've been begging for. Follow up with research funding towards upgrading the resilience of our current satellite array! I bet how brilliant I am is beginning to dawn on you, eh?" He beams expectantly. "Tough crowd, huh? Well, the sun's barely risen."

2. "That sounds shockingly expensive," comments an electrician, who is installing a new lamp on your desk. "There's no need to waste @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ on such a convoluted and costly project. Just watt happens when there's no power getting to televisions? Invest in current solutions. Install auxiliary power transformers, upgrade power lines, and revamp our energy distribution system — that way, in the event of a solar storm, we can keep the power transformers from overloading and keep the lights on. There's an efficient and direct solution... no re-volting alternatives for us."

3a. "Are you naïve?" cries conspiracy theorist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as she shoves the electrician aside and begins dismantling your lamp to search for spy ants. "Some terrorist could pose as an engineer and sabotage the grid just like that! We need something that can stop the solar storms before they reach us. The only way to shield us from electromagnetic attacks is to install mesh metal barriers around every city. As a bonus, it'll stop East Lebatuck from reading our thoughts. Only then can we be truly safe!" [[color=blue]Nust have Private Industry[/color]]

4. "Now hold on a minute — explain to me again why I need you to protect me from the sun?" grumbles your leathery-skinned uncle, shuffling into the room. "Back in my day, we didn't worry about things we couldn't control. If there were disasters that we couldn't prevent, we just drilled for those events. Stop entertaining nonsense and make the whole nation practice for things like blackouts. Reminds me of before you were around when…" He begins to recollect some vague memories that, honestly, no one is really paying attention to.

The Issue
Data from insurance companies, sales lots, @@NAME_INITIALS@@DMV offices, and other sources indicates fewer young adults are getting cars or driver's licenses. A meeting has been arranged with several people involved with the auto business to discuss this trend.

The Debate
1. "I know just the solution," announces CyberSedan manufacturer Freon Husk after smashing your door with the newest CyberSedan model, whose bumper promptly falls off. "Young folks want to drive, but pointless government regulations and taxes make it too expensive to afford a car. You have to increase efficiency, like I did for your door. Slash regulation, make licenses easier to get, reduce vehicle registration taxes, and we'll see the youth back on the road in no time!"

2. "That guy's got it all wrong!" exclaims used-car salesman @@RANDOM_NAME@@, picking up the bumper from the CyberSedan to put on another car. "Sure, cost may be the problem, but we can't just throw away our law books and fill the road with deathtraps. You should provide cheap loans for people who want to buy a car, and subsidize small businesses across @@NAME@@ — the kinds of trendy places where the youth will actually want to drive to. In order to prevent abuse, of course, you should provide better rates for used cars, especially from lots owned by those who have provided such excellent advice to you." @@HE@@ flashes you a practiced smile and a wink.

3. "Dear child," interjects renowned sociologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "the youth don't drive because they have no need to drive. Most childless couples can flexibly time their trips. But once kids arrive, the day turns into daycare–school–doctor–pharmacy ping-pong — a chain of tightly scheduled events requiring strollers and baby seats that only cars can accommodate. If you truly wish to bring back the glory days of the automobile industry, you must encourage those in @@NAME@@ to settle down sooner."

4. "The next generation doesn't want to own cars? So what?" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a famous climate activist and avid BMX enthusiast, doing a 360 jump on a rented bike over the leaving salesman. "We're just finally waking up to how damaging cars are to the environment. This trend is a perfect opportunity to push us into a green future.
