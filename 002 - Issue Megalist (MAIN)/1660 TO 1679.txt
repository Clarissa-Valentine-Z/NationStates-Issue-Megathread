[b][anchor=1660]#1660[/anchor]: The Plight of the Doomscrollers [Western Balkania; ed: Kaschovia][/b]

The Issue
The rapid rise of short-form content consumption in @@NAME@@ has been marked by an alarming uptick in reports of academic deficiency, spiralling attention spans, and concerns about data privacy. A loose coalition of parents and educators are vehemently rallying against the impact that this highly addictive strain of entertainment is having and are petitioning for the government to take action.

The Debate
1. "This is the downfall of the next generation, I tell you... " pleads overprotective mother Kai Sims, clutching her eight-year-old son like a baby. "@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ kids are flunking school and have no interest in anything other than those mindless videos! Platforms like ShortTok, WhoTube Shorts, and Flipstagram Reals are rotting away the minds of our future citizens and turning them into zombies! The most sensible solution here is to outlaw them once and for all and get those kids outside again! Think of th— " She swats the child's hand away as he reaches for your secretary's phone.

2. An awkward teenager with facial blemishes and broccoli-shaped hair scrolls through ShortTok for 17 seconds before realizing where he is. After a moment, he mumbles, "Firstly, let us watch whatever we want. Like, dude, I thought this was a freedom-having nation. If you ban short videos, that would be going against our rights and freedoms, wouldn't it? Fourthly, ShortTok actually, like, educates and teaches people. School sucks, but these videos have... a bunch of infor... m... action. Check this one out." He mutters something truly unintelligible before taking off, bumping into several people on his way out.

3. "Just banning the apps that distribute short-form content is far too modest," scoffs Yggdrasil Academy history teacher Oprah Berlusconi, previously cautioned for physical misconduct against a student. "Why do these youngins even need them dastardly small-screen doohickies? Just look at what they've done to him! They're the root of all the decay with young people in this day and age. Those devices poison you when you're still blooming; they strangle you by the neck, take your attention and consciousness hostage, and rob you of your precious time on our nation's great, green pastures! Ban minors from using 'smart' devices altogether and put those who don't comply behind bars!"

4. "Listen, I really don't care what people watch, but I'm certainly wary of malicious foreign actors!" exclaims full-time conspiracist and part-time sixty-three-year-old Nigel Lincoln, waving mini @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ flags in your face. "D'ya wanna know who owns the parent company of the ever-so dubious ShortTok? That's right... Dàguó! Their 'privacy' policy is over seven-hundred pages long for a reason... so they can harvest the data of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizens who don't read it! Don't even get me started on that Flipstagram shmuck Karl Muckstaberg or whatever his name is... in my mind there's only one fitting solution: ban foreign social media apps completely and mandate the creation of fully @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ government run platforms, for the sake of the @@TYPE@@!"

[b][anchor=1661]#1661[/anchor]: Payback's a Witch [Kissinger-Monroe; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
In one of the wildest and least known districts of @@NAME@@, belief in magic is common. Whenever a rural villager needs an incantation to bring about personal success or a hex to destroy an enemy, there is always a witch to fulfill that need, provided payment is received. Some residents are claiming that they have been swindled by these witches, but efforts by local authorities to crack down on witchcraft have failed.

The Debate
1. The local mayor, Hobbes Stoughton, pleads, "People have been scammed by these so-called witches. I have tried to enforce civil justice, but the hags can't be seized and brought to answer for the hurt they do; as they threaten anybody who tries to apprehend them with curses. Our townsfolk believe in their powers and are afraid to do anything. On top of that, these women are running illegal businesses, earning untaxed income! Set up national tribunals and burn them at the stake!"

2. While sticking pins into an effigy of Mr. Stoughton and lighting it on fire, Fiolxhilde, Witch of the East, responds, "Do not forget... my spells are capable of both good and evil! I help the common folk with their problems, and I am very popular for it. But now the mayor has gotten together a few liars to say that they've been duped! It's just a ploy to snatch all I've earned! @@LEADER@@, I foresee you holding on to power for many more years, but only with my support. Encourage the public to turn to witches for help in their lives, and you'll see that my prophecies are never wrong. I accept payment in the form of gold bars and eyes of newt."

3. A man holding a long wand points it at the witch, declaring, "I myself was a victim of your crimes, you harpy. You once sold me a love potion that didn't work! But behold, I, Priaspuro, have immersed myself in the study of magick and am now the greatest wizard in @@NAME@@! @@LEADER@@, allow me to form a party of warlocks to make battle with the witches, mana a mana! With their confiscated riches, we can establish a board to regulate the black magic market and prevent these women from cheating us all. We shall call ourselves the Keepers of the Sacred Gate. Anybody would be able to practice magick as a profession, but he must pay his taxes and only perform approved tasks."

[b][anchor=1662]#1662[/anchor]: Divine Dining [Frieden-und freudenland; ed: Klaus Devestatorie][/b]

The Issue
The annual feast day of the Bluebark tribe, Azure Wednesday, is fast approaching. The festival calls for the communal consumption of @@ANIMAL@@ stew as a re-enactment of the myth wherein Azura, the ancestral goddess of the tribe, bestowed the Earth upon humanity after defeating and devouring a celestial @@ANIMAL@@. Consumption of @@ANIMAL@@ meat is prohibited in @@NAME@@, but sources report that the Bluebark tribe has never stopped hunting @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ for Azure Wednesday.

The Debate
1. "Will somebody PLEASE think of the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@?" clamours @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a member of the @@CAPITAL@@ Nature Conservationists' Association, wearing a jacket covered in @@ANIMAL@@-themed enamel pins. "With all due respect, any mythology the Bluebark tribe has attached to our national animal is beside the point — our @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ deserve a place in our hearts, not our stomachs! We need a special police task force to track down these butchers and punish them!"

2. "Respect our great-great-great-great-grandmother Azura, the creator and eternal protector of our blue-tinted mountains!" chants Chieftain @@RANDOM_NAME@@, swinging an incense burner puffing cerulean smoke. "What happened to the values of tribal freedom and tolerance in this country? Azure Wednesday is one of our most important holidays, and banning us from sacrificing @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ on this day means disrespect and disdain for our ancient traditions. The consumption of @@ANIMAL@@ meat for ritual worship must be permitted."

3. "MURDER!" shrieks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a bovine psychiatry student at @@CAPITAL@@ University, carrying a cardboard protest sign covered in text too small to read. "Why do we only care about @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@? Untold thousands of innocent creatures are slaughtered every day to please the bottomless appetite of the human virus! If you're for real about caring for the well-being of animals, release every farm animal from their cages and fields! It's time to make this country completely vegetarian!" [[color=red]Must not have compulsory vegetarianism[/color]]

4. "All this drama just serves to confirm that religion is stupid," declares podcaster @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Are we genuinely expected to tolerate their belief that the world was dominated by @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@, and that a so-called 'goddess' killed and ate them, and then gave the world to us? Yeah, sure. If anyone in our government ever feels like using logic and reason for once, we should ban all religions, tribal or not, and put an end to this madness."
