[b][anchor=340]#340[/anchor]: Defending Patent Pending [Panageadom; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
Pear Industries, one of @@NAME@@'s largest consumer electronics companies, wishes to bring a lawsuit against a small technology firm for making use of a piece of electronics they developed. The smaller firm is imploring the government to maintain its recent anti-copyright laws, which they claim legally extend to patents.

The Debate
1. "Patents are simply a tool for large companies to abuse entrepreneurs and the consumer!" argues small-time inventor and part-time champagne socialist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "They use their huge legal departments to muscle out any smaller company that might 'pose a threat'. The government's ban of patents gave us all access to the advances those fat-cats have been sitting on all these years. You want to throw that all away so some guy can add a few more zeros to the end of his bank account?"

2. "My team poured years of research and millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ into developing this component," claims Pear's dressed-down CEO, Steve Tasks. "It's our blood, sweat and tears that led to this breakthrough. You must allow companies greater claim over their discoveries. We need patents. We need copyrights. They are the incentive that keeps inventors inventing. Reinstate patents and copyrights or @@NAME@@'s research will come to a stand-still and our country a technological backwater devoid of any semblance of innovation."

3. "The only thing that's clear from this is that SCIENCE isn't getting enough funding," grumbles eminent, if notoriously disaffected, physicist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The only reason we have to spend so much effort protecting our discoveries is because we're so worried about where our next paycheck is coming from. If the government opened up its coffers to eager scientists, this whole debate would simply go away. Not to mention that government could lay claim to any particularly intriguing discoveries..."

The Issue
After their daughter wandered off into the woods behind her house, a pair of teary-eyed parents interrupts one of your meetings, beseeching you to step up the rescue effort.

The Debate
1. "She's only t-t-three years old!" sobs the lost girl's mother. "She'll never make it out there in the wilderness all alone. She's going to d- d- d-" Her husband steps in as she breaks down in tears: "Please, you have to do something! There aren't enough rescue workers out there. You need to hire more or divert them from other areas or something! What's more important than a child's safety?"

2. "Hmph!" scoffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your miffed financial advisor. "The nerve of some people! Do you really want to squander all that money on one kid? If you're stupid enough to walk off into the forest all by yourself, maybe you shouldn't make it to adulthood to have your own stupid kids. Survival of the fittest never hurt anyone – anyone worthwhile that is. We need to get rid of this unnecessary safety net. No more rescue teams. Then maybe parents will actually watch their moron kids."

*[3]. "Search teams are just too inefficient," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Eye See You Surveillance. "Thousands of citizens searching high and low with no promise of success. Now what we need to do is implant GPS tracking devices into all citizens. Think about it! No more lost kids, no more fugitives, no more alibis.

If we chop down those damned woods, well then there won't be anythin' to get lost in, now will there? You give me and my team the OK, and we'll make those wooded deathtraps a thing o' the past!"

[b][anchor=342]#342[/anchor]: This Land Was Made For You And Me [Luna Amore; ed: Kryozerkia][/b]

The Issue
A recent government report revealed that @@NAME@@ is running out of land for its expanding population. An emergency meeting of your advisors has been called to decide the best course of action. 

The Debate
1. "The solution is simple and something we should have been doing all along," states your Minister of the Environment, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "We have acres upon acres of land that is tied up in landfills. If we compost, compress, recycle, we can use the newly-cleaned land to build eco-friendly housing developments. Yes, it'll require a lot of funding, and there's bound to be at least a little residual smell. People won't be happy about it, but I guarantee they'll be a damn sight happier than they'd be on the streets!" 

2. "Of course the enviro-nutjob wants to clean up the landfills, but that's not the issue!" says your Minister of Finance, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why spend all that money fixing up land that already has a purpose when we've got plenty of worthless national parks? We could start construction sooner, get people moved in sooner, and fix this problem sooner. We could even use the resources in the parks to furnish the houses. It'd give our timber industry a much needed boost. I'm sure the hippies will moan about how that'll destroy a bunch of 'delicate habitats', but it's simply progress, @@LEADER@@." 

*3. "You're all not thinking this through!" yells the CEO of Yellowcake Depot, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We've still got plenty of land. We've only used the top of it after all. Let's expand our cities underground. Look at the perks: there's plenty of space, they'll naturally stay at a steady temperature, and – most importantly – think of all the untapped uranium ore down there! Talk about an economic boom! Sure, people might get a little depressed without the sun and there's always a slight risk of a cave in, but we'll send down shrinks, sun lamps and throw up a few extra buttresses to be safe."

[[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

5. "I have a much, much more palatable solution," assures your Minister of Internal Expansion, rubbing his hands together greedily. "Let's expand our coasts. How do we do that you ask? Simple, we reclaim it from the surrounding seas. All we need to do is build levees and dikes and pump out the water. It'll take some serious desalinization and a constant, reliable power source to accomplish, but it'll be worth it in the long run."

[b][anchor=343]#343[/anchor]: Brother, Can You Spare A Dime? [New Andram; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Since the minting of pennies is twice as costly as the coin's stated value, the idea of removing the smallest fractions of the @@CURRENCY@@ has been brought to your attention.

The Debate
1. "We are wasting MILLIONS of @@CURRENCY@@ on minting pennies!" raves an unusually passionate policy advocate, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while handing out 'Penny Dreadful' t-shirts to all your staff. "And all so people have to waste time scrambling through their purses and wallets just to dig out one hundredth of a @@CURRENCY@@. Many nations in @@REGION@@ have already abolished their most worthless coins. It's time for @@NAME@@ to follow suit." 

2. "That flies in the face of all our time-honored traditions," counters another advocate, this one bedecked in full period dress. "Our favorite national hero is portrayed on the storied one-cent coin, so it would be unpatriotic to discard the penny as worthless scrap. Especially since pennies lower prices slightly for the poorest of the poor. Very, very slightly." 

[3]. "Actually, I think it's high time we got rid of physical currency altogether," says the president of the Chamber of Commerce, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, flanked by officials from various security agencies. "We should just digitize all money. People spend more when they don't see themselves physically handing over cash, and the benefits to tracking terrorists and other subversives are obvious. That sounds like a solid win-win to me." [[color=blue]Must have computers[/color] AND [color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

[b][anchor=344]#344[/anchor]: Trash Talk [Luna Amore; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
After massive trash heaps overflowed onto one of @@CAPITAL@@'s busiest intersections, causing traffic to grind to a halt for ten hours, many have agreed that the nation's litter problem is out of control. In response, representatives from the Society for the Prettying Up of @@NAME@@ have come to your office proposing a nationwide beautification campaign to pick it all up.

The Debate
1. "Our wonderful country is being buried by this refuse!" wails SPU@@NAME_INITIALS@@ President @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It's simply a disgrace! We need funding and able-bodied men and women to stage a monthly clean-up of our once-treasured land. We'd pick up litter, plant trees, touch up the paint on the old courthouse – we'd polish up the whole country! As an incentive, participants could receive a small stipend."

[2]. "Now why on Earth should hard-working citizens do this?" asks the Warden of @@CAPITAL@@ Penitentiary, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We've got plenty of worthless criminals sitting around with their thumbs up their butts. Give these scum something worthwhile to do. They'll get to pay off their debt to society by helping clean it up!" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

*3. "It's not enough to just clean it up," asserts the CEO of Showers of Flowers. "We need a massive project to show @@REGION@@ how proud of our country we truly are. With a whole lot of government funds, my company could build the Hanging Gardens of @@CAPITAL@@. Picture it now: flowing vines down the walls, blooming daisies, baskets of chrysanthemums, thousands upon thousands of tourists. Think of the pride. Think of the money."

5. "Why are we wasting our time with this nonsense?" asks infamous miser @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "All this hullabaloo over a little trash. Here's a news flash: there's always going to be trash! A bunch of hippies prancing around on the government's dime ain't gonna change that! You should know better than to spend our tax @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ on such frivolous endeavors. Why don't you beautify our wallets instead and give us a tax break?"

[b][anchor=345]#345[/anchor]: Mayors Behaving Badly [Nation of Quebec; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
Many of @@NAME@@'s mayors have been getting into hot water in recent months; with allegations ranging from racist commentary to substance abuse, international media are having a field day on highlighting problems in @@NAME@@'s devolved governments. Concerned citizens are now wondering if higher levels of government should step in and take over city management.

The Debate
1. "Something has to be done," demands @@NAME@@ City Hall staffer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "@@NAME@@ City municipal hall is a mess with these constant scandals. The town has basically come to a standstill. It's clear that the national government needs to take over and weed out the corruption infesting the administration. This is having a real impact on our lives - there's a malfunctioning traffic light on my morning commute to work that's giving me hell for goodness sake!"

2. "The government can barely manage their own house and they want to take over mine?" scoffs @@NAME@@ City's controversial mayor on a local radio show. "I've run a fantastic city. I don't want to toot my own horn here but I'm the best mayor this city has ever had! These allegations are nothing more than media witch-hunts designed to take me down. Until such a time that these scurrilous accusations have been proven to be true, I say it's business as usual at city hall."

3. "What's the point of even having the rule of law if our politicians are just going to ignore it?" asks anti-corruption lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while going through your tax returns. "We need tougher laws and more judges with the gall to enforce them. Even the slightest infraction should result in the immediate dismissal of the mayor. It'll probably mean more elections, but it's worth it if it means that the citizenry continue to trust devolved government."

[b][anchor=346]#346[/anchor]: Oils Well That Ends Well [Jarethania; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
An offshore oil rig exploded spewing millions of barrels of petroleum into the South @@ANIMAL@@ Sea.

The Debate
1. "These oil companies must be held accountable for their reckless negligence!" yells environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while scrubbing the oil off a dolphin. "We cannot let this environmental catastrophe continue! We must stop the oil spewage and restore the environment to its former glory! And as for those greedy fat cats who caused this mess, they should foot the cleanup bill!"

2. "Woah, woah... let's not demonize the oil companies. It's not like they want these spills to happen," cautions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an investor in DrillBabyDrill Fund Management. "Think of what punitive measures would do to the economy. It's an unfortunate situation, to be sure, but do we really want to put one of @@NAME@@'s corporate stars out of business? That will only hurt us all. Let the government take care of the cleanup, like usual."

3. "Those are just short-term solutions," says solar engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ with a distant look in her eye. "We should do everything we can to stop this leak AND invest in alternative energy. Who needs limited fossil fuels when you have solar, wind, and geothermal power? Don't you want your children to live in a world free from the oily grasp of big business?"

4. "You're looking at this the wrong way. This isn't a problem; it's a golden opportunity!" says theme park tycoon, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, slicking back his hair as he continues, "Picture this: thousands upon thousands of tourists flocking to @@NAME@@. Why are these people coming in droves, you ask? To see the one, the only Great @@ANIMAL@@ Sea Oil Slick! Throw up a few more platforms, add some roller coasters, a few restaurants, tie it all together with a jolly mascot, and you've turned this unfortunate accident into a lucky break."

[b][anchor=347]#347[/anchor]: Crime Problems Ganging up on @@NAME@@ [The murtunian tribes; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
After a recent spate of drive-by shootings left dozens of bystanders dead, the public is demanding that the government do something to combat the alarming rise in gang-related violence.

The Debate
1. Shock jock @@RANDOM_NAME@@ is outraged - yet again - by the increase in crime. In today's broadcast he railed, "These gangs wage war on our streets, take the lives of innocent civilians, and smuggle contraband into our country! I say they're no different from terrorists and should be treated as such! Give the military a green light, and they'll wipe these thugs from the face of @@NAME@@. It's a drastic measure, but I think a martial curfew is worth it to protect our safety."

2. "Now now, there's no need to be so gung-ho about it," pontificates professor of sociology @@RANDOM_NAME@@ on a "@@CAPITAL@@ Morning!" interview from her luxurious downtown apartment. "Studies show that crime is directly related to poverty levels. These juveniles are just products of the dangerous environment they grow up in. I propose we increase funding to welfare and education to help get these young men off the streets so they can become productive members of society."

3. An unidentified man wearing a bandana around his face and pants twice his size confronts you as you leave the office for the evening. "We don't want you pigs in our hood, bruh." A dozen armed thugs materialize from the shadows. "Why don't you marks just keep out and let us handle our own beef?"

[b][anchor=348]#348[/anchor]: I Want A Lawyer [Marxist socialismchillville; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
A recent independent review into government expenditure has shown that, compared to other nations in @@REGION@@, @@NAME@@ spends very little on legal aid for impecunious suspects.

The Debate
1. "I ain't supposed to be in this joint!" @@RANDOM_NAME@@ whispers down a contraband phone. "Those loser courts went and decided I did this stupid thing and now I gotsa pay for it. I didn't do it yo! I tried to tell those fools that I was innocent, but the lawyer you hired to fork me over totally showed me up. I ain't got no @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to pay for a brief! Who'd you think I am, Hoprah Pinfry? Damn. You wanna make things right? Get e'rrybody 'ccused of a crime a 'spensive lawyer too. Maybe more innocent peoples won't get sent down."

2. "If you can't afford a lawyer, it's your own fault", lectures blue-collar worker @@RANDOM_NAME@@ on the evening news. "It's not my problem if they don't have the money or if they didn't go to law school. If you can't afford a lawyer, then don't break the law. Everything has consequences! Imagine the tax burden it would put on us hard-working individuals. Actually, instead of spending money on this ridiculous notion, I'd much prefer @@LEADER@@ to give us a tax break."

3. "Hmm. Now that's a good idea", says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your education advisor, with a gleam in his eye. "If everybody goes to law school then we won't need to pay for everyone to have a lawyer - they can represent themselves! We should make legal studies a core part of the curriculum, and give some incentives for people to do at least one year of law school. That way if you end up in court, you should be able to defend yourself with no problem at all."

The Issue
Following a bitter civil-conflict in Bigtopia that led to the overthrow of a dictatorial regime, leading officials from the deposed government are seeking refuge in @@NAME@@. The new Bigtopian government is accusing these people of war crimes, and has demanded their extradition.

The Debate
1. Your Minister for Foreign Affairs, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, echoes the pleas of the international community, "These individuals are responsible for decades of oppression, the genocide of millions of Bigtopians, and horrific war crimes - their leader isn't called 'The Butcher of Bigtopia' for his carving skills! We can't just step aside and neglect our duties to their victims. These men must face justice in Bigtopia, whatever their fate."

2. "I vehemently disagree," says defence lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, running a comb through his hair and handing you his business card. "Now is not the time for hasty action. Bigtopia is not a stable state yet - send these people back and you're throwing them to the mob. They've committed no crime in @@NAME@@, and they've come here for our help. Show some decency, and let them stay!"

3. "I have an idea," interjects Wernher von Grun from the Department of Defence. "Amongst these refugees are several top Bigtopian scientists. They may have carried out some terrible experiments with WMDs, but can we really afford to lose their expertise? Let them join our team at the Hexagon, and we'll develop weapons the envy of @@REGION@@. After all, once the missiles go up, who cares where they came from?"

The Issue
After @@NAME@@'s cuisine was rated dead last in a survey conducted by the world's best taste-testers, offended gastronomists have demanded a "national dish" to champion the country's food culture.

The Debate
1. "C'est terrible" bemoans Head Chef @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Saveloy Grande Hotel. "Too many youngsters are eating zis awful fast food. Ze government must encourage haute cuisine to demonstrate to ze world that @@NAME@@ is a country of beauty, love, and fine cooking. I suggest sautéed escargots avec garlic butter. Here - try one. Bon appétit!"

2. "What's wrong with fast food?" asks acned MaxiDonalds server @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as he scratches his nose. "Get a Maxi-sized triple cheeseburger and fries with soda for just five Units. Quick, cheap and tasty - that's why our customers love us. Next please!"

3. "Mornin'" calls out farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leading a cow into your office. "What do we care if some parboiled foreigners don't like our food? There's nothing better than good old-fashioned @@NAME@@-grown produce, cooked just the way me ol' ma would." Drawing a stun-gun and a cleaver from his dungarees, he continues, "Fancy a steak?"

4. "A good serving of sprouts is all I ever needed to grow up strong and healthy" says school dinner-lady @@RANDOM_NAME@@. Dolloping a mound of grey slop onto your plate, she continues, "Mashed cauliflower. The kids love it, and there's nothing better for growing the hair on your chest. Now eat it all up!"

5. A rancid stench precedes @@RANDOM_NAME@@ who slaps a foul-smelling plate of decayed @@NAME@@n Wolf liver diced with broiled asparagus and fermented pig's milk on your desk. "Some may call our customary food 'not with the times' or even 'nauseating', but what do they know? Show your love for @@NAME@@'s culinary heritage, and tuck in."

6. "There, there" soothes your PA @@RANDOM_NAME@@, proffering a bucket. "Our cuisine could use work, but there's so many dishes we'd have to fix… Oh, I know! You can't go wrong with pasta. Why not have everyone eat pasta? Only pasta." A plate of linguine appears on your desk.

The Issue
After a highly publicized arrest, in which one of the nation's wealthiest celebrities was detained for assaulting two of her servants with a priceless Fabergé egg, some of @@NAME@@'s rich have begun demanding the right to avoid prison terms by paying off their victims.

The Debate
1. "It makes, like, no sense for someone like ME to be stuck here for three WHOLE DAYS," whines Clarrisse Milton during a jail cell interview, only after dimming the lights and getting earplugs for her hangover. "And the trial hasn't even STARTED. My daddy has PLENTY of money and, like, nothing better to spend it on. He could just give a few million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to the victims' families and, um... like, the government. That's fair, right?"

2. "You've got to be kidding me!" bellows @@NAME@@'s Attorney General, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, angrily pounding his fist on your desk. "No one should be above the law, no matter how much money they have! It's bad enough that they can hire some shyster lawyer to get them off on a technicality most of the time. As a matter of fact, we should make the rich use public defenders. It's only fair considering everyone else is stuck with them. You know what, just expand the entire public defenders' office while you're at it."

3. "Instead of wasting money on prisons for violent criminals, I could take care of your problem," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@NAME@@'s wealthiest psychopath, while polishing a rifle. "I'm an unrivaled hunter, but with animals there's no challenge for an expert such as myself. If you sent prey to my island estate, I'd be willing to throw a few electrons the government's way. You save money; I take care of the scum in your penal system. Sounds like a win-win to me."

The Issue
With suicide-by-train incidents in @@NAME@@'s stations becoming increasingly common, commuters and rail companies are growing irritated by the impact that this has had on their day-to-day activities.

The Debate
*1. "We need to be compensated for the monetary losses that these suicides have caused us", the CEO of your nation's largest rail company states frankly. "These incidents are inconvenient, and handling them requires a lot of time and effort; and time is, of course, money. It's not right that these people get away with disrupting our business, as well as our customers' commutes. I humbly suggest that their families should be required to compensate us on their behalf.

*2. "Someone must be blamed for the loss of industrial efficiency that these suicides have caused us," the Director of the State Railways comments frankly.

It's not right that these people get away with disrupting state productivity, as well as the travel arrangements of our toiling workers. I humbly suggest that their families should be held accountable, and arrested. It's only fair." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

3. "I have places to go and things to do", an angry commuter vents in an interview with @@CAPITAL@@ News, which is playing on your office's television. "These lunatics keep forcing train delays, and that means that I can't get to work on time. My boss is absolutely irate! Look, the government should stick cowcatchers on the trains, then the body parts can just be pushed out of the way. No more delays."

4. "People who try to kill themselves shouldn't be punished for being ill, and neither should the families of victims of suicide", your Minister of Health, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, entreats passionately. "Being suicidal is often a sign of mental illness or depression, and our government mustn't stoop to punishing families for having sick relatives. We ought to focus on suicide prevention rather than hounding these families for money, and we would save a lot of lives through education and extending a helping hand to those who need our support."

5. "I'm getting tired of seeing yellow tape every time I go to take the train in the morning. The atmosphere in stations is getting grimmer by the day", your receptionist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, comments absent-mindedly while handing you some coffee. "I think that you could hit two birds with one stone here if you redecorated the train stations. Suicidal people would be far less likely to take the terrible leap if the stations had pleasant music playing, motivational posters, and psychedelic paint jobs all over their walls. Oh, and maybe some pizza joints in the station too! Everyone loves pizza."

The Issue
An IT firm organized an unusual race between a carrier pigeon toting a flash drive and @@NAME@@'s fastest internet provider. The bird easily beat the internet, prompting a debate about internet speeds.

The Debate
1. "This is horribly embarrassing!" cries the pixelated image of popular online vlogger @@RANDOM_NAME@@. Two and a half minutes of buffering later she continues, "Our internet is the slowest in @@REGION@@. Our system needs a massive overhaul. We need to crank it up! Fiber optic connections all across @@NAME@@! Imagine the increase in productivity. Imagine how much more connected we'll all be. It'll be well worth the cost, @@LEADER@@."

2. "You've got to be joking!" scoffs your Minister of Finance, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The government have far more important problems at hand than dealing with trivial matters such as the internet speed. The people of @@NAME@@ have access to the internet. That's far better than most of the world. Leave the internet providers to run themselves and get back to the business of running the country."

3. "Well, this certainly is eye-opening," exclaims amateur birdwatcher, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, with a pair of binoculars dangling from his neck. "Here we are mucking about with our inefficient technology and the birds have us beat! Clearly we need to convert all our inefficient internet into bird-based-broadband!

[b][anchor=354]#354[/anchor]: Subversive Shortwaves [The Grand Dilligaf; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Radio Free @@NAME@@ - operating out of neighboring Bigtopia - has been broadcasting subversive views throughout @@NAME@@. Government hard-liners, outraged by the station's ideology, have demanded that something now be done.

The Debate
1. "This cannot stand!" barks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the Armed Forces. "Bigtopia has always tried to undermine us, and allowing known rabble-rousers to broadcast their vile propaganda into our nation is just their latest attempt to destabilize our government. Immediate invasion and a blank check for the military would silence this Bigtopian nonsense once and for all."

2. "Excessive and far too expensive," counters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a professor at the @@NAME@@ Institute of Communications Engineering. "The solution is not always bombing or occupation. After all, our main targets are their radio stations. A powerful transmitter to jam the frequencies they broadcast on will prevent anyone from listening. It just so happens I have the blueprints for such a device with me. Sure, it won't be cheap, but it will cost far less than a prolonged military campaign."

3. "I think my esteemed colleagues are putting the cart before the horse," says a shifty character from Overseas Intelligence. "It would be much more effective if there were no dissidents willing to broadcast in the first place. My people are in place; just give the word and we can silence this station within a week. Along with every other unpatriotic muckraker we can track down, of course."

4. "I can't believe what I'm hearing," gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a social policy adviser. "Dissent is an essential part of the political process. How are we to know what we are doing wrong if we don't listen to our critics? Sure some of them have extreme opinions, but it's our responsibility to build bridges and understand why they feel so disenfranchised that they felt they had to leave in the first place. I suggest initiating a government-funded study to identify the root of the problem, followed by training for all government employees to ensure none of our population feels this way again."

But there is a solution: back in their native Maxtopia, these pests are kept in check by the Sabre-toothed @@ANIMAL@@. We have to introduce these animals into our forests before it's too late. And you know, since I'm such a nice guy, I'll cut you a deal on the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@."

2. "You can't stop one invasive species by introducing another," scoffs avid hunter @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while skinning several rabbits on your desk. "Just give out hunting permits for these Spikeballs, and we'll have the population under control in no time. You know what, might as well extend hunting and fishing seasons for other animals too. I've been itching to bag myself a Giant Lilliputian Rabbit." 

[3]. "We shouldn't be left at the mercy of our citizens," counsels gendarme @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while barely suppressing his hatred for animals. "If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself. Let's send out our boys in blue to go hunt down these vermin." Frothing rabidly, he finishes, "That way we can be sure every last one of those mangy, stinking, filth-ridden pests is dead!" [[color=purple]Must have a police force[/color]]

4. "So what if these Spikeballs are eating all the trees?" says thoroughly apathetic citizen @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Nature got along fine for millions of years before we came into the picture. Just let survival of the fittest run its course. Sure, we might lose a few species or ecosystems along the way, but at least we'll save some money. Forests are really boring, anyway."

[b][anchor=356]#356[/anchor]: @@NAME@@ In The Time Of Cholera [Wonnie; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Reports of cholera deaths have skyrocketed due to the sewage contaminating @@NAME@@'s rivers.

The Debate
1. "People are dropping like flies out here!" cries Doctor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose disheveled appearance suggests that the flies are actually doing quite well. "This is all the fault of the corrupt, uncaring sewage companies that dump waste into our rivers. We need to enforce harsher environmental regulations and make them pay to clean up the mess they created!"

2. "We don't pump our water from the sea," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, night shift manager at @@NAME@@ Water & Utility. "Why not just put our waste on barges and dump it far out in international waters? We at @@NAME_INITIALS@@W&U will be pumping nice clean water again, and the waste will never be a problem for anyone but foreigners, so it's win-win."

[b][anchor=357]#357[/anchor]: Vamos, Mi @@ANIMAL@@! [Octuagesimo Octavo; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
Following the ban on cars, a criminal alliance dominated by Olympic-class sprinters has sprung up, resulting in hundreds of running footwear shops being robbed. @@NAME@@ 's police force has requested that they be allowed to ride @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ as a substitute for their inability to chase these athletic thugs on foot.

The Debate
1. "It's brilliant, if you ask me," says portly Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while enjoying a doughnut break. "Chasing criminals on foot is so tiresome now that we can't have our cars. If the government allowed Mounties, the entire process would be so much easier. We wouldn't even need to put handcuffs on suspects, since we'd just trample 'em down!" 

2. "It's a good idea, but we can solve this using a much more direct approach," muses a tanned off-duty cop. "I mean, why bother with animals when you can still allow cars? I agree cars should be banned for the public, but we policemen need them. Besides, it's MUCH more fun to run over criminals with cars than @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@." 

3. "You wimps are a disgrace!" bellows lycra-clad gym instructor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You don't need cars or @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ to keep up. It's about time someone whipped the lot of you into shape. Give me four hours a day with these pansies and I'll have them catching criminals in no time at all. Now drop and give me twenty!"

[b][anchor=358]#358[/anchor]: Not Another Teen Pregnancy [Valrifell; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
An investigation into a string of under-aged pregnancies in @@CAPITAL@@ has uncovered a new trend where babies are lauded as the latest 'must-have accessory' for teenage girls. Parents across @@NAME@@ are demanding that the government intervene to put a stop to this emerging fad.

The Debate
1. "Children shouldn't be having children", wails @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a self-described concerned mother, who also happens to be President of the @@CAPITAL@@ Chapter of Concerned @@DENONYM@@ Mothers. "Babies! That's all they are - babies! It's all this government's fault for having such a liberal age of consent. It's encouraging our babies to have sex! It's just terrifying. Please, increase the age of consent. You know in your heart that it's the right thing to do."

*2. "If anything, those Concerned Mothers are the problem!" exclaims your Labor Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I mean, really, the youngsters of today are proving themselves to be excellent parents and quite capable of living with the consequences. @@NAME@@ desperately needs a new generation of @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ to ensure a steady stream of future workers, so we need to encourage young people to have more children. We should actually decrease the age of consent so even more youth can start families, and of course that means the state should support these new parents with childcare and a small tax credit." [[color=blue]Must not have compulsory military service[/color]]

*3. "If anything, those Concerned Mothers are the problem!" exclaims your Defense Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I mean, really, the youngsters of today are proving themselves to be excellent parents and quite capable of living with the consequences. We must increase the national birth rate, or else our conscription numbers will be insufficient for future wars. We should actually decrease the age of consent so even more youth can start families, and of course that means the army should support these new parents with military schools and boot camps to bring up the nation's future soldiers." [[color=red]Must have compulsory military service[/color]]

*4. "I have a better idea", says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of 'Children 4 U' Inc. "How about we ban all forms of sexual conduct and have all newborns neutered? I know it's radical, but people will calm down once they learn that we can create their perfect child. This is the way of the future - Design Your Own Baby! And if the government gets involved, think of the money you'll make back off it. That's a great deal @@LEADER@@, trust me." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*5. "I have a better idea," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a bitter and perpetually single minister. "How about we ban all forms of sexual conduct and have all newborns neutered? I know it's radical, but people will calm down once they learn that we can create their perfect child. This is the way of the future - Design Your Own Citizens! The government can create a compliant population of Communist workers, rather than selfish capitalists and young women who always want to date rich businessmen rather than hard working ministers. Anyway... that's a great deal @@LEADER@@, trust me." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

[6]. "I think sterilizing the population is a little extreme", your civil service's Chief Medical Officer states candidly. "But we do need to stop these teenage pregnancies, so let's prioritize sex education and free contraceptives. These are teenagers; their hormones are all over the place, and regardless of what we preach about abstinence, they're going to have sex. And for those that get pregnant anyways, free abortion should be available on demand." [[color=blue]Abortion is legal[/color]]

[b][anchor=359]#359[/anchor]: Got Democracy? [Nation of Quebec; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
As waves of pro-democracy protests continue in @@REGION@@, with several actually toppling long-standing regimes, your advisers fear the protests could soon hit @@NAME@@. An emergency conference has been called to discuss the looming crisis.

The Debate
1. "We must crack down hard on all rebels who dare to betray our beloved nation!" roars @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the @@NAME@@ State Police. "We must use whatever force is necessary to prevent these protests from happening here. Specifically that means roving death squads and informants monitoring all anti-government activity to shut them down before they revolt. So long as @@LEADER@@ is our ruler, treason shall never go unpunished!"

2. "Atrocities would only give these protesters more motivation to rebel," quickly counters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Propaganda Minister, while reading through socioeconomic figures. "Some of their complaints are worth looking into, if you don't want the wolves at the gates. Establish large-scale public works projects to lower unemployment and things will be back to normal in no time. We could hire people to build schools and health clinics and repair utilities. These protesters say they want a revolution, but I think you'll find they'll settle for a lot less."

3. "The people are angry and fed up with the system. If you want to stop the protests, you must give them exactly what they want!" dramatically declares a protester who somehow smuggled herself in through a food cart. "The time for real democracy is now!" Between screams of pain, as your bodyguards tackle her to the floor, she finishes, "By any means necessary!"

4. "After disposing of the trespasser, the meeting resumes. "We can't allow TRUE democracy. Do you really think that the people would pick a suitable replacement for you?" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your most loyal bodyguard, while sharpening a halberd. "For all we know they'll elect some anarchist with an ax to grind! How about we let them vote, but we only permit reputable Party members to run? That gives the people the right to decide small matters, while making sure that critical issues are left to our Party veterans."

5. "I have an unorthodox way to solve this once and for all," suggests your questionably sane Interior Minister, playing with a chemistry set despite the gravity of the meeting. "Instead of all that 'populism,' why don't we infuse the water supply with, I dunno, sedatives or something?" He grins maniacally. "Imagine how easy it would be to control the citizenry! Put the right drugs in the water, and I'm sure you'd have zero dissidents. Think about it: you could abolish all those superfluous legislatures and make yourself @@NAME@@'s absolute ruler."
