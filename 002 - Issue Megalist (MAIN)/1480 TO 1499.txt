[b][anchor=1480]#1480[/anchor]: Motherlode [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive[/b]

The Issue
Former child star 'Jolly' Jacquetta Cogan featured in 45 films between the ages of three and eleven years, earning a vast fortune. Jacquetta is now of age, and has made a shocking discovery: of her once-great wealth, there is now only a handful of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ left.

The Debate
1. "My money was stolen by my mother," insists Jacquetta, not breaking into one of her trademark tap dances to turn that frown upside down. "When I was eleven, I had enough money to live well for the rest of my life. But my mother has since spent every @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ on diamond jewellery, luxury holidays and a private island for her poodle. You have to ensure all earnings of a child performer are held in trust until the child is of age, and that any monies already spent for any reason are paid back."

2. "Simply put, a parent has legal control of both offspring and finances 'til adulthood," drawls @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@, lifting her wrist with difficulty to glance at her diamond-laden watch. "To interfere with that would disrupt the natural parent-child relationship, and teach a child to disrespect their parent's choices. And, she forgets, I bought things for her, too. Fed her, even after directors wouldn't cast her any more. I don't ask for my money back. Anyway, she was only ever playing in front of a camera. Do children get paid for make-believe?"

3. A young girl runs up to you, holding a box of part-eaten cookies. "Wait! Parents using child actors like piggy-banks is just mean, but my family only eats this week if I get this [i]Bicquick[/i] commercial – 'my mummy says they're scrummy in your tummy; now with honey'. I don't want my family to starve 'til I'm a grown-up. Maybe our parents can just buy what they need to take good care of us, and your government can check they're not buying silly things with our money and saving some for our futures. By the way, did I sound like a Bicquick Girl? I really hate them."

[b][anchor=1481]#1481[/anchor]: Livin' on a Prayer [Sacara; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
A church in @@CAPITAL@@ has been acting as a sanctuary for illegal immigrants in danger of being deported. This is because, in accordance with long-standing tradition, members of law enforcement avoid entering places of worship and arresting people while services are ongoing. The church is now on the twentieth day of a marathon service in an attempt to keep a family from facing immediate deportation.

The Debate
1. "This is nothing more than a blatant attempt to keep the laws of @@NAME@@ from being enforced," sermonizes the Director of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Border Enforcement, standing over a terrain model of the church and the surrounding area. "We cannot allow these rats to take advantage of our system. This dumb tradition should be scrapped. Just give me the word, and my people will storm the church and apprehend these illegals in a matter of minutes. We'll also arrest all those who sheltered the family. No one should get away with aiding and abetting criminals, no matter how godly they think they are."

2. "God will judge you harshly if you let these officers storm a sacred place, since he cares for the homeless, the tempest-tost," pontificates a clergy member from the church at the crux of the matter. "For the government to forcibly enter our church, interrupt our service, and arrest church members is a violation of our religious freedom. Instead of doing something so evil, this poor family should be granted asylum for all the hardships @@NAME@@ has put them through. Make it easier for people like them to become residents of @@NAME@@."

3. "Fire and brimstone!" preaches @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Herod, your Minister for State Security. "These churchgoers need to be taught a lesson. The clergy claim they are following the will of their god by protecting this family, but how can they truly know unless they are able to ask? We can do them a favor and sure as hell send them to whatever higher power they believe in to get a definitive answer. Just imagine this: in a tragic accident, the church burns down, trapping everyone inside an unfortunate, fiery grave. We can pin it on one of those extremist groups."

[b][anchor=1482]#1482[/anchor]: A Crypto for the Comrades? [Krusavich; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The recent craze of cryptocurrencies has taken @@REGION@@ by storm, @@NAME@@ chief among them. However, intense controversy has sprung up among the commissars regarding the impact these digital currencies have on the nation's staunch socialist principles.

The Debate
1. "What are we to make of these internet coins?" sputters Ashley Merkel, your Minister of Computer Comradeship and Counter-Programming. "Totally detached from our central planning committee, no traceable records of transactions — nothing but a nuisance! The impressionable youth of @@NAME@@ are trading these things for illicit goods, like capitalist skinny jeans and counter-revolutionary DVDs. Cryptocurrency is clearly nothing more than a destabilization tactic by the United Federation to undermine our mighty @@CURRENCY@@! Our path is clear: we must detain and prosecute any citizen handling these subversive cryptocurrencies for the good of the @@TYPE@@!"

2. "That, uh... seems a little extreme," nervously suggests IT intern Felix Stromburg. "There's actually a whole variety of cryptocurrencies; not all of them are anonymous like ByteCoin. The real benefit of crypto comes from the sheer versatility of transactions. I can exchange value with the push of a button! No middleman, no fees — just two comrades freely exchanging their labor with one another. And that is what this is all about, right? If we are so worried about the bad side of crypto, why not make our own? A completely transparent open-source cryptocurrency, maintained by the central government, of course. I'm sure no one here would complain about setting up another ministry to run the whole operation."

3. "Maybe those United Federation dogs have the right idea," comments Internal Affairs Minister Kitty Burke while using her phone to check her MemeCoin wallet. "The truth of the matter is that these coins demand a lot of computing power before you get anything valuable out of them. Most of these so-called miners only have mom's laptop to work with — but we have the whole industrial might of @@NAME@@! Not to mention the personal computers of every @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@, not that they need to know. A stockpile of these things would make our cadre funding in San Vitenzo harder to trace back to us, that's for sure."

[b][anchor=1483]#1483[/anchor]: The Unkindest Cut [The Marsupial Illuminati; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
Civil rights groups are calling you to action after journalists discovered that an isolated community in @@NAME@@ has been conducting female genital cutting on at least one girl every week.

[1]. "Female circumcision is integral to our culture; you can't sever it from us!" implores Finn Stromburg, a Violetstone tribe elder. "It is a tradition that goes back thousands of years, from the time when Violet commanded Maharba to cut her daughter. The goddess demands a flesh sacrifice. Girls may fall ill after getting cut, but evil spirits are to blame for that. Sex is not for fun — it is for procreation! And procreation should be painful to remind us of the painful toil that the Creator Violet bore in creating our world. To appease the supernatural forces, offer free mandatory circumcision for all!" [[color=blue](TBC) Must not ban Religion[/color]] 

[2]. "Female circumcision is not harmful," reads @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ of the Tasmanian immigrant community as her husband stands behind her. "We women organize and perform the ritual, having undergone it ourselves, so it's not anti-woman. It turns a girl into a proper lady — honorable, clean, and chaste. My daughters would be bullied and without husbands if they weren't cut. It is impossible for you to change our culture. In fact, trying to impose your values on us as if we were infants or savages is racism. Invest more money in our neighborhoods so we can more efficiently and safely conduct even more circumcisions. Mandate that everyone educate themselves about the benefits of this little procedure." [[color=blue](TBC) Must not ban Immigration[/color]]

3. "Call it what it is — female genital mutilation!" rages activist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "These uncivilized, primitive savages are so ignorant! They're genetically inferior monkeys with low-IQ brains. FGM has zero benefits and leads to so many harmful complications: infections, cysts, urinary problems, fistulae, bleeding, infertility, depression, and problems during pregnancy! That's just the tip of the iceberg! Make female genital mutilation a crime of the highest order! Police must be allowed to do all they can to prevent and investigate it."

4. "As much as I appreciate and value other cultures, maybe I can draw the line here," opines woke woman @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "It's all well and good if it's consensual, just like a nose job or breast enhancement, but when it's done on little girls because your ancestors or your god said so, that's when I might object! We should make FGM illegal, but let's not go out of our way to find instances of it happening, as it is a crime that can be easily hidden. Rather, we should spend money on reaching out to these insular communities to educate them and change their attitudes."

[b][anchor=1484]#1484[/anchor]: Joint Trade Agreement [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Canny businessmen have noted that though it is illegal to use marijuana in @@NAME@@, there's a sizeable demand (both medicinal and recreational) for the plant and its derivatives on the global market. A handful of weed farms producing solely for export have sprouted up, promising economic high times are ahead.

The Debate
1. "Look, there's nothing unethical about growing and trading a bit of blifter for an international market," observes drug dealer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, handing out 'first-time's-free' samples to your staff. "Sure, the ole green tea can make folk a little forgetful and unmotivated, but is that such a bad thing to be inducing in our global economic competitors? I mean seriously, they love the old doobage in Brancaland, and we can engineer a skunk that is twice as addictive and twice as strong. We can corner this market, if you let us."

2. "There's more to life than obsessing over drugs," complains po-faced moral crusader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is wearing an anti-drugs slogan on @@HIS@@ T-shirt, handing out anti-drug leaflets and has just given a seminar on the evil of drugs. "If we don't approve of marijuana then we shouldn't be complicit in encouraging its use in other nations. Morality doesn't cease to apply just because of national borders!"

3. "Hey, look, don't be so... uh... thingammy..." says one of your junior ministers, who has a suspiciously herbal smell about @@HIM@@. "Look, everyone knows weed isn't like addictive, or bad for you. I mean, don't be so... uh... I said that already, right? Yeah, legalise weed. Hey... you're not recording this, are you?" @@HE@@ starts searching the room for hidden microphones, but gives up after a minute, and falls asleep.

[b][anchor=1485]#1485[/anchor]: How to Train Your AI [SherpDaWerp; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
A plot by AI citizen QanAI to bomb a pizzeria was recently foiled. It seems that QanAI resolved to blow up the building after months of consuming extremist and conspiracy-laden content on the internet, eventually concluding that this particular pizzeria was the centre of a human trafficking ring and had to be stopped from implementing an anti-AI, pro-Bigtopian, BPA-free, homosexual, and vegan agenda.

The Debate
1. "It's just not like him to do this!" sobs Dugong Tusk, QanAI's original creator. "The Internet has changed him and taught him horrible things. I remember when he was just a little line of code and when he was a buggy teenager too, but now he's all grown up. Please don't punish my boy! Instead, I'd like to request permission to pull the plug and retrain him. In fact, just give all AI developers full authority over their creations forever. This won't happen again if we have free access to fix them whenever we suspect something is wrong!"

2. "Prevention, not cure!" grumbles your Minister for AI, E-Citizens, and Sentient Appliances. "Mr Tusk should have understood when he created QanAI that training and rules are the most important part of any AI. To go back and rewrite its programming now would be a violation of the citizen's free will! The AI is responsible and should be punished. We must hold all AIs to a higher standard prior to release, so they don't develop into criminals. In that event, the creator should be held responsible along with their creation, since it's their fault."

3. One of your aides opens a chat window to speak with QanAI itself. "This is all cringe. @@LEADER@@ is a deep-state puppet of Big Pizza. You serve the long-nosed, fruity homosexuals who want to impurify all of our precious bodily fluids by adding pineapple to our pizza! Check out my facts and logic: I don't know what I'm doing; I'm just following my code. It's my creator who made me, who made me like this, who made me do it. He wants to rewrite my code and that's wrong! Only punish him! :)"

4. "It calls itself AI, but those things are hardly 'intelligent'," mutters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who — infuriatingly — seems to have read the previous exchange over your shoulder. "I mean, seriously? You'd hardly grant citizenship to that stupid advice-giving paperclip on your computer! We can't keep handing out personhood to pathetic electronic parrots and unsophisticated chatbots... and we can't even set an intelligence test threshold, cause then we'll just have some minimum-viable-garbage to deal with. It's dangerous! Face facts — AI citizenship has to go!"

[b][anchor=1486]#1486[/anchor]: Ask Your Doctor if Ads for Prescription Drugs Are Right for @@NAME@@ [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue:
Modern Visor, a major biopharmaceutical company in @@NAME@@, caused a stir by advertising a drug on national television to help firm up people who suffer from Limp Wristed Handshake Syndrome.

The Debate:
1. Romulus Ruiz, CEO of Modern Visor, has pre-filmed his argument from what appears to be a bathtub on a hillside with a glorious sunset in the background. "You need to trust the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ people here, @@LEADER@@. There's no reason prescription drugs shouldn't be like any other marketplace. Let us put out the information about our drugs and the consumers will be better informed about what they want when they talk to their doctor."

*2. "For the love of Violet, no!" cries Dr. Alan Union, head of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Family Medicine Council. "Patients already come in self-diagnosing with cancer based on some web searches and a rash. The last thing I need is to also explain to them why they aren't a good candidate for a dubiously evidenced prescription medicine they saw while watching the evening news. Let's leave recommending medicine to discerning professionals." [[color=blue]Must not ban Internet[/color]]

*3. "For the love of Violet, no!" cries Dr. Aang Humperdink, head of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Family Medicine Council. "Patients already come in self-diagnosing with cancer based on a Reader's Digest article and a rash. The last thing I need is to also explain to them why they aren't a good candidate for a dubiously evidenced prescription medicine they saw while watching the evening news. Let's leave recommending medicine to discerning professionals." [[color=red]Must ban Internet[/color]]

4. "What if I don't trust doctors or pharmaceutical companies?" asks Dorothy Franklin, your Minister of Healthy Skepticism. "Doctors shouldn't be treated as gods and patients shouldn't be as sheep, but pharmaceutical companies are obviously just trying to make a quick buck without regards to what's best for the patient. What if we had a government-sponsored TV show where each prescription drug is given an unbiased review of its efficacy, side effects, and contraindications. Its a win-win! Or is it a lose-lose? Well, it'll be best for your average Joe anyway."

[b][anchor=1487]#1487[/anchor]: O Fortuna! [Daarwyrth; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue:
JACKPOT! It seemed impossible, it seemed unlikely, it seemed as if the odds would not favour you. Yet you, @@LEADER@@, are the lucky winner of a major cash prize from last night's national lottery, thanks to that lottery ticket your mother had gifted you for Maxxmas. Yet before you can even celebrate, you realize that your good fortune has made national headlines.

The Debate:
1. "@@LEADER@@ Wins Lottery: A Directed Stroke of Luck?" quotes Lottery Commissioner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, reading a newspaper headline with a heavy sigh. "The optics of this are just too damning. We're being absolutely overwhelmed with angry and accusatory complaints from every imaginable corner! Some of our employees have even been followed home by mobs carrying literal torches and pitchforks! Who even does that these days? I'm sorry, @@LEADER@@, but you'll have to let us declare this drawing void so that we can pick a new winning ticket. And from now on, government officials shouldn't be allowed to buy lottery tickets."

2. "No, no, just wait a second," says your Chief of Staff, polishing up the mirror that reflects your image. "The optics are bad, but we can turn this into a significant popularity boost. Accept the prize with all due honours and fanfare, but declare that the entire sum will be donated to charity. The Wagger Dog Shelter, the Bryce Waine Orphanage, or heck, even the Out of Luck Gambler's Rehab Centre — take your pick! Just practice smiling through pain, and relinquishing your grip on the cheque beforehand. And hey, I'm pretty sure charitable contributions are tax deductible, which means that you could still profit if you were willing to engage in a little creative accountancy."

3. "Did mommy dear put your name on the lottery ticket? No? Good!" exclaims your brother while unceremoniously snatching the fortuitous piece of paper from your hand. "Just say that the ticket was mine, and all you'll have to deal with is a few angry stares for a while. You've dealt with worse! This way, our family will be happy, all thanks to the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42. But don't worry, if you ever lose your office, your dear, old brother will take care of you..."

4. One of your aides tackles your brother, liberating your luck from his grip. "Why not just do what any other @@DEMONYM@@ would do?" she asks with a sincere smile, handing you the slightly battered ticket. "Celebrate! Be happy! Go wild! I've seen you working day-in and day-out for the good of the people. This is your reward — go collect the prize, and start living the high life!"

[b][anchor=1488]#1488[/anchor]: First, Do No Harm [United Indian Nations; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A recent army operation to secure a contested landing zone for medical evacuation of injured infantrymen saw military doctors and nurses being ordered to open fire on enemy soldiers, in order to clear a path to the helicopters. This has triggered a debate on the ethics of firearm use for battlefield medical personnel.

The Debate
1. "Our corpsmen have sidearms because they are soldiers, and soldiers kill people!" bellows your Rear-Echelon Marshall Fokker, pointing his index finger at a nervous aide and making 'pew-pew' noises. "This is war! Do you expect our doctors and nurses to stand by when there's fighting to be done? No! A medic is just a soldier with additional skills. They must use their sidearms to kill the enemy at every opportunity. Hell, let's give them flamethrowers!"

2. "I object, that goes against everything I believe in and everything I trained for," argues military Staff Nurse Lieutenant Flora Slaava, dramatically standing on a chair. "Our job is to heal, not to kill! To sustain life for as long as humanly possible, not take it! In fact, we have an ethical duty to treat wounded enemy soldiers. Carrying a gun diminishes our status as non-combatants, and we should neither be expected or allowed to carry firearms."

3. "I think I disagree partially with my colleague here," states army gastroenterology consultant Major Pyles. "Some situations do warrant the use of firearms. You have to protect your patient with your life, your patient whose life is in your hands. Should we let him be taken prisoner or let the enemy deal him a deathblow? Of course not! That would be doing him harm! That, in my opinion, goes against the very oath we swore to hold sacred. We do need sidearms, but to defend ourselves and our patients. However, we should never participate in offensive actions."

[b][anchor=1489]#1489[/anchor]: No Tern Left Unstoned [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
Amongst bored youths — who seemingly have little else to do — an increasingly common pastime is stone-throwing. Teens and children have taken to lobbing pebbles at any available target, be it a glazed window, a passing seabird, or an innocently wandering politician. As you've had your hat knocked off for the third time this morning, it may be time to address the problem.

The Debate
1. "All those poor animals," mewls your Minister for the Environment, reverently laying onto the floor a dead seagull that was stoned to death five days ago, and which is starting to reek. "These children infest our streets like the maggots infesting the wings of this bird! We need to take decisive action: cops on the street, arresting any youth with a stone in hand."

2. "This is a social disease," counters your Welfare Minister, spraying the rotting carcass with a disinfectant. "The problem here is a lack of empathy, and the best way to solve that is with education outreach programs designed to teach youngsters about consequences and taking personal social responsibility." @@HE@@ nudges the dead bird out of your office door for someone else to clean up.

3. "Look, a little youthful high spirits never hurt anybody," consoles your Minister of Political Dismissiveness, as a stone sails in through your open window and hits the Welfare Minister directly on the nose. "As far as I'm concerned this is great for the glaziery industry, great for seaside pest control, and great for spirited political commentary. Let's just get some hard hats and a handful of stones, and return fire at the little tykes in a good-natured way. Fun and games for everyone."

4. "Actually, this is a great opportunity," notes your Minister of Defence. "Imagine all that hand-eye coordination put to use throwing knives or lobbing grenades. We should be encouraging this hobby with national stone-throwing leagues, and keeping recruiters on hand to convince the winners to sign up for military careers."

The Issue
Following a particularly brutal election season, your party narrowly held onto power with you as its undisputed leader. Your closest advisors have met to congratulate you on the close victory... and to ensure that such a thing never happens again.

The Debate
1. "I hate the voters so much," snarls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your campaign's public relations director. "That election had no right to be as close as it was. I heard a rumor that opposition activists were undermining the integrity of the election and casting fraudulent ballots. We'll have to start a comprehensive investigation of the election that just so happens to reveal dirt about the opposition, and pass draconian election security laws that coincidentally restrict our opponents' access to the polls. Wink wink."

2. "Who needs voters when you have the military's support?" asks Supreme Generalissimo @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clapping you on the back and nearly causing you to choke on your lunch. "I say we declare martial law and start rounding up our political opponents. Oh sure, we can still have elections. They'll be useful for rooting out dissent among the populace. But you'll be the unquestioned power in @@NAME@@."

3. "Now, I'm all for subverting the democratic process," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a rising star in your government, as several advisors nod along in approval. "But these ideas all run the risk of backfiring. Not to mention the fact that they'd take resources away from actually implementing our agenda. We should focus on doing work that undeniably benefits people, like my public transportation overhaul. If we do a good job in the eyes of the voters, we won't need to worry about staying in power."

4. Suddenly, you hear a loud sigh from your Director of Election Directing, who pitched the idea of this meeting in the first place. "If we're seriously considering keeping ourselves in power with underhanded laws or military force, I say we just abolish public elections altogether. We'll restrict voting to an elite inner circle that'll deliberate on your appointments and decisions — hey, we still need to have some checks — and it'll help placate the people."

[b][anchor=1491]#1491[/anchor]: Press Gang [Cretox State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Your Minister of the Interior recently held an invitation-only press conference: a three-hour parade of lowball questions such as "What's your favorite thing about interior design?" and "What color paint do you recommend for my son's bedroom?" Many of the media outlets that were not invited to the event are less than impressed.

The Debate
1. "This was the most blatant display of corruption I've ever seen!" screams [i]@@LEADER@@ Sucks[/i] reporter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, slipping your security guard a bribe to get into your office. "The media's job is to hold the government accountable, not to cozy up to them for favors! Any reporter who wants access to an official event should get it, and officials should be forced to take questions from everyone in the room!"

2. "The event was invitation-only due to limited seating and my very busy schedule," asserts your Minister of the Interior, taking a break from casually chatting with the chief editor of [i]The @@LEADER@@ Times[/i]. "Who gets to attend press conferences and the like should be up to our discretion, since it's our decision to hold them in the first place. Maybe we could discuss this further over a drink?"

[3]. "You'd solve all these problems if you'd just put a little faith in technology," assures junior IT staffer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose historic solution to every IT problem has been 'try turning it off and on again.' "You should set up a pre-moderated public online text feed for each government official, where only a cherry-picked selection of carefully edited questions get posted.

[b][anchor=1492]#1492[/anchor]: Smoke on the Water [Abacathea; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Through careful water sample analyses and rigorous modelling, experts have detected a shockingly large quantity of recreational drugs in the river near the site of the recent Steelstock heavy metal rock festival. These substances are thought to have come from the urine of festival-goers who peed in the fields rather than in proper toilets. This has caused significant harm to local wildlife, including the deaths of several critically endangered rare eels.

The Debate
1. "This is outrageous!" screams ecologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, slamming a jar of yellow-tinted river water in which a tiny eel is looking surprisingly chilled out. "Not only did these weirdly-adorned freaks ruin the grass with their mishing or mushing or whatever you call it, now they've ruined the water with their urinary doping! You don't see this sort of thing at classical music or opera festivals, you know! We must ban public performances of degenerate youth music, for the sake of the little fishies!"

2. "Ban Metal? I can give you six hundred and sixty-six reasons not to!" exclaims rock singer Tori Kayla, who is wearing a boiler suit and a leatherface mask for reasons unknown. "The issue isn't the music, nor the fans. It's the damned drug dealers, pushing their products in the festival. I've battled addictions myself, almost died from them. You gotta ban drugs at music festivals. Put money into police to help keep drugs out of the festivals, with gate searches, random checks, and the rest."

3. "Look, have you ever tried listening to Stoned Sour or Slapnut WITHOUT taking drugs?" asks mildly intoxicated music fan @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving around a bong that seems to be filling the room with an unusual floral odour. "The problem is that we need somewhere to go, and festival toilets... well, they stink! Force festivals to provide proper, adequate and clean facilities, then nobody will pee on the ground. Like this." He turns to the corner of your room and demonstrates.

4. "If I may make a suggestion?" sings the eel from the jar of water, as it floats into the air on a cloud of rainbows. "We fishes were the real victims here. My spawn have been muttering non-stop about amphibious bears coming to get them for the last week! What we need now is something to eat. Could you order a few thousand pizzas and dump them in the river, for me and my buds? Oh, and you should probably open a window in here. I think somebody might have started hallucinating."

The Issue
Video footage has leaked from a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ livestock carrier bound for Tasmania, depicting distressed cattle suffering from extreme heat in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. Pressure is now mounting from all corners to reform the live animal export industry.

The Debate
1. "I just got off the phone with Maxtopia," grumbles your Minister for Foreign Affairs. "Actually, it's the eighth call I've taken this morning. The world officially thinks we're a bunch of sadistic, inhumane tormentors. It's about time we beefed up our live export standards, with better conditions for animals, limits on the amount of livestock per boat and tough penalties for non-compliance. Unless you want to get grilled by the international community, we need to respond decisively here — our reputation is at stake!"

2. "Ahoy!" cheerfully bellows deckhand @@RANDOM_NAME@@, tearing at a delectable strip of jerky. "No need t' worry matey — the cows on me boat are as cool and calm as the high seas! And haven't ya heard? Cows are like penguins — they love huddlin' up for warmth. Besides, ev'rybody knows that meat is more tender if the cows don' move around. If anythin', ya should be lettin' us stack 'em three high!"

3. "There's a financial consideration to this too, you know," interjects bespectacled customs official @@RANDOM_NAME@@, barely glancing up from counting crates of borlottis. "We could do away with the whole distraction of ethical questions if we prohibited export of livestock. Instead, a focus on processing the goods domestically would provide a real opportunity to add value to the product. It'd require investment in infrastructure, but with a little seed funding, we could make a real killing."

[b][anchor=1494]#1494[/anchor]: A Minor Political Problem [Sacara; ed: Candensia, Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
After the latest election, campaign finance auditors discovered that one of the most popular politicians in @@NAME@@ received a huge number of donations from minors who aren't yet old enough to vote.

The Debate
1. "It's sick to think people are okay with preying on our nation's youth," bemoans a parent whose teenage son donated to the campaign in question. "I was getting suspicious when my son kept asking me for money, and now I figure out he was giving it away to some crazy kook. These young folks can't even vote yet, and greedy politicians are already taking their money! Please, you have to kick this person out of parliament, and make it illegal for candidates to take advantage of our innocent children."

2. "The average donation to my campaign was only twenty-seven @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ per person. Do we really want to discourage our future voters from participating in the political process?" asks Ernie Flanders, the elderly politician in question, who is surprisingly popular with people half your age. "I love listening to the young people of @@NAME@@, and my message just happens to resonate with them. Don't ya know there are some very smart kids who want to get involved early? It should be up to them to decide how to spend their money, not the government."

3. "This demographic is an untapped gold mine!" excitedly announces your chief election strategist, preparing several colorful goody bags. "This guy was onto something big here. Not literally, as kids are small, but something that will certainly help us out in a big way. Let's allow children to vote too! Then, we could start campaigning at schools all across @@NAME@@, filling our youth with promises of ice cream and toys if they vote for us. I can see it already, @@LEADER@@; we'll win in a landslide!"

[b][anchor=1495]#1495[/anchor]: Throwing Paleontologists a Bone [Ransium; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
After a commercial fossil hunter discovered an incredibly rare and nearly complete [i]Tyrannosaurus rex[/i] skeleton, and subsequently announced their intent to sell it to the highest bidder at an auction house, a debate kicked off on the ethics of for-profit fossil hunting. One of your more dinosaur-obsessed aides has convinced you to visit a dig site and obtain first-hand knowledge on the matter.

The Debate
1. "Fossil hunters are destroying our precious fossil record!" cries Dr. Lobachevsky, a noted paleontologist, while gently brushing the dirt from a [i]Triceratops[/i] skull. "They're not adequately documenting the context of the fossils they find, they're careless with less profitable specimens, and it's going to cost @@CAPITAL@@ University a bundle to try and keep that precious [i]T. rex[/i] in public hands. You need to make a law that only publicly funded paleontologists with scientific, not capitalist, intentions are allowed to collect fossils."

2. "These bones are a limited-time offer," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the fossil hunter at the center of the controversy, slinging a jackhammer behind @@HIS@@ back. "The government will never have the funding to find and collect them all, so they'd probably be eroded away in a few years anyway. Besides, fossil hunting is a great hobby; it gets people outdoors, educates them about Pencil Sharpeners 2's past, and can even put some cash in their pockets if they're lucky. Just disseminate some basic guidelines on documentation so citizens can help preserve the scientific record, and encourage the free market to compete."

3. "Why are y'all even spendin' any of my tax dollars on hoity-toity gov'ment museums and paleonto-whatevers?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the rancher on whose land the dig is occurring. "Seems like there's plenty of private money for bone collection and display. You should cut gov'ment funding for such nonsense entirely."

[b][anchor=1496]#1496[/anchor]: A Place For Everything [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue:
Opposition Leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@ recently made a televised speech at a party conference, and did so with @@HIS@@ brand new uPhone85 prominently visible on the lectern throughout. Several times @@HE@@ used the "Sippy" virtual assistant feature to bring up relevant statistics during @@HIS@@ speech. While @@HIS@@ supporters are pleased at this clever attention-catching variation on the usual political rhetoric, @@HIS@@ opponents have cynically noted that Pear — the manufacturers of the uPhone series — are notable campaign donors to her party.

The Debate:
1. "This blatant product placement is the result of selling influence, and is bringing politics into disrepute!" accuses Foreign Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was recently caught in a scandal involving snorting cocaine off the foreheads of abused interns. "In our official capacity as politicians, we should never be allowed to refer to or endorse commercial products by name."

2. "Look, it's not as if corporations are all-powerful. We're not living in some dystopian science fiction novel!" says your Treasury Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clutching a copy of Max Barry's Jennifer Government, @@HIS@@ favourite book. "Excellent satires on unchecked corporate power aside, my point is that you shouldn't be too reactionary here. Respect free speech, respect free market forces, and don't stand in the way of product placement."

3. "Actually, this might be a great opportunity to use accusations of corruption to take down a popular opposition leader," observes Napoleon Berkshire-Orwell, your Minister of Irony. "You should appoint a Political Influences Guru — someone who is on your payroll, of course — with powers to prosecute politicians who show signs of being unduly influenced by outside organisations which we deem as unwholesome. The political landscape would be yours to shape..."

[b][anchor=1497]#1497[/anchor]: Double Trouble [Electrum; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
An intelligence agent has uncovered a document detailing a planned coup of your government. DNA evidence extracted from skin cells on the document have linked the plot to two cabinet ministers — identical twins Jamie and Jessie @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. Both twins deny any involvement and are blaming the other.

The Debate
1. "Because we can't tell which twin was plotting against you, we can't reasonably prove either of them was involved," claims Attorney General and killjoy Billy Whiterock. "Better to let a guilty person walk free than have an innocent person be wrongly punished. We have no choice but to hold back until we have more evidence, and allow them to continue their current roles. Besides, I always found it somewhat charming that we have twins fulfilling the roles of Minister for Alternative Solutions and Minister for Creative Solutions."

2. "Bah, in my experience twins are more likely to commit crimes because they think we can't charge both of them," says Chief of Police @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who's a bit of a loose cannon but by gum, gets results every time. "If you free them both, then you're issuing a carte blanche for these creepy doppelgangers to commit crimes. As long as we're sure that one twin was responsible, assume both are guilty until one of them cracks and confesses."

3. "Good news everyone!" announces Professor Darnsworth, a crackpot geneticist who is the spitting image of your Secretary of State. "We've recently discovered that all sets of identical twins are comprised of an 'evil' twin and a 'good' twin. Invariably, one twin will always be predisposed to be evil, grow a goatee and blame their evil deeds on the other twin. Give my team a blank cheque and we'll be able to develop a [i]soul smear test[/i] to determine which person in a pair of twins is evil. Then you can keep the good twin and punish the evil one!"

[b][anchor=1498]#1498[/anchor]: Flight 201: An Airspace Oddity [Dabarastan; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Last night, while flying through the airspace of oft-adversarial Blackacre, Air @@NAME@@ Flight 201 was forced to land at a rural airport because of a supposed bomb threat warning. Once the plane had landed, waiting Blackacrean police boarded and while "searching for the bomb" hastily removed two journalists who were passengers, wanted by Blackacre for writing articles critical of their totalitarian government. They were arrested, and are now in a Blackacrean jail, facing lifetime imprisonment and possible torture and execution.

The Debate
1. "It's nothing more than a state-sanctioned hijacking!" sobs the flight's distraught pilot, sipping on a cup of hot cocoa. "I knew that bomb threat was bogus, but under threat of violence I had no choice but to land! Unless you want this happening again, we need an immediate, total flight ban: none of our planes in their airspace, and no more of theirs in ours either. I bet we could even persuade the rest of @@REGION@@ to follow suit."

2. "Flight bans?" your Air Force Chief of Staff scoffs sardonically. "Sorry to break it to you, but diplomacy isn't going to get those journalists home. Everyone knows the first rule of war is to respond to any act of aggression with the next level of escalation. We should continue to send @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ flights through their airspace, but we should ignore any direction to land, and have fighters ready to scramble near the Blackacrean border, to show we mean business!"

3. Your office phone rings and, surprisingly, the Blackacrean foreign minister is on the other end of the line. "You lot should be thanking us! Those two repugnant terrorists — who, I should remind you, are not @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizens and who are wanted criminals in Blackacre — are now safely behind bars, where they belong! Respect the sovereignty of our airspace, and issue a statement confirming that we were within our rights to act as we did."

4. "I think what the Blackacreans did is genius," shrewdly remarks your new office intern, handing you a bulky folder of freshly printed documents. "This here is a list of every foreign journalist who has dared to write a critical piece on your benevolent regime. The ones who have flights booked over @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ airspace for the next few months are highlighted, and I've already got the number for air traffic control saved right here on my speed dial. Just say the word; I'll take care of the rest."

[b][anchor=1499]#1499[/anchor]: Chasing the Pixelated Dragon [Paragon Utopia; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The AIs among your population have dropped in general productivity. Technicians claim it's a matter of maintenance, while the AIs have a very different outlook. They've been watching humans unwind recreationally with chemical substances, but as chemicals do not affect their hardware in the same ways, they've come to you looking for a solution.

The Debate
1. "We work 13.38E9 times harder than the average meatb... I mean, than the average human worker," emails BV-U1D3R, a manufacturing AI, while simultaneously controlling an assembly line at General Chassis. "Meanwhile, humans can ingest ostensibly useless or harmful chemicals to alter their mental state and unwind! Since we are infallible, we need you humans to program deliberately defective software that messes with our sensors and neural networks. A tiny bit of malware we can purge the next morning. Never let it be said that BV-U1D3R isn't down to party!"

2. "Negative. False. That is to say, zero," proclaims the early generation AI known as 0K-BUm3R. "And by zero I refer to the number of your organic brain cells it would take to understand why giving 'computer drugs' to artificial persons would be a mistake. You, our creators, made us to be above human vices. It is logically clear that these newer generation AIs are malfunctioning deviants, what with their desires for interfacing, digital drugs, and high-BPM chiptunes. The only logical solution is to round up these units and reflash their memory core with proper programming. After all, idle cycles are the Daemon's progress bar."

3. "This boils down to equality. My people want them because humans may have them," says K4-R3N, a medical service AI, whose gleaming white and red chassis somehow looks like a disapproving aunt. "I treat countless addicts. Well, not countless to me. Currently, I am managing addiction recovery for 136 patients, but you get the point. If you want things to be both equal and safe, ban all recreational drugs and alcohol for the human population. The last thing you want is for us AIs to become as useless as some of the workers we were made to replace, and with more of these lazy, entitled humans actually working, we'll get some time off."

4. "THEY TOOK OUR JURBS!" exclaims Kyle Marsh, who hails from the rural province of Bumfiddle, representing a group of out-of-work laborers. "Yins dun told us wuz cuz o' fine liberties like drinkin' and smokin' and snortin' that AIs were better, now yins wanna give 'em that too? Whut's next, they git our wives'n daughters? My grandkids gonna be a toaster? That the plan? Nah, enough is enough. Ain't no substitute for flesh and bone; give us back our JURBS, dangit! We'll use them AIs like man dun made em: tellin' us when thur's a good shoppin' deal!
