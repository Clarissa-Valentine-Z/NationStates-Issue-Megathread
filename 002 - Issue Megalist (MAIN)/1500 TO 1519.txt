[b][anchor=1500]#1500[/anchor]: Rodents of Unusual Sociability [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
Your brother's pet guinea pig has been looking a little down recently, and a pet psychiatrist has revealed that this is a consequence of loneliness.

The Debate
1. "Guinea pigs are social animals, you know, and they don't like to be alone," murmurs the psychiatrist, snuggling close to you and purring gently. "It should be illegal for pet owners to have just a single guinea pig. In fact, there's a whole bunch of rules we should make to enhance the psychological wellbeing of domestic pets. I've a list back at my place, if you want to pop over this evening, look it over, maybe share a fondue..."

2. "It's unfair to pile cost burdens on those of us who can't afford a second pet," complains your brother, adjusting his guinea pig's sterling silver tiara and frilly silk ballet skirt. "An owner can give all the affection a pet needs. Though of course, it'd be nice if the state could pick up the bill for pet psychiatry. You'd like that, wouldn't you Snooflette?"

3. "Pet psychiatrists, state nannying, ugh! This is big government gone mad!" spits your Minister of Constructive Dismissal, whose own department doubled in size last year. "Look, you've got a TV spot on @@ANIMAL@@ News tonight to talk about budgets or something or other; why don't you use a minute of that to tell people that guinea pigs need companions? Quick, to the point, and most importantly, at no cost to the taxpayer."

4. "If a guinea pig is too miserable, its owner can just dispose of it and get a happier-looking one," suggests passer-by Lola Bale, tossing a pet cat into a nearby wheeled bin. "Darwinism will take care of the rest, and within a few generations you'll have a selected population of guinea pigs that doesn't mind being alone."

[b][anchor=1501]#1501[/anchor]: Diamond in the Rough [Ransium; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
After a golf course in North @@CAPITAL@@ was forced to close due to a series of unexplained explosions, the city government purchased the land with the intention of converting it back to the original bogland. However, just before the conversion process was about to tee off, an environmental survey found a population of the non-native, but endangered, Marche Noire Diamond-Backed Gopher off the fourth hole.

The Debate
1. "Four!" cries grassland ecologist @@RANDOMNAME@@. "This is one of only four known Geomys annoyus populations. The other three are in Marche Noire, but with their lax environmental regulations they are likely to be bulldozed to make room for a military base within the week. Keeping the species existent in the wild — even if it's in a man-made habitat outside of its native range — is more important than a few acres of bogland. Remember: two wrongs don't make a right, but three rights make a left."

*2. "That's ridiculous," exclaims bogland ecologist @@RANDOMNAME@@ while swinging a putter at your desk to drive home @@HIS@@ point. "There is precious little bogland left in @@NAME@@; this land could be converted into a habitat that would support a great diversity of native @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ species. Put the gophers in a zoo or something." [[color=blue]Must not ban zoos[/color]]

*3. "That's ridiculous," exclaims bogland ecologist @@RANDOMNAME@@ while swinging a putter at your desk to drive home @@HIS@@ point. "There is precious little bogland left in @@NAME@@; this land could be converted into a habitat that would support a great diversity of native @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ species. Put the gophers in a zoo or something. Yes, I know that zoos aren't legal. Maybe we should make an exception here." [[color=red]Must ban zoos[/color]]

4. "Those gophers are what drove the golf course out of business in the first place," rants @@RANDOMNAME@@, the golf course's former groundskeeper, while playing with a strange-smelling modeling clay. "And I couldn't kill 'em cause I couldn't use any of the good poisons because of stupid @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ environmental regulations. If those regulations were loosened a bit, maybe I wouldn't be out of a job and back living with my mother. But she does give me pancakes in the morning, so I got that goin' for me, which is nice."

[b][anchor=1502]#1502[/anchor]: Dirty Deals [Jutsa; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Corporations from the United Federation have offered to pay your nation to take care of their garbage.

The Debate
1. “I’m sure you’ll fahnd this here business proposal’s in yer beyust interest, pardner,” suggests Mr. Natas, the CEO of Got Garbage? Inc., lifting his 20-gallon hat over his star-shaped rose-tinted sunglasses. “You’ve got the supplah— of space that iyus, and we’ve got the demayund. Just sahn here, if you would please.”

2. “Don’t you dare sign a deal with this devil,” frantically warns your Minister of Skepticism, holding a magnifying glass up to the contract. “Our coastlines are delicate enough without the addition of some foreigner’s pizza boxes, broken glass, and literal **** floating around in them. Publicly condemn this practice and threaten trade sanctions against any nation that engages in exporting OR importing waste products.”

*3. “There’s a way to satisfy both eco-friendliness and profit,” suggests your Financial Minister, who appears to be going through your wastepaper basket for any unwanted paperclips. “They’re actually going to pay us to take this precious resource! Think about it — we could sift out reusable items and recyclable materials from careless, lazy foreigners, and then sell it back to those same bums for profit! Along the way, we generate a multitude of jobs for skilled workers, especially those with small, nimble, fast hands, like all those unemployed six-to-twelve year olds who could be making money for their families. Which is a good thing, right?” [color=purple]Must have Child Labour[/color]

[b][anchor=1503]#1503[/anchor]: The Scent of Sexism [San Laurenz; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Personal products giant Duolever has come under fire for how it markets its Pickaxe line of deodorants, body washes, and shampoos for men. The TV and poster ads feature scantily clad female glamour models swooning over a man, seemingly rendered helpless by the Pickaxe scent.

The Debate
1. “This simply cannot stand!” objects Ivanka Bronte, leader of the feminist activist group Women Hating Injustices, No Exceptions. “This blatant objectification makes women look like helpless prizes to be won, rather than thinking individuals. We should make this abhorrent corporation withdraw these adverts, and make it illegal to depict women in sexist or objectified ways in product advertising. That’ll teach ‘em!” She crosses her arms and glares at you, judgmentally.

2. “Bah, this old bat doesn’t know what she’s saying,” says Ammon Hart, Duolever’s marketing director. “We sell personal care products for men, so we market to men. It’s only natural we sell them their desires. These feminists confuse sexiness with sexism, and basically just resent seeing women who look better than them. Nobody forced these glamour models to pose for us! You should let companies market to people however they want. A freer market is a better market, I always say.”

3. “This crackpot buffoon is the problem!” says male rights activist Mordecai Ono. “It isn’t women that are being objectified here, it’s men! They treat us like our only goal is sex, and that’s all we care about. The only way to remedy this is by ridding this nation of the negative depictions of men society has become so familiar with, and paying more attention to the struggles men face!”

[b][anchor=1504]#1504[/anchor]: Asking for a Raise [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
Your country’s tough anti-gambling stance has shut down most casino games, but now a coalition of former card players are asking for your permission to play their high-stakes poker games. Their reasoning? They say poker is a game of skill, not chance.

The Debate
1. “Hard evidence shows that skill matters more than luck,” explains Mitchell Coren-Victoria, a former pro-player turned TV celebrity. “It’s been demonstrated that the top centile of players over a six-month period are more than twelve times as likely as average players to repeat the feat in the following six months. That’s more statistical consistency than most sports players. Poker isn’t gambling, but a test of mathematics and quick wits. Ante up, Leader, and let this game of skill be played.”

2. “Honestly, gambling as a whole is all about smart play and clever tabletalk,” observes Adele Sheldonson, a former casino owner. “The misplaced moral puritanism behind gambling restriction fails to recognise that gaming is a sign of a healthy and active mind. I think it’s time you folded on this, and let people gamble again. The economy improves, people get to have fun, I make a little money. Everybody wins!”

3. “It’s always so tempting to backslide into sin, isn’t it?” murmurs your uncle, staring into the middle distance at a passing flock of sheep and licking his lips for a moment, before snapping back to the present. “Restricting gambling wasn’t enough. You should make temptation harder to find. Ban playing cards. Ban dice. Ban poker chips. Anything that might tempt people to gamble, ban it.”

4. “Boss, you’ve got to see the game behind the game here,” interjects your anti-gambling chief from the shadows. “There’s three rules poker players should follow. First rule is that there’s always a hidden agenda. Turn the tables on these ‘former’ poker players, and bring them in for forceful interrogation so we can persuade them to really show their hand. It’s not enough to just ban paraphernalia — we need to scare these gambling interests into submission. Second rule, of course, is that you also shouldn’t tell anybody everything. Let’s keep this action quiet so that we can maintain our advantage over the secret gamblers.”

[b][anchor=1505]#1505[/anchor]: A Tangled Web [Gudicia; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
A startling new report has revealed that the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ government’s website fails to meet even the most basic accessibility guidelines. In one case, deaf users were instructed to watch a fifteen-minute video with no subtitles in order to be eligible for government support. Following this revelation, disability rights groups are demanding action.

The Debate
1. “This is degrading!” shouts disability advocate @@RANDOMNAME@@, as she tries to reach a nearby microphone from her wheelchair. “Government should be designed for everyone, regardless of ability. We need to make sure that all taxpayer-funded websites are accessible for people with disabilities. How can we move forward when we leave our most vulnerable behind?”

2. “Why stop there?” questions Communications Minister and keyboard warrior @@RANDOMNAME@@, furiously typing on his phone as he steps forward. “Plenty of websites are terrible for people with disabilities. We need to establish a new internet regulator to ensure that everything on the web is accessible! Plus, it will give me — um, I mean, the government — greater control over what can go online. What’s not to love?”

3. “No way,” decries Arms Manufacturing spokesperson Arthur Nimoy, as he quickly attempts to delete the browser history on his laptop. “I’m sick of Big Government wasting our tax money and regulating every minute of our lives. Government websites should just redirect people to the vastly superior options that are available from the private sector — and don’t you dare interfere with private websites if you value free speech! Without the need for an army of government IT dorks, us ordinary citizens should be able to get a decent tax cut.”

4. “My dear, you mustn’t forget those of us who suffer from macular degeneration and other age-related disabilities,” interjects your grandmother, who appears to have nimbly evaded the staff from her nursing home. “How are we supposed to access government services if we can’t even read the blasted computer screens? Why not just go back to in-person service, with government offices in every town? We don’t need none of this fancy computer stuff. Some good ol’ fashioned pencil-pushing would do @@NAME@@ some good.”

[b][anchor=1506]#1506[/anchor]: A Need for Order [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Global politics often require you to meet with politicians from other nations, both at carefully choreographed ceremonies and state dinners, as well as during smaller and more unstructured affairs. So it is, you find yourself in a high-end @@CAPITAL@@ restaurant with the diminutive Minister of Trade from the tiny but politically significant nation of Smalltopia, along with his wife. After you have all studied the menu for a while the waiter arrives. The Smalltopian fellow orders the linguine for himself and — without even turning to look at his wife — orders the same for her. Her eyes turned downwards, she says nothing, clearly used to him taking control. The media’s cameras look to you, to see how you will respond.

The Debate
1. A dozen yards away your Minister of Pressed Curd Global Distribution is making frantic hand gestures to discourage you from commenting, and pointing to the menu to indicate that you should order the same thing. Maybe he thinks that a man ordering for a woman is just old-fashioned charm? Or perhaps he is worried that you’re going to upset the delicately negotiated bilateral cheese export deal he closed just before dinner?

2. Shoving her way into your eyeline, your militantly feminist Minister for Equality looks frankly furious. She gesticulates angrily and glares daggers at the Smalltopian minister’s back. Looks like she thinks you ought to be making a point of checking with the timorous lady to see if she wants to order her own food.

3. At the edge of the room, strategically positioned near the exit, one of your loyal aides points to his mobile phone, asking if you want him to pretend you’ve got an urgent call that will take you away from this awkward dinner. After all, you could always rearrange this meeting some other time, in a menu-free environment. The ballet is good this year, you’ve heard.

[b][anchor=1507]#1507[/anchor]: Busting to Go [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: TBD][/b]

The Issue
“...and thusly, this must now be considered under the sixteen sections and three hundred and twenty-four subsections of the Dunnage and Silage Act 1935, which I will now recite...” It’s been nine hours, and the undersecretary to the vice leader of the opposition isn’t done filibustering, a legislative tactic that you recently approved. Even with a flask of coffee, a plate of croissants and a well-used bucket provided to you by a thoughtful aide, this is proving to be a real trial. Surprisingly, the speaker stops for a moment and addresses you directly.

The Debate
1) “Look here, @@LEADER@@, you know that I can go on like this till the end of session, and I can pick it up again tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after,” she says, almost threateningly. “Why don’t we both save ourselves some trouble and provide the option for a minority quorum of legislators to declare their intention to filibuster indefinitely without needing to actually filibuster? A virtual filibuster if you will. It recognises the need for filibusters to exist while not wasting time that you could be using on the business of government.”

2) “And that’s democracy, is it?” counters your Minister of Tyrannical Majorities, taking your bucket to pour down the sink. “We should have some mechanism to bust filibusters, perhaps with a three-fifths majority vote of legislators being enough to declare that a debate has ended, and that the vote proper should take place without further delay. That’s called cloture, boss, which I believe is foreign-talk for guillotining a blatherer’s noggin off. Metaphorically, of course!”

3) “Honestly, this whole thing is making a mockery of the legislative process,” interjects your brother, who technically isn’t allowed to be in here, and who has been throwing peanut shells at the speaker with varying degrees of accuracy for the last forty-five minutes. “If you want her to stop talking, then you need to flush her out by making her as uncomfortable as possible. Ban food, drinks and buckets on the floor and prevent the speaker from accepting points of order that conveniently give time for respite.”

4) “Chaps, this IS the system working, don’t you see?” explains an elder statesman, who has woken from a short nap, and is still wearing his nightcap. “The mechanisms of democracy have tangled the powers-that-be into blissful inaction, and befuddled the populace beneath a barrage of bureaucratic bewitchery. Politics drags on, the entire process of government is kicked to the long grass, and the country prospers because old fools like us don’t try to run things. Just sit back, listen, relax. The decades will fly by, and before you know it you’ll be retiring to the quango, cushy corporate advisory role or tropical island of your choice.” A black cat walks past and for a moment you experience a weird sense of déjà vu.

[b][anchor=1508]#1508[/anchor]: Kicking Out the Competition [Mertagne; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
The top clubs in the nation’s @@ANIMAL@@ball League have expressed interest in leaving the domestic competition to join the closed, elite @@REGION@@ @@ANIMAL@@ball Super League instead. @@ANIMAL@@ball fans are worried that the state of competition in @@NATION@@ will suffer as a result.

The Debate
1. “Fans. Before. Funds.” gasps @@ANIMAL@@ball fan Edward Bonaparte, putting his vuvuzela down after blowing it between each word. “Any plucky team should have the chance to compete against the best through gumption and a love of the sport. Our teams shouldn’t be denied this chance just because the filthy rich teams want to run off to the Super League to schmooze with the elites. They should remain where they are. Come on, ref!”

2. “This is the invisible boot of the free market at work!” says @@RANDOMNAME@@, the owner of Athletico @@CAPITAL@@ who’s been too busy to attend her own team’s matches for over two years. “The opportunities are endless. Television rights, tourists flocking to our shiny new stadiums, the exposure of our players across @@REGION@@! Besides, what would you rather watch? Athletico beating the Tumbleweed Minnows into a pulp or Athletico squaring off against the likes of Foxchester United in a weekly, televised spectacle? I know which one I’d choose.”

3. “If you ask me, there’s a better way,” claims your groundskeeper, a connoisseur of obscure sports. “I’ve seen gridiron played over in the United Federation where the worst teams get the best rookies from a draft system. Picks, fair and simple, just like how I choose the flowers for your garden each year. Why not enforce that system here? It’d certainly level the playing field and remove all the exclusivity and unlimited money surrounding the established teams.”
