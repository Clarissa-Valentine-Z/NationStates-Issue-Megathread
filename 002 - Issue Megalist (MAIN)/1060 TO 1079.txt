[b][anchor=1060]#1060[/anchor]: Hole in the Wall [Singapore no2; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A close shave occurred yesterday when, during a severe downpour, one of the nation's reclaimed coastal areas was nearly flooded due to a small dike section giving way. Thankfully, passing cargo ship [i]The Silver Skate[/i] happened to be packed to the gills with sandbags, and the captain of the ship graciously unloaded the cargo, plugging the dike and saving the day. Despite the happy resolution, concerns surrounding the dikes still remain.

The Debate
1. "I'm happy to have been able to lend a hand," chats Captain Hans Blinker, fixing the wobbly leg on your desk with a folded-up business card. "I was on my way to deliver my regular shipment of sand to Macronesia when I noticed that your dike was springing a leak. Now, I think that this incident shows that more thorough maintenance of your dikes is necessary. You should probably slow down expansion into low-lands and coastal areas, and focus more on securing your existing land."

2. "Perhaps we should rethink and halt land reclamation," insists your Environment Minister, phoning in from @@HIS@@ beachfront house. "Not only does it cause irreversible damage to local marine wildlife, killing off coral reefs and polluting the sea, but it's also incredibly expensive. We should be living in harmony with the environment we have, not forcing it into new shapes."

3. "What's more important, some stupid fishes or the survival of our nation?" rebukes Head of Strategic Thinking @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pointing angrily at a map of @@REGION@@. "We need to be expanding our coastlines more aggressively! Forget dikes, we need to be building whole islands and peninsulas to lay claim to so-called 'international waters' as quickly as we can! What's the cost of a few quadrillion tonnes of stone compared to the benefits this could bring?"

The Issue
After many days of loud and obnoxious cars speeding through the main streets of @@CAPITAL@@, a bill that proposes a mandatory muffler muting for motor vehicles has been presented to you.

The Debate
1. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a tired-looking single parent, pleads for change. "Have you ever tried sleeping while these high-speed hooligans are making noise through the night? It's torture! Whenever they go by, my kids wake up crying, and I get zero rest! Make mufflers an absolute must..." @@HE@@ yawns loudly, then drops onto your floor, fast asleep.

2. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a member of the feared but mostly harmless [i]Rabid @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ gang[/i], pulls up in @@HIS@@ beefed-up 4x4 diesel truck. "Hell, no! Can you really bring yourself to tame a beast like this with mufflers? Where's your sense of fun? In fact, let's make @@NAME@@ the loudest nation in @@REGION@@, and subsidise great cool auto manufacturers making great cool cars."

3. Looking a little nervous, environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ whispers a few words in your ear. "I think we can do better than a few mufflers. Instead, we could insist that all engines should be fully electric - this will eliminate engine noise entirely. You'll have to push this through quickly with an executive order though, or Big Oil lobbyists will surely shut it down.

The Issue
Blackacre, a nation historically opposed to @@NAME@@, has declared that their submarine [i]Violet November[/i] has gone missing, and are keen to scour the area where it was last spotted â€” just off the edge of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ continental shelf.

The Debate
1. "Thank you for meeting with me on such short notice, @@Leader@@," says Tyrone Lancaster, a diminutive Blackacrean ambassador. "Our submarine was just a training vessel that got erm... blown off course... or something. But the main issue here is saving the thirty crew members that are on board before their oxygen runs out! Any kind of help will be greatly appreciated: freedom of movement for our search boats, logistical aid, rescue teams, engineers... This is such a great opportunity for our two nations to start on a path towards greater friendship."

2. "A training vessel? Yeah! Right!" exclaims Rear Admiral @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ as the ambassador leaves your office. "I bet all my navy ribbons that we're talking about a spy sub or a nuke platform! Those Blackacreans are always stirring up trouble and encroaching into our territorial waters. You should have our own submarines, frigates and destroyers search out and destroy unauthorised military vessels, including this sub, once we find it! That will give them something to think about before trespassing here again."

[b][anchor=1063]#1063[/anchor]: Playing It by the Numbers [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
Your somewhat gullible nephew has returned from a shopping trip laden with 'bargains', including a dozen suits which he says were '50%-off'. Upon whipping out the office magnifying glass it appears that the discount stickers have 'up to' written in tiny letters just above the numbers, and a quick check of the store catalogue shows most of the items had their prices raised just days before to accommodate the so-called discount. All in all, his shopping trip has cost him twice what he would have paid if he had been charged the manufacturers' recommended prices.

The Debate
1. "Look, we all know that my son is an idiot," says your sister irritably, smacking the kid around the head, "but anyone could be misled by these tricks and number games. You don't approve of con-men, do you? These retailers are legal con-men. For the sake of the consumer you must legislate fair and transparent pricing in retail, and prevent misleading advertising."

2. "I've made a couple of bad shopping decisions..." admits your nephew, straightening the creases on the sleeves of his lime-green velvet onesie. "Alright, maybe more than a couple. But I love bargain hunting! The thrill of finding a 75%-reduced top hat for only 200 @@CURRENCY@@ is something you can't duplicate! All we need is a universal 30-day cooling off period, during which customers can claim a refund, no questions asked. You know, just in case their tyrannical mothers are nagging them."

3. "We'll offer your nephew a One-Off Full Refund, and I'll even throw in the buttonholes for free next time!" promises @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Dibbler, the appointed representative of a consortium of retailers, audibly capitalising certain words. "And that's practically cutting my own throat. All we ask is that you let the Free Market operate, for the sake of Freedom. FREEEEDOM. Up to 99% of voters agree that advertising is the core of a successful economy! Our industry is in the top 100% when it comes to ethical business practices and serving the public good. I myself donate up to 50% of my wage to charity!"

4. "In my day, a pint of milk cost what a pint of milk cost," grumbles @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@, an elderly cleaner interjecting from the back of the room. "You're the government; you should set a fixed price for everything, and you should do that other thing, seizing the means of production, and wot-not. We don't need satin pants or hats with feathers on them. We just need what we needs: bread, milk and wot-not, and at a fair price."

A family from @@NAME@@ was arrested while on holiday in Tasmania for taking a photo of their child urinating in Lake Sacred - a cultural icon that is revered by all Tasmanians. This incident, and others of @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ behaving badly while abroad, has resulted in a national debate about how uncivilized @@NAME@@ appears to the rest of @@REGION@@.

The Debate
1. "We are the laughing stock of @@REGION@@," opines your mother, as she picks up the litter on the floor of your office. "We need to draw up a list of government-sanctioned guidelines to show @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ how to behave properly in the countries they are visiting, and require that all travel agents hand over a copy to anyone who books a foreign holiday. We need to understand that, although some @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ urinate in fountains and throw rubbish everywhere here, it is not acceptable in other countries."

2. "Unfortunately, that won't be enough to change our bad habits," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your old school teacher, as @@HE@@ orders one of your aides to take out the rubbish bin. "Every time I go out, I see an awful lot of people jumping queues and a few even spitting in restaurants. Have we no shame? Well, I've had enough; I say we ban all citizens from leaving @@NAME@@. Then we will no longer embarrass ourselves in the eyes of @@REGION@@."

3. Your glamorous secretary, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, checks her perfectly coiffed hair to make sure not a strand is out of place. Wearing her elegant branded dress, she sits coyly and gracefully crosses her stockinged feet. She then sneezes into her palm and wipes the snot all over her clothes. "Who cares what the rest of @@REGION@@ thinks? I like the way we @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ are. If those other nations think we're rude, then that's their problem! In fact, why don't we build exhibitions in the other capital cities of @@REGION@@, showcasing our way of doing things? That way, they will stop criticising us and understand us better."

[b][anchor=1065]#1065[/anchor]: Pulling Out [Jutsa; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati] [/b]

The Issue
Several nations that are party to the international climate treaty have been falling short of the treaty's set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A few nations have even decided to withdraw from the agreement, leaving many worried about the future of the treaty and the planet.

The Debate
1. "Did they really just pull out and leave us?" histrionically shrieks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your country's biggest advocates for signing the climate agreement. "We must not be impotent; we need to compensate for the rest of the world's dangerous, lazy indifference. We need to significantly increase our ecological protection funding while also trying harder to decimate carbon emissions. It'll all be worth it in the end when our nation isn't under the sea."

*2. "We can't just take this lying down. We've gotta give those no-good double-crossers what they're asking for â€” death and destruction!" fumes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a radical environmentalist obsessed with guns and big bazookas. "Show them their economies really will suffer by convincing our fellow signatories to put trade sanctions on any nation that chooses to withdraw. If they still don't comply, we'll wage a whippin' war against them. Then we can whip our more negligent partners into shape as well. Hey, they consented to it; they signed the treaty." [[color=blue]Must not be an autarky[/color]]

*3. "We can't just take this lying down. We've gotta give those no-good double-crossers what they're asking for â€” death and destruction!" fumes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a radical environmentalist obsessed with guns and big bazookas. "Show them their economies really will suffer by convincing our fellow signatories to wage a whippin' war against any nation that chooses to withdraw. Then we can whip our more negligent partners into shape as well. Hey, they consented to it; they signed the treaty." [[color=red]Must be an autarky[/color]]

4. "So, you want to help our planet by bombing other countries?" mockingly interrogates Catherine Gratwick, recent victor of the Annual @@CAPITAL@@ Dance-Off. "Forcing nations back into the agreement won't help; in fact, they may be on to something here. If our treaty partners can't keep up with the pace, we might need to take things slow and propose a reduction in treaty obligations to the other member states. Communication is key in a relationship, and it will certainly stop our friends from pulling out in the future."

5. "Or, maybe ya should just forget about this here nonsense 'cuz it's junk anyhoo," rants an ambassador from the United Federation, thrusting a two-foot-long, fried, bacon-wrapped Mega Hot Dog Deluxe Supremeâ„¢ into his ten-gallon mug of Moonbucks coffee. "Even if clahmate changes were really caused by men, stahfling economical progress will only tarnish yer abilities to fahnd betta ways of doin' thangs. If you quickly pull out now and denounce this here treaty for the DÃ guÃ³ hoax it is, you will sure be much better off â€” just lahk us!"

The Issue
You're shopping with your cousin, who wishes to buy the new small-press pro-LGBT novel, [i]The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Boy[/i]. As you approach the @@CAPITAL@@ branch of national bookshop chain, [i]Books 'n' Bits[/i], you notice a vociferous group of dour protesters picketing outside, brandishing signs that read Morals: @@NAME@@

The Debate
1. "Hey-hey, ho-ho! Bring back the shame; sin's got to go!" chants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the sunburned leader of the protest. "@@LEADER@@, we've been out here for hours. We've jumped out at these miscreants, shouting such bone-trembling litanies of outrage that their bowels should've shaken in terror. And they've laughed and bought this [i]@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Boy[/i] filth anyway. Politics in @@NAME@@ are dominated by liberal commie fascists and atheist Cyanists. Only you can halt the vice. We need to purge these sexual inverts from society, cleanse the socialist dross from the streets and hail the simple purity of one correct faith."

2. "Look, let them say whatever bull they want in their homes or in their religious bulletins, or whatever it is that people don't pay attention to," groans bookshop manager @@RANDOM_NAME@@, straining to get out of @@HIS@@ door. "But these nutters are obstructing my pavement and causing my customers vexation with their damnation agitation. Will you please just get the police here to move them along, and clamp down on any protest that's disturbing the peace and interfering with honest trade?"

3. "Interfering with trade?" chortles the book's author, signing copies so quickly that @@HE@@ fails to notice @@HE@@'s also signed a fan's sleeve. "I think it's wonderful. Without these crackpots showing up to the biggest bookshop in the country, ranting and attracting press coverage, my book might never have been noticed. Now, it's due to go into its second printing, and they want to buy the film rights. We ought to encourage free speech and give airtime to every point of view, no matter how loopy. This bad publicity from a bunch of fundie losers is the best advertising that money can't buy!"

4. "That's the last thing we should do!" gasps human rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, still waiting to get into the bookshop. "We can't allow hate groups to upset decent, hardworking @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@. In fact â€“ whatever someone's viewpoint â€“ we must ensure that all public discourse is polite, inoffensive and unobtrusive. If people can't discuss things politely and calmly, then maybe we should issue a list of acceptable topics for public discourse. Then, everyone will be able to enjoy our shared spaces, and no-one will ever feel upset."

The Issue
Maxx Grass Corporation and Green Way Growers, two of the largest marijuana producers in the nation, recently announced a merger that is expected to be worth billions. As the recreational drug industry continues to grow, many are wondering if this joint venture is right for @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "Let's just hold our horses on all this 'merger' talk," murmurs Commerce Minister @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ 'Trust Buster' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ polishes an oversized walking stick. "If these two companies merge, the resulting behemoth would monopolize at least 75% of the industry. How would any of the smaller businesses be able to compete? For the good of our many hard-working entrepreneurs who are just trying to sell enough weed to put food on the table, we must block this merger, and hash out some legislation to prevent this situation from recurring."

2. "These companies are making record profits off the green stuff!" notes your Finance Minister, who is wearing a Maxtopian Grass t-shirt. "It's high time that the government got involved. Rather than blocking the merger, why don't we just become the competition? We already have trade access to the far-flung locations that produce rare strains like Manamana Maneater and Brasilistan Bomber. We'll also be able to guarantee the quality of our products and maintain purity levels that you just won't find in the private industry. Imagine what we can do with the sales revenue!"

3. "Why should we allow private companies to reap all the rewards, man?" asks your stoner brother after obnoxiously puffing some Maxtopian Grass smoke in your face. "The government should like, nationalize the drug industry! These corporations are like, totally evil and they freak me out. Marijuana distribution would be way safer in government hands. Down with Big Drugs!"

4. "I think that stuff's getting to your head," replies @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of Maxx Grass Corporation, while rolling @@HIS@@ eyes. "I'll have you know that two percent of our profits are donated to local schools, hospitals, and crime prevention programs. If the government were to muscle in on our turf, it would make them no better than the shady drug dealers of old, and would reduce the amount of money that we could donate. If anything, the government should let us continue with the merger so that we can expand our business across @@NAME@@ with as little red tape as possible."

The Issue
After a hectic work week, you were finally due some time off for a nice Sunday brunch with your family. But as you were waiting for your TurboLux 3000 Toaster to toast your bread, it started frantically buzzing and rattling, finally popping out two slices of bread burnt like charcoal. Worse still, your mother purchased the kitchen appliance for you only 366 days ago, and its warranty expired yesterday.

The Debate
1. "Oh, sweetie, I know it is exasperating when an electrical appliance gives up the ghost too soon!" your mum laments, while she pours you tea. "Yesterday our coffee machine broke, too. You know, when I was a young and dazzling girl, everything was made to last for a lifetime. You remember my sewing machine? It was a gift from my sister, and it still works like I bought it yesterday! You should make it so that all products have to have a lifetime warranty, darling. I'm sure manufacturers would do their best to produce durable stuff, then."

2. "No! Terrible idea!" sputters your uncle, one of the company directors of TurboLux Household Appliances, spewing out his tea onto his croissant. "If you extend the warranties, people will just break their stuff on purpose to get cutting-edge new devices. I think we would fare far better if you abolished warranty requirements altogether. Why should my company give people free replacements just because they were too lazy or too stupid to read the user manual and ended up breaking their stuff? Present company excepted, of course."

3. "The problem is capitalism. Now take a look at this beauty!" exclaims Carlo Max, who claims to be a distant cousin of yours, as he struggles to lift a massive metal box onto the dining table. "My East-Lebatuck-made toaster has been working for three decades now! Obsolescence, be it planned or fashion-based, is a symptom of a throw-away society wriggling in the merciless grip of consumerism. How about you hand over the production of all goods to the State? Without the need for greed, the State will make everything to last."

A survey of the plumbing industry has noted that in recent times toilet basin sizes and flush volumes have been on the increase.

The Debate
1. "Giant toilets are a giant problem," declares environmentalist @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Shatter. "The nation generates a considerable carbon footprint and a great deal of chemical waste to create tap-quality water for your households, then you dump a quarter to a half of it back into the sewers through flushing. We need regulations to set a maximum basin and flush volume, to prevent us being so wasteful with water."

2. "Aw come on, I need a powerful flush!" complains generously proportioned food-lover @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Creosote. "Look, when you've got a Brancaland Steamer coming down the way, you don't want it sailing in a shallow river. I pay my water bill; I bought my throne! My business is not the government's business!"

3. "Up the creek without a paddle? I've got a compromise solution," smiles bright-looking junior minister @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ GÃ¼ldenschauer. "You could tax drinking-quality water on the monthly bills, but let people use untreated greywater at a discount. This will give people incentive to use drinking water only for drinking."

4. "Big job? Big science has the answer!" enthuses experimental biologist @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Middenmarch. "Why not flush a little money in the direction of developing my newest innovation? I call it The Eater. This bio-toilet uses engineered friendly bacteria to efficiently digest human waste, and produces a tank full of methane bio-fuel as a side product. Good for the environment, good for cutting household bills, basically just really good sh..." The noisy flatulence of your junior minister cuts her words short.

The Issue
@@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, one of your party's rising stars, has come under intense scrutiny after incendiary and offensive comments made several years ago were discovered on @@HIS@@ social media profiles.

The Debate
1. "How unfair this is!" wails the disgraced politician, throwing @@HIM_1@@self a pity party in your office. "There's no way I can win reelection with everyone against me! I made those posts long ago; they don't reflect my current politics! I mean sure, they're a bit racist and moderately sexist, and there's a couple of tasteless jokes about the disabled... and I may have said something about a university club initiation ceremony and a pig's mouth, but if I issue a public apology and act as if I actually mean it, then you can come out in support of me again. It will be like nothing ever happened!"

2. "We can't associate with this toxic lost cause," mutters your chief spin doctor, ushering @@LASTNAME_1@@ out of the room. "However, we need to make sure nothing like this ever happens to us again. I mean, which of us can say that our online history is spotless? We need legislation protecting the 'right to be forgotten', with individuals â€” and more importantly the government â€” able to force ISPs, news websites and social media to delete data after a certain amount of time, or at an individual's request, and with the ability to prosecute those who show or reference censored history.

3. "Everyone must be held responsible for everything they say, no matter how long ago they said it!" yells journalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, bursting from @@HIS@@ hiding place behind an oversized yucca plant. "It's despicable that someone can get away with such nasty comments, which probably reveal someone's true beliefs better than the carefully managed statements and speeches they've made in adult life!

One of the longest rivers in @@NAME@@ is also a major shipping lane in @@REGION@@. Bigtopia, a downstream nation, has unveiled its plans to dam this river, prohibiting any ships from travelling further upstream and beyond its waters.

The Debate
1. "Bigtopia obviously has some problems that it's trying to address by constructing a dam," points out your Minister for Solutions, Revo Gnidneb. "Let's offer the Bigtopians solutions to their problems so that they won't have to build anything. I heard they want a dam to generate power. Let's just sell them lots of cheap electricity. Maybe the Bigtopians want a dam to supply themselves with water. @@NAME@@ can supply them with water instead. Whatever it takes to change their minds, let's do it! It'll be worth it if our trade routes remain open."

2. "The lifeblood of my people is at stake!" cries the ambassador from an upstream landlocked country. "My country's only access to the sea is through that river! If that damned dam gets built, cargo ships would be unable to travel to and from my nation! Bigtopia won't listen to our pleas. What do you say we and the other upstream countries gather an army and blow those asshats out of the water?"

3. "Oh, cry me a river," advises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a civil engineer, whilst pulling out a map. "We can just build a new canal connecting our portion of the river to the sea." He draws on the map with a marker. "This could be the route. If we give grants to nearby inland towns, they could expand out to the banks of the canal and become port cities!

1. "Think about how many @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ can be made!" enthuses concert promoter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, handing out Jack Michaelson memorabilia to your staff. "Jack Michaelson is still one of the most popular musicians in @@NAME@@ despite his unfortunate death.

"Look, I'm just trying to make a living here. Do you know how difficult it is when these kids are posting how insensitive my jokes are all over social media?

The Issue
[i]Occam's Eleven[/i], a sensational and skillful group of international artifact thieves, have been making the headlines after a series of successful heists. Rumours and international police investigations suggest that their next target is the Crown Jewels of @@NAME@@!

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, it's time that you recognised that our national treasures should be under lock and key, protected by heavy security," insists @@CAPITAL@@ Chief of Police @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Dreyfus. "Precious artifacts like these royal heirlooms shouldn't be on public display where they are vulnerable, but should be placed in secure hidden locations. So rest assured, if you put the law in charge of this matter, we'll stop the heists and bust these ghosts."

2. "Regular cops aren't enough to catch thieves like these," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a high-level official with the Ministry of Expensive Solutions. "It's time to broadcast an SOS to the finest freelance detectives in the world, by offering a reward for the capture of the most notorious criminals. Maybe we'll attract Hermione Clouseau, who solved the Crimson Cougar Diamond mystery! Or maybe we'll get infamous bounty hunter Bobbi Feta on the case. Either way, we're going to need the very best to catch crooks like these!"

3. "Expensive things are always going to be targeted by thieves; what we need to do is remove the temptation," suggests your Minister for the Treasury. "Fabricate cheap petrochemical carbon-copies of the Crown Jewels for the royals to wear, and sell off the originals for the Treasury's benefit. No thief is going to bother stealing worthless replicas."

4. "You're right that we can't be stopped," interrupts Billy 'Razor' Occam, the master criminal's handsome face appearing on a widescreen wall monitor as he transmits to you from a beach in Manamana. "But honestly, we don't need the crown, so let's cut a deal. The, uh, extended family and I have always wanted to take an unsupervised tour of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Bullion Depository, Fort Rocks. I'll call off the heist if you let us take a look around."

[b][anchor=1075]#1075[/anchor]: The Hand That Feeds [Gnejs; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
The all but non-existent agricultural sector of @@NATION@@ has concerned your policy advisors for some time. The nation's great reliance on food imports is viewed as a major risk, due to the real possibility of your trading partners deciding to withhold much-needed imports as leverage to extract economic and political gains. The problem has been thrust to the top of your agenda after a high-profile public disagreement left a Bigtopian attachÃ© making less than thinly veiled threats about cancelled shipments.

The Debate
1. "We can no longer depend on foreign nations for our food; it's too dangerous," warns one of your senior advisors. "We desperately need to aim for complete self-sufficiency. Let's revitalise our domestic food production and immediately allocate government land for farming purposes! We'll need a lot of labour. I suggest that the able-bodied adult population be randomly divided into several groups, with the duty of working on the farms rotating among the groups each year. Heavily fine those who don't comply. Folks won't be happy about it, but this is necessary for our survival. We currently grow none of the food we eat!"

2*. "Yeah, that sounds great and all, except for the part where you expect me to go farming," complains your secretary while undergoing an extensive pedicure program. "Why can't you let in some of those weird refugees that are just hanging around the border? They could do the farming for us! They already smell, and I'm sure they'll be glad of the work!" [[color=blue]Must allow Immigration[/color]]

[[color=red]Must not allow Immigration[/color]]

4. "I don't wanna use the word, but I'll just say that Bigtopia is taking advantage of us," rasps the thick industrialist Edward Rump. "When was the last time anybody saw us beating them in a trade deal? With Bigtopia, we are losing 500 bazillion @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ a year. We tax them practically nothing. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna charge a tariff on the food they bring in until such time as they straighten out their act and behave properly. Bigtopia is but one of our sources for food, and we'll just take our money elsewhere if they don't play fair. And it's all gonna work out; it's all gonna work out. Remember this, remember this â€” it's all gonna work out."

5. "We obviously can't leave ourselves to the mercy of our trading partners," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, yet another one of your trusted advisors. "But turning all of @@NATION@@ into a vegetable garden and forcing people to tend it sounds like something the Khmer Bleu of Marche Noire would do! Let's just provide some really generous incentives for potential farmers, all while maintaining our import quotas. We can tweak them every year. If we just keep this system up long enough, we'll strike a balance eventually. Some say you can't have it all, but we're going to make a cake and eat it too!"

[b][anchor=1076]#1076[/anchor]: Smokers Cornered [Lancaster of Wessex; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
Despite widespread public awareness about the dangers of smoking, the habit still continues among a sizeable portion of the population. Shady looking teenagers, stressed-out office workers, and chatterbox seniors can still be seen puffing away.

The Debate
1. "There's no better way to end this filthy habit once and for all than by hitting smokers where it hurts: no, not their lungs, but their wallets!" reflects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Health and Ruining Fun, whilst crunching on a celery stick. "Making ciggies punitively expensive with enforced minimum pricing will make most smokers think twice before they buy their next pack and will have them abandoning this habit before you can say 'cough'!" 

2. "Um, if I may be so bold as to make a suggestion @@LEADER@@," enquires @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your office cleaner, as @@HE@@ briefly stops polishing your photo frame. "Cigarettes are one of the few pleasures the poorer members of society have. I beg you to find it within your heart to make smokes as inexpensive as possible."

3. "By Jove, old sport, I have a smashing plan," wheezes rotund blue-blood Charles Uppington-Noseworthy. "The government should prohibit cigarettes, while permitting only the more dignified forms of tobacco: cigars, pipes, and snuff - but please - avoid the hideous levies on them. Just think about it: chaps would finally be gentlemen again, and the air would be rich with scents of spice, cedar and carcinogens! As for the ladies - well, they should not partake in smoking; 'tis not becoming of the fairer sex."

4. "This has to be the most disgusting habit ever," opines ex-smoker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a heavily chewed pencil at you. "Cancer, lung disease, heart disease, financial costs. There is nothing good about smoking, nothing. I'm totally glad I quit and I so don't follow smokers around to inhale their second-hand fumes. You need to ban all forms of tobacco now! Get that temptation away from me... I mean, for everyone's health!"

[b][anchor=1077]#1077[/anchor]: With Friends Like These... [Sacara; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A TV network recently aired a rerun of [i]Enemies[/i], a popular television series from twenty-five years ago. However, the humor has dated badly, and many of the jokes are now being seen as transphobic, homophobic, bigoted, and racist.

The Debate
1. "My eyes!" screeches your niece, obviously distressed and trembling with shock. "How did anyone ever find this funny? It's just sick, absolutely sick. Like that one episode when they pejoratively used the appellation 'gay' to describe someone who was being emotionally vulnerable? Disgusting! You've got to ban re-runs of bigoted shows like this once and for all, so no one else will have to endure these offensive horrors!"

2. "Hey, what's the dealo?" questions Ross @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, one of the stars of the show in question. "This is classic comedy, man. I mean, you couldn't get away with saying half the stuff that we did, but you'd be destroying a national masterpiece. We need to keep this to teach people what @@NAME@@ used to be like. Keep the history, man, don't ever be censoring entertainment!"

3. "Heh, have I got a solution for you," mutters your bored-looking Minister of Propaganda, twiddling @@HIS@@ thumbs absent-mindedly. "My ministry will take control of producing content that will both be inoffensive and pro-government. While we're at it, give us control of news media too. We will control the horizontal. We will control the vertical."

4. "For Violet's sake, the average @@DEMONYM@@ has gotten far too soft," comments one of your brothers, looking at your niece with disgust. "We need to educate them to have thicker skin and take a joke or two, no matter how crude. How about we add a class or two in our education system that'll teach 'em how to handle some humor?"

[b][anchor=1078]#1078[/anchor]: Down With That? [Sacara; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
A @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ cruise ship ran aground last week in the treacherous waters off the southern coast. The captain, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, had infamy bestowed upon @@HIM_1@@ after it was found that @@HE_1@@ abandoned ship before all of the passengers on board safely made it off, defying centuries of maritime tradition.

The Debate
1. "Twenty people drowned in that accident, and that scum-bag decided @@HIS_1@@ life was more important?" rhetorically asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the surviving passengers of the ship, still visibly shaken by what had occurred. "Ship captains should always see to it that everyone on board gets off safely before they do â€“ after all, they can't direct the rescue effort if they aren't on the actual ship! If they don't, we must punish these cowards to the fullest extent of the law!"

2. "Let's not be too hasty about assigning blame here!" counters Captain @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, who's remarkably shorter and skinnier than you expected @@HIM_1@@ to be. "I'm just as traumatized as anyone else. I was actually helping coordinate the rescue operation, albeit from the safety of land. It's not my duty to add to the death toll, is it?"

3. "That captain is nothing but a lily-livered land-lubber!" scoffs Rear Admiral @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "When @@NAME@@ first took to the seas, the ship's captain was obliged to go down with the ship, even if they were within spitting distance of the shore! It was the honourable thing to do back then. We should return to our maritime traditions and any captain that doesn't like it should be given a good ol' keel-hauling!"

[b][anchor=1079]#1079[/anchor]: What's Love Got to Do With It? [The Free Joy State; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
When you walk into your office, you see Bart, your personal secretary, in a passionate â€” and completely illegal â€” clinch with @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@, your other brother.

The Debate
1. "Yes, Bart and I are in love," sighs @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_1@@, as your personal secretary straightens his tie and smooths his hair. "We've been meeting in secret for three years now. It's been difficult, and I've hated hiding it from you. I so wanted to tell my favourite sibling that I met a wonderful human being: intelligent, articulate, caring... but because of the law, I didn't dare. Isn't it time to change that law? Do you know how it feels, to be unable to walk down the street with your sweetheart or even buy a Violetine's Day card without being harassed? Wouldn't it be just fabulous if we could have the same rights as heterosexual couples?"

2. "Of course they kept it a secret," barks your traditionalist Minister of the Interior, as he slams his riding crop repeatedly against his own thigh with unusual pink-cheeked glee. "Because they're nothing but a pair of sodomites. 'Love'? Pah! They are no more capable of such wholesome emotion than a pair of orang-utans. And what do we do when we want an animal to cease rutting? We neuter them. All sexual inverts, regardless of gender or social position, must be taken to a medical centre and doctored, so they are incapable of feeling lascivious lusts." With a long sigh, he finally brings the crop to rest.

*3. "That seems awfully... draconian," muses @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your Minister of Public Schools, whose fifteen year marriage is childless. "I was just saying to my wife Alex â€” she's busy at the forge today: who doesn't go through a phase in their younger years? It's expected for a young man or woman to have a very close chum, with whom they tousle, and cuddle and even snog a bit. So I hear. @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@ will grow out of it. There's no call for any, shall we say, unpleasantness. Just encourage weddings with a pro-marriage campaign, a matchmaking service specifically for those with close same-sex friends seeking simpatico spouses, and a monetary gift to newly-wed couples. He'll soon find a nice gal, and forget all about @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@... erm, Bart." [[color=blue]Marriage is legal[/color]]
