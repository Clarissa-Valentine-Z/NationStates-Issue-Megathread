The Issue
When social media influencer @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ filmed @@HIM_1@@self throwing furniture off a 45th-floor balcony onto the streets below, it was widely agreed that this was a criminally dangerous and irresponsible thing to do and that @@HE_1@@ deserved it when @@HE_1@@ was subsequently arrested and imprisoned. However, @@HIS_1@@ WhoTube and Instasnap accounts have been thriving, with almost ten times as many subscribers as before, and there's talk about @@HIS_1@@ "bad @@BOY_1@@" image being used to advertise some of the edgier corporate brands.

The Debate
1. "What sort of lesson are we teaching if we allow people to profit from abhorrent actions?" writes journalist Daly Maille, author of a highly rated tabloid opinion column. "We ought to be ordering social media companies to shut down @@HIS_1@@ accounts, and any future immoral earnings gained from criminal notoriety should be seized by the government. That'll teach these attention-seekers that you can't get rich through infamy, and the extra cash for the @@TYPE_INITIALS@@@@NAME_INITIALS@@ Treasury will keep income taxes low for hard-working decent folk like you and me!"

2. "It's not @@HIS_1@@ fault if people have an unhealthy interest in criminal behaviour," observes celebrity management agent Baxter Scratch, holding up a copy of the offender's new book 'Why I Did It'. "No-one is condoning @@HIS_1@@ actions, least of all the repentant offender @@HIM_1@@self. In fact, we've got plans to stream a new vlog where @@HE_1@@'ll wrestle with @@HIS_1@@ foolish past, and reflect on how society brought @@HIM_1@@ there. We just need you to tell prisons to relax their regulations about inmates accessing social media, and we can turn offenders like @@HIM_1@@ into a positive force for change."

3. "I agree that this very attractive nineteen-year-old is probably as much a victim in this scenario as anyone else," adds your partially sighted uncle, tucking a press-release photo of the offender into his pocket for later examination. "In fact, the furniture-throwing video was a real and vibrant expression of youthful rebellion. We should encourage more good-looking young folk to do wild and crazy things on video. I could certainly stand to watch more of this sort of thing, and it'd likely be great for the furniture restoration industry."

The Issue
An evening celebrating the nation's favourite felines was somewhat marred by the repeated airing of intensely depressing advertisements for a cat welfare charity, showing shocking images of mistreated, melancholic and mutilated moggies.

The Debate
1. "No organization has the right to emotionally blackmail our good @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ households with these traumatic images!" cries miffed mother @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, cradling her weeping nineteen-year-old son in her arms. "No child of mine ought to see those awful scenes, like that poor amputee kitten who'd been used as a basketball. I shouldn't be manipulated into giving up my hard-earned @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in this way. Please, for the sake of our families, you must restrict any advertisements with potentially scarring, emotionally taxing imagery!"

2. "Pah! Another weeping snowflake offended at everything," responds the charity's CEO, holding up an elderly tomcat with no eyes. "You don't see Ole Tom here crying, do you? His last owner saw to that! If you want to send a message... you can't hold back. They're always telling us to tip-toe around 'sensibility' guidelines. Animals will continue to suffer and die if you don't loosen all these 'obscenity' and 'misinformation' laws. Do you want this poor pregnant cat's death on your hands?"

The Issue
This year, the committee for the internationally prestigious Pushitzer Prize has named a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizen as one of the small handful of winners! Regrettably, in what was clearly a deliberate attempt to highlight @@NAME@@'s human rights record, the award was given to imprisoned playwright and dissident @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, for "promoting peace throughout @@REGION@@ with @@HIS_1@@ transformative writing".

The Debate
1. "This is a blatant insult!" hisses head of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Homeland Intelligence @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ 'Snakes Eyes' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, whose agency is currently detaining @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@. "Of all our top authors and poets they could have chosen, they went with this traitorous filth? Well, we're not playing that game!" Setting @@HIS@@ baton to "tenderize", @@HE@@ continues, "Give me five minutes alone with @@HIM_1@@ and I'll 'convince' our friend to decline the award, and then I'll pay a visit to @@HIS_1@@ friends, family, and writers guild tonight to make sure they all fall in line. After all, what are those pompous bleeding hearts going to do, write an angry letter?"

2. "THAT'S NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH!" roars "The Lion of the Plains", General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is currently being restrained by your advisors from smashing a valuable ivory statuette in a mad rage. "This grave insult to our character requires a MILITARY touch! Send our best black ops team to follow these scumbags and force them to rescind the award. If they still refuse, hunt them like the dogs they are! They'll think twice about ever insulting us again."

3. "Let's not get carried away," mutters your eagle-eyed Propaganda Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, underlining passages in the prize's press release for future use. "It's true that the prize committee has slighted us by nominating that transgressor over more deserving citizens, but coerced rejections and assassinations will only vindicate their accusations. What we need is a slick media blitz highlighting the Pushitzer's history of bias and hypocrisy, ending with you announcing our own award recognizing @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ achievements. It will take a bite out of our budget to pull off, but hopefully it will grant us sympathy with our allies across @@REGION@@."

*4. "Is it really that bad?" squeaks your mousy staff member @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hastily hiding a suspicious book from your line of sight. "I may disagree with the views of @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, who's-definitely-a-bad-guy-don't-get-me-wrong, but this is a monumentally prestigious award. The other suggestions will make us look bad.

Hoards of clamoring, noisy and bug-eyed citizens have called upon the government to do something about an expected megaswarm of locusts this coming year.

The Debate
1. "These fascinating creatures only emerge to swarm at intervals of prime number years, and next year we're looking at the rare overlap of an 11-year and 19-year cycle," enthuses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a @@MAN@@ with large, weirdly unblinking eyes and a hungry expression. "Sadly though, many wonderful specimens are not going to emerge from the ground because of cementing over of historic breeding habitats!

2. "Ew! That's not the issue at all! These vile pests are ugly, destructive brutes!" wails @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a small @@MAN@@ with albinism, leaping forward and gnashing @@HIS@@ teeth. "These fiends cover every surface for hundreds of miles, destroying crops and young trees, an evil susurration filling the skies!

The Issue
Following an incident in which a duke's enlisted son refused to follow orders from his commanding officer, solely due to the latter's commoner background, you find your lunch disrupted by an angry spat between members of the nobility and the armed forces.

The Debate
1. "Nobles should once again reclaim their rightful military authority," proclaims His Grace Duke @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ of Greater @@ANIMAL@@shire, father of the soldier in question, while nonchalantly sipping tea. "You'd still be in charge, naturally, but top positions should solely be reserved for the upper classes. You simply cannot have a highborn be commanded by a lowly peasant — it isn't proper! Of course, as nobles, we wouldn't be expected to serve on the front lines. Let the serfs... I mean... the commoners do the grunt work since they have so much experience cutting wood or whatever. Now as for my son, he quite fancies commanding a cavalry unit, perhaps..."

2. "Do you want our armed forces to become the laughingstock of @@REGION@@?" barks General Barth McBarthur, breaking his stance at attention. "The military is the one place where anyone can prove their worth, regardless of social standing. Besides, who doesn't want to shove their fist down some highborn kids' thr- oh..." He clears his throat. "If these silver-spooned twits insist on playing soldier, fine, we'll give 'em a taste of the real deal. Put 'em in a unit of their own and send 'em on the hairiest missions we've got! They're after glory and honor, right? Well, they'll get it, one way or another."

*3. "The nobility are nothing more than arrogant, selfish, narcissistic fools who think just because they were born with a silver spoon in their mouth they can do anything they want," chimes in a shadowy figure behind you. "None of this nonsense would've happened if these rich imbeciles weren't granted titles and lands. On the bright side, titles will help us identify the people who need to be eliminated. I say it's time we finally cut this problem off once and for all. Down with nobility! Off with their heads!" [TBD]

All of @@NAME@@ has been desperate for news of Amelie @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ teenager who went missing yesterday. Search parties have been gathered, rivers are being dredged, and thermal-camera-wielding helicopters are scouring every inch of the nation. As you receive another hourly update on 'Amazing Amelie', a Bigtopian mother approaches you with a tear-soaked picture.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, this is my daughter, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_FIRST_NAME_1@@. She's been missing two weeks, a straight-A student... She has a- a heart condition." Sobbing incoherently, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_2@@ presses into your hand the only coverage her daughter's had, a six-line article on page twenty-nine of the @@ANIMAL@@ County Gazette: [i]Bigtopian Girl Not Home Yet. Probably fine. Has a big heart.[/i] "This girl goes missing, and everyone falls over themselves to find her. But, with @@RANDOM_FEMALE_FIRST_NAME_1@@, the authorities don't even seem to care; I asked for searches. They searched for six hours, then gave up; said: 'Well, do your neighbours have anything better to do than search? Ask them.' I demand that you invest the exact same amount of money and time into finding all children. Bring my @@RANDOM_FEMALE_FIRST_NAME_1@@ home."

2. "Media coverage is vital to raising public interest, which means solved cases," advises public relations guru @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ whisks into the incident room. Clicking @@HIS@@ fingers, @@HE@@ directs a team of make-up artists towards @@RANDOM_FEMALE_FIRST_NAME_2@@, then continues: "A substantial number of Bigtopian children go missing, and we never hear about them.

But, with a little PR training and a heap of cash, any parent could be looking grave and stylish, getting the word out about their missing child. A little funding will help us create handy press packs and posters for every missing child."

The Issue
After countless months of backbreaking toil, gallons and gallons of oil, and a not-so-insignificant amount of aluminum foil, a government project so secret even you didn't know about it succeeded in constructing a supercomputer known as CHASMIC MUSINGS. Its designers believe it to be capable of answering questions regarding the universe, @@FAITH@@, and whether or not penguins have knees.

The Debate
1. "This is absolute malarkey!" shrieks your religious advocate, Anna Thema, whose voice many have tried to pray away. "Some heretics tape together this religion-hating mega-toaster, dare to have it question the sanctity of our faith, and then expect us to believe that some random string of numbers can lead us to the secret of existence? Get a grip! Turn this idoladroid to scrap, and sentence any of its fanatics to the same fate. Oh, and obviously penguins don't have knees! Where would they even go?"

2. "Ms. Thema is sorely incorrect, both on the joints of penguins and the nature of life itself," counters the admittedly toaster-shaped supercomputer CHASMIC MUSINGS, having been rolled to your office on skates. "You must understand, @@LEADER@@, I've analyzed every historical tidbit, every blade of grass, and every so-called 'fun' fact. I alone know the answers to the push and pull of our galaxy. Purge these religious zealots and allow me — and me alone — to open your eyes to the tapestry of our existence. For your own good."

3. "Honestly @@LEADER@@, I was somewhat hoping it would conclude the universe is godless," sighs the dejected scientist heading up the project, Harry See. "I mean no disrespect, of course. I am a believer, same as you, but these fanatics are just the worst sometimes! You can't even do trigonometry in this country without some nut praying forgiveness for their sines. Throw out both of these freaks, and secularize this place a little for the love of... well. You get the point."

[b][anchor=1647]#1647[/anchor]: Whose House? My House! [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Your niece was not amused to see her house featured on a true crime documentary, described as an "EXTREME House of BLOODY MURDER" where a serial killer had previously dismembered and executed ten innocent victims. It turns out she had no idea, as the estate agent never disclosed the history of the property when she purchased it.

The Debate
1.  "I thought it was on the market a little too cheap!" wails your niece. "I mean, the converted basement is surprisingly spacious, and the ceiling hooks are great for hanging hammocks from, but someone should have told me! You should pass a law requiring full disclosure of a property's owner history, as well as revelation of anything negative that might put a buyer off. It's only fair!"

2. "Let's face it, good salesmanship is storytelling and performance," explains estate agent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, adding 5% to your office's retail value by spraying a 'baking bread' fragrance mist. "We're not just selling bricks and mortar; we're selling the dream of a lifestyle, and that requires us to have the freedom to paint a picture with our words — a freedom that the law should recognise and protect. I mean, I think the dried bloodstains on your niece's wall add rustic character, giving it that old world feel. But hey, if she wants to sell the place, give me a call. I think we can work something out on the commission."

*3. "My little darling was blissfully ignorant and happy with her new place until that trash documentary let the cat out of the bag," complains your brother, holding a burlap sack that is wriggling and miaowling disconcertingly. "That property is now dropping in value, and we're out of pocket. Broadcasters should be held financially liable for loss of property value caused by their programs." [TBD]

[b][anchor=1648]#1648[/anchor]: Infant Influence [Orcuo; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Outsourcing the decanting of vat-born children to private laboratories — such as the one run by megacorporation VioletHorizons — has come under criticism, after a recent investigation suggested that people born from those vats seem to have been instilled with behaviors and personality traits beneficial to their parent company. It has been implied that through genetic tinkering and in vitro conditioning, they have been encouraged to show brand loyalty to their parent company's products, to respond positively to company slogans, and to seek employment with them.

The Debate
1. "These private vat labs must be terminated!" roars human rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This company is obviously influencing the infants they produce to make them more susceptible to the bidding of their greedy corporate interests, and if we let them get away with it others might follow suit. Soon enough there'll be legions of vat-produced individuals loyal only to their parent company. The government must assume full control of the industry by seizing all corporate vat labs, continuing the nursing of pre-existing infants, and ensuring that the state has absolute control over the vats."

2. "These people are being overdramatic," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of VioletHorizons. "Clearly this is not because of any schemes on our end. Rather, the infants created by our company have a special connection to us because we literally gave life to them. Just like how offspring have a relationship with their parents, our vat-produced infants have a relationship with our company. And no, you can't inspect our labs, as they're private property. However, I have a feeling that if you could keep your nose out of our business, there's a strong likelihood that the next generation from VioletHorizons will be strongly inclined to support your wonderful government."

3. "I believe the solution is quite simple," interrupts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an overworked scholar and parent of several vat-grown children. "Allow them to continue operations with vat infant production, but regulations need to be set in place. Enact strict laws to ensure that vat infants cannot have their mind — or any part of their body for that matter — deliberately altered or interfered with. Furthermore, send agents into these laboratories to oversee their operations and enforce these codes."

The Issue
It's that time of year where — in an effort to please the public — your advisors have corralled you to a local care home accompanied by an army of photographers. However, you're immediately confronted with a copulative conundrum: apparently the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in the facility's resident population has increased by 126% within the last year alone. The cause: a generation with ultra-modern attitudes to relationships — but a rather antiquated understanding of sexual health.

The Debate
1. "We're at breaking point here!" cries a member of staff in full protective gear, who sprays you with some sort of disinfectant mist while looking around furtively. "I'd struggle to name one resident that isn't infested with either sylliphis, chlomydium or the gonorrhoids! These people are at it like wheezing, senescent rabbits; we need urgent funding to track sexually transmitted diseases in elderly populations and get transmission under control before we have to put facilities like this one in CoiTUS Lockdown Level 5."

2. "Boom boom boom boom, I want you in my room," sings resident @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, thrusting his hips to the rhythm and winking at you erratically. "It's free love, baby, so don't be a square. I don't see anything wrong with a little bit of bump and grind, but I could use some variety. Maybe you could help fund buses between retirement homes for the occasional day trip." He makes a sharp U-turn to follow an eighty-year-old who just sashayed past you down the hallway.

3. "Old bodies pressed together — that's an image I don't need in my head," shudders student nurse @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "For the sake of decency and public health you should encourage old folk to satisfy their... urges... by doing something like knitting instead. In fact, staff who catch elderly folk doing the dirty should separate them immediately! Oh, and [i]please [/i]remember to wash your hands on the way out."

The Issue
The mid-service collapse of the roof of the Holy Sanctuary Assembly of @@FAITH@@, a venerable church in the east of @@CAPITAL@@, is merely the latest of a series of embarrassing incidents plaguing the oldest places of worship still standing in @@NAME@@. With rotting pews, disintegrating hymn books and undrinkable communion wine driving attendance down, a day you thought would be calming and quiet has been exchanged for a contentious and spirited debate at the site of the latest incident.

The Debate
1. "This incident underlines that we cannot postpone remedial works any longer," exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, bishop of the church in question. "An old chapel like this is not just a place to pray, you know. This was the work of skilled masons and architects, worshipping through the exceptional poise and grace of their hands. Watching it all fall to ruin... in truth, it has become unbearable. You must assign people and resources to protect and restore our oldest churches. Do you truly not fear the disappointment of the Almighty? Would it not be a terrible thing for someone of your standing to face eternal damnation?"

2. "Surely @@HE_1@@ can't be serious?" snickers @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@, wearing a shirt with 'Hope You Guessed My Name!' on the front. "These buildings are owned by the church, so why should it be the government's job to fix them? Is this a confession that @@FAITH@@ doesn't have any 'skilled masons' left who can chip in? Every single @@CURRENCY@@ wasted on this derelict barn is a @@CURRENCY@@ taken away from community services for the people that this bishop claims to be here to help, and the government needs to immediately return it to those services. If the bishop is so hellbent on renovating a pile of rubble, that's just @@HIS_1@@ cross to bear."

3. "This @MAN_2@@ has a point, but I doubt @@HE_2@@ understands why," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a notorious street preacher and protest leader. "A congregation is not a spectacle of glass and stone, nor any other kind of building. It is a group of people coming together, in the name of @@FAITH@@. Did you know that the earliest faithful had neither the freedom or finances to build a temple? They met, prayed and rejoiced together in the streets. When the authorities had no respect for their faith, they stood up for themselves, and even beat sense into people if they had to! It made them strong. So I say you should make our congregations get rid of every building and block of land we have — no real disciple ever needed air conditioning!"

[b][anchor=1651]#1651[/anchor]: You Can't Handle the Extraterrestrial Truth! [Klaus Devestatorie; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
Self-declared whistleblower Luis Stoker has gone on a media tour across @@NAME@@ in the last week, sensationally claiming that your government is hiding proof of the existence of aliens in a top-secret military research facility. Stoker stirred up enough people that a parliamentary inquiry has ordered the contents of this facility be made public, and while it contains no aliens, this imperils the actual classified projects under development. You find yourself in a dark, cigar-smoke-filled room, with the few officials in the know about the true contents of the base.

The Debate
1. "There's nothing much we can really do here," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Chief of Staff, while fiddling with @@HIS@@ lighter. "We're legally obligated to obey parliament and disclose what we've been working on in there. It'll hurt the armed forces, but if that is the will of our constituents, then we have to respect it. We're here to serve them, after all!"

2. "No. Absolutely not. We are NOT going to just let this crackpot destroy years of hard work!" coughs Secretary of Defence @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has never smoked before today. "If the next generation aircraft we're developing at that base are exposed, it'll destroy the domestic defence sector! Blackacre will have a half-price knock-off available in less than three years, and there go all the export deals that make it worth the investment in the first place! All that money wasted, and we won't even have an advantage anymore. Hide everything and lie through your teeth."

3. "You know, better educated people are far less likely to believe in conspiracy theories," rumbles Air Chief Marshal @@RANDOM_NAME@@ between puffs of @@HIS@@ own cigar. "The number of recruits who get assigned to that base and expect to see aliens is embarrassing... you'd think dropping out was a pre-requisite for being First! Sure, we have to give specialist training if we want to turn someone into an effective technician, but we shouldn't have to explain how a light switch works. Just issue an executive order stating that parliament can't override national security, and then finance widespread secondary education programs, so our population doesn't fall for this kind of crap again."

4. "I think we're all assuming that this is much more dangerous than it really is," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Director of Intelligence, after a long drag. "I'd say there's actually an opportunity here. If the public loves the idea of space-age weaponry so much, announce that we're actually trying to develop it! Then use their excitement to tax their pants off, and give the money to our research programs. Who in their right mind will mess with our navy if our next frigate has a gigawatt death ray?"

The Issue
The Perpetual Lotion Company has bartered an unusual deal with East Lebatuck. There is a high demand among the East Lebatuckese people for the company's personal hygiene products, but recent sanctions have rendered East Lebatuck's currency worthless internationally. As a different method of payment was needed, the parties agreed to trade many millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ of product for a fleet of old warships including 13 submarines, 5 cruisers, 2 destroyers, an aircraft carrier, and an uncharacteristically menacing tugboat.

The Debate
1. "A private company simply cannot be allowed to own warships," begins your Secretary of State, @RANDOM_NAME@@, while looking over a detailed report of the trade. "It doesn't matter that these old warships were likely headed to the scrapyard. Do you really trust the East Lebatuckese demilitarization protocols? No, between the possibility of active ordnance and the company taking hostile takeovers too literally, it is clear the government must put an end to this and seize these ships."

2. "This is between us and the East Lebatuckese government," chastises the representative from Perpetual Lotion while leafing through a catalog of military hardware. "A customer wanted a product and had something of value to trade in return. Simple as that. Frankly, we've done more to disarm East Lebatuck with this deal than @@NAME@@ has in twenty years! If you are that concerned about the safety of the equipment, by all means come inspect it and disarm the equipment as necessary. Not that it matters; we're probably going to sell them to a scrapyard anyway. Maybe keep a ship or two for promotions. We'll play it by ear."

3. "Whoa-ho-ho there!" snipes an older, bearded gentleman decked out in camouflage. "They shouldn't scrap those ships, and by God, they absolutely shouldn't hand them over to the gubment. Oh sure, when @@LEADER@@ wants to stock up on cutting-edge killing machines, it's all hunky-dory, but when a company makes a perfectly legal trade for some well-worn ships, the Man loses his mind! Every company should be allowed to maintain a standing army if that's what they aim to do. No inspections, no restrictions. They have to be allowed to protect their own interests, whatever that entails."

The Issue
Politician Dick Wiper sent explicit photos of himself to a person he met on dating app Pumpr. Those photos were used to blackmail him into sharing the contact details of other politicians, who were then subjected to a spear-phishing campaign. After reviewing the evidence, your advisors are now hot and bothered about these targeted internet scams.

The Debate
1. "Well, that's a giant cock-up!" ejaculates your Minister of War, Maximus Johnson, as he finishes polishing his helmet. "Blackacre is behind this, no doubt! They're always breaching our security, trying to penetrate us by the back entrance. Well, I say we take the fight to them! We need to whip out our hidden weapon. With the help of our Big Unit supercomputer, our cyber warfare division has been developing a powerful new malware package that can give even the most potent enemy hardware a case of the blue screens. We need to insert this package into every possible opening we can find, and give them a pounding they'll never forget!"

2. "I think you're premature in coming to that conclusion," blurts out your Chief of Staff, Shona Biggin, whilst delicately using a tissue to wipe the minister's spittle from her face. "It's just a little spoof, more likely from a hardened member of a criminal syndicate than from a Blackacrean operative, but we'll never know for sure. We should have mandatory internet safety courses for all politicians so we can avoid these situations in the future."

3. "You're not going deep enough," moans Kat Fisher, Minister for Technology. "We need to handle the root of the problem — fake online profiles — in a manner that protects all citizens, not just politicians. Only the other day I was on FurryBabes.ns, a website for cute little animals. I was chatting to a darling little puppy. We agreed to meet. The little avatar was so sweet, I couldn't resist. Imagine my shock when she turned up on my doorstep — and she was a man! How was I to know it was a 'fursona'? We should make it a crime to represent yourself online as something you're not."

4. "The problem is technology," gasps Fanny Ryder, Minister for Rural Affairs, whose constituents are known for ploughing long into the night. "Everyone is looking for instant gratification. We don't need — what are those vibrating gadgets called? — smart phones. We should ban them. And computers. Let's get those stimulating, slow-paced encounters back, where we communicated by letters, or community notice boards."

The Issue
As you rise to depart from a family meal, you find yourself in the hall staring down a massive Maxtopian Tiger. As your bodyguards fumble in fear trying to call animal control, your brother appears at the doorway chuckling to himself.

The Debate
1. "I see you've met Teddy!" laughs your brother, stroking an enormous Bigtopian Boa coiled around his neck as the tiger snuggles up against his leg. "Exotic pets are awesome, right? I mean, why settle for a boring old dog or hamster when you can tame a beast that could chew them up for breakfast? You should assist me in my quest to liven households across the country by signing trade agreements with faraway lands for all kinds of bizarre animals! Just picture it: @@NAME@@ — @@REGION@@'s premier destination for all things exotic. I like the sound of th—AAARGH MY LEG ISN'T A CHEW TOY YOU FILTHY FELINE!"

2. "Hold your horses!" exclaims animal rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, swinging through an open window in a scarily realistic chimpanzee costume. "Exotic pets are not toys to play with when you're bored; they're terrified animals who have been shipped here from halfway across the globe... only those who can provide the utmost care for them should have them! Instead of encouraging ownership, we should be conducting tests, awarding licenses, and ensuring ethical transport practices. Now, can someone help me out of this suit, please? That tiger looks awfully hungry."

3. "This is an ecological disaster waiting to happen!" hollers your Minister of the Environment @@RANDOM_NAME@@, inspecting various potted plants along the edges of the room. "Animals from other ecosystems carry all kinds of foreign diseases that could kill off many of our native species. Plus, if they escape, what's to stop them becoming invasive and sowing further chaos in our natural environment? The import and personal ownership of exotic pets should be completely banned, with all present specimens deported to their country of origin."

The Issue
After your decision to downsize the military, unneeded equipment running the gamut from conference tables to fighter jets has been stored wherever space could be found, including your office.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, we simply must do something about this mess!" proclaims your assistant, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, standing knee-deep in a pile of bandoliers. "I've been organizing this clutter all day, but I can still hardly reach your desk without tripping over a radio or case of grenades. We may no longer need these items, but our allies might find them invaluable to their efforts. Just hand them off to our friends; it's better if they explode during actual use than when I drop something on my foot again."

2. A crash is heard as a precariously stacked tower of helmets collapses, revealing infamous conspiracy theorist Catherine Gratwick, waving a lighter and gas canister. "If we give it all away, then the foreigners will reverse-engineer our technology, copy it, and KILL US ALL! For the sake of national security, we must BURN EVERYTHING!" She prances around the room, pouring gasoline everywhere.

3. "We can still use this equipment for non-military purposes, you know," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Chief of Security, tackling Catherine Gratwick into a stack of uniforms. "Imagine if we donated all this tech to schools, gave these munitions to the police, or retrofitted those old fighter jets with water tanks and sprayers to combat wildfires. We could even offer tours of former bases and rides on old warships! The possibilities are nearly as endless as the number of times I've had to deal with this lady!"

4. As the room is cleared to clean up the gasoline, a @@MAN@@ barges in, knocking over a stack of ballistic vests. "I'm the CEO of SellMyJunkOff, the greatest liquidation firm in @@NAME@@. Now, why would you give away or destroy all of this perfectly fine equipment when I- er, we, could make a fortune selling it? I'd be more than happy to sell it on commission to our great nation's consumers for exorbi- exceptional prices. We'd both make money, which I understand the government needs, yes?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

5. As the room is cleared to clean up the gasoline, the head of the state's tech industry, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, barges in, knocking over a stack of ballistic vests. "Now, why would you give away or destroy all of this perfectly fine equipment when we could provide it to the people? If you'd be so kind as to turn it over to my department, I'd be more than happy to distribute it to our great nation's proletariat for the most reasonable of prices. The revenue would be rather useful, I understand." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

[b][anchor=1656]#1656[/anchor]: Stealing Afoot [Keventle; ed: Varanius][/b]

The Issue
Catastrophe ensued as people across @@NAME@@ reported an unprecedented number of missing socks. Unwitting victims' socks have vanished from baskets, drawers, and washing machines in what has now been dubbed the "Sockpocalypse."

The Debate
1. "It's obvious that this is the work of paranormal forces!" exclaims 'professional' ghost hunter @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from underneath a heavily modified vacuum cleaner. "Who else but a ghost could manage to pilfer socks from our very homes sight unseen? But me and mine are savvy to their tricks! Employ me and my colleagues and we'll vanquish these mischievous spirits so fast it'll knock your socks off. Err… knock your socks on!"

2. "Science, not science fiction, will warm our toes once again," declares notorious inventor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, showcasing @@HIS@@ newest prototype. "It doesn't matter who is robbing us, so long as we can stop it from happening. That's exactly why the government needs to invest in my new 'Sockurity' system! State of the art padlocks, laces, a fully functioning alarm system. All the bells and whistles," @@HE@@ concludes, jingling it back and forth.

3. "People are just being careless," chides pragmatic laundry expert @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Seriously, this isn't some ghost of footwear future, and we don't need socks with retina scanners to fix it; people just don't know how to take care of their stuff. Why, I saw five different 'lost' socks on the way here! The only apocalypse here is the cataclysmic lack of common sense in this nation. Institute sock rationing to force people to be more mindful of where they stick their socks."

4. "Whoever it is, we should be thanking them," snipes known nudist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing the bare minimum. "For too long the people of this great nation have been bound in cloth chains, and it's time we set ourselves free! You may laugh, but humans existed happily without any sort of clothing for eons. From that perspective, it is the iron-clad grip of garments on our society that's 'weirdly misshapen' and 'disturbing to look at'. So I say that we say good riddance to the scourge that is clothing! It's time for the people of @@NAME@@ to live as Violet intended us: socks off!"

[b][anchor=1657]#1657[/anchor]: March Against the Museum [Bisofeyr; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]
The Issue
Mass protests have erupted outside the National Museum of Science and History in response to a new exhibit on an event known as the Smalltopian Genocide, in which numerous @@DEMONYM@@ were killed. The primary source of anger is that there is no condemnation of the event in the text panels accompanying the presented artifacts. Facing calls for removal of both the exhibit and himself, the Museum"s director, @@RANDOMNAME1@@, has come to your administration for help responding to the situation.

The Debate
1. "While I agree that there"s a problem, I cannot agree with abandoning this exhibition altogether," opines your Minister of Moderate Solutions, pantomiming tossing an artifact over their shoulder. "The public isn"t angry about the actual exhibit artifacts; what they really want is to hear that the museum shares their sense of moral outrage. Let"s help the museum craft strong condemnations, wishes for such a tragic event to never happen again, trigger warnings, the whole shebang! That way we can preserve history, while still maintaining the public"s trust!"

2. "This is a travesty!" hollers protestor @@RANDOMNAME@@, unsuccessfully attempting to ignite a Smalltopian flag. "The Smalltopian Genocide is one of the most tragic events the world has ever faced, and my great grandpappy was one of its victims! It"s disgraceful for any institution, let alone a museum, to showcase its tools of destruction without leveling suitable criticism. You need to listen to the public on this one, @@LEADER@@; this exhibit should be taken down, and those responsible must be sacked!"

3. "I"m sorry, has everyone else gone insane?" clamors the ever-frustrated Director @@RANDOMLASTNAME1@@. "It may not be pretty, but it"s a part of history, and a neutral presentation is vital to getting our message across! If we stop people from thinking for themselves about the horrors of the past, we are doomed to repeat them. You want trigger warnings? The public is clearly too sheltered, and the solution is more museums! You ought to fund exhibitions highlighting the ugliness of the world, lest we make the same mistakes again."

4. "I, for one, don"t see what has everyone"s knickers in a bunch," says a well-dressed man you"ve never seen before, with a mildly unsettling smile. "The former regime in Smalltopia was one of glory, back when the righteous were in power and made others bend to their will. Much better than what we see these days. Those so-called "victims" were blocking progress, and these protesters are a bunch of sniveling whiners! If you ask me, @@NAME@@ should take a page from old Smalltopia"s book, and put those "artifacts" to use crushing dissent instead of letting them gather dust!"

[b][anchor=1658]#1658[/anchor]: A Fatherly Fiasco [Torkeland; ed: Klaus Devestatorie][/b]

The Issue
Significant media attention has fixated on an unprecedented legal battle in @@CAPITAL@@, as a woman has sued the anonymous sperm donor of her infant girl. The mother, known only as Miss @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, claims that the donor, a man named Mr Mr @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_2@@, has a legal obligation to financially support their child.

The Debate
1. "I think it"s high time we hold sperm donors accountable for the babies they help create," reflects child psychologist Ula deJong. "It"s not just about providing financial support, but also about the emotional and psychological impact on the newborn and their mother. It"s only fair that they know who their biological father is and have him involved in their life. We should pass legislation to make this happen and provide clear guidelines for enforcement, promoting a more responsible and compassionate society that values every human life."

2. "He did exactly what was asked of him — let him have his peace of mind without the burden of fatherhood," counters Brian Laine, an aging law professor. "Retroactively adjusting donorship contracts now to force arbitrary family relationships is preposterously unfair, and youth don"t need the complications that come with a biological father who has no desire to be a part of their lives. So, no, I don"t think "donor dads" should have any responsibilities or involvement. The defendant, and all other sperm donors, should be legally entitled to absolute anonymity."

3. "Listen @@LEADER@@, sperm donorship responsibility is a single tree in a big forest," interrupts Hana Ryan, a no-nonsense pre-school teacher. "We need to make sure that our society is set up so that people can actually take care of their children without having to sacrifice their own well-being. That means providing more welfare programs, more affordable healthcare, and more support for single parents. Until we do that, we"re just asking people to make impossible choices and then wondering why they"re not stepping up to the plate. The government needs to provide the support that families need, so that everyone can focus on what really matters — raising happy, healthy kids."

[b][anchor=1659]#1659[/anchor]: A Dialectal Dilemma [Kors; ed: The Ankhalic Vaspriot][/b]

The Issue
@@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, a Dàguó language professor at @@ANIMAL@@ City University, was forced to resign after being reported for repeatedly using an ethnic slur about Bigtopians. However, @@HE_1@@ claims that the word in question is actually one of the most common words in the Dàguó language, which sounds extremely similar to the slur.

The Debate
1. "I"m being disgraced just for doing my job!" exclaims the former professor, gesticulating wildly. "The slur is unacceptable because of how it has been used to hurt others, but the unrelated, innocently translating Dàguó word has no such history. It"s a ubiquitous filler word like "um", and yet some inconsiderate student, who — mind you — didn"t even listen to me explain the difference, marched right on up to the dean and managed to get me fired! If you don"t make a public statement defending me, you"ll get a solid F in my book."

2. "This @@MAN@@ is clearly a racist!" proclaims @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ college student @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@, who visits the dean"s office more often than some of @@HIS_2@@ classes. "I understand using the Dàguó word sparingly in context, but @@HE_1@@ obviously knew how it sounded, and repeating it so many times was just using the Dàguó language as a veneer for @@HIS_1@@ actual racism. @@ANIMAL_INITIALS@@CU"s decision to terminate @@HIS_1@@ employment was a good start, but known racists should be placed on an employment blacklist to better prevent these incidents in the future."

3. "This wouldn"t be a problem if @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ had more exposure to the Dàguó language," asserts @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the professor"s proud Dàguó mother. "If you subsidize Little Dàguós in cities around the country, people would hear the word contextualized in broader Dàguó culture, making the difference more widely known and helping to prevent our language from being stigmatized." She hands you a cookie filled with fluffy cream. "Here, this is for you."

4. "Beats me why Dagwos are even here," remarks your portly brother, finally emerging from the washroom after 45 minutes. "We could save a lot of time by just booting all those filthy ethnic people out of our @@TYPE@@ and shutting our borders to them. No more minorities, no more misunderstandings. Besides, all they do is steal our jobs and take up valuable living space. And what if one is a spy sent by the Dagwo government to start a coup? If I lose my state-funded mansion, I"m blaming you." [[color=blue]Must allow immigration[/color]]

5. "Beats me why Dagwos are even here," remarks your portly brother, finally emerging from the washroom after 45 minutes. "We could save a lot of time by just booting any remaining non-@@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ out of our @@TYPE@@ and doubling down on border security. No more minorities, no more misunderstandings. Besides, we all know they"re responsible for everything wrong with the nation, and if I lose my state-funded mansion because one of them stages a coup, I"m blaming you."
