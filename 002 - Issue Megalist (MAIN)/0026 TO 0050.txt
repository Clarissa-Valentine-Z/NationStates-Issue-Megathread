The Debate
1. "It's not as crazy as it sounds," says Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Every day, people die because we don't have the organs to save them. Well, that and widespread under-funding of the health system.

The Debate
1. "We remain critically short of blood plasma and various organs," says @@NAME@@ One hospital administrator @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Especially hearts. A good heart is hard to find. But if we were allowed to pay for donations, we'd get more of them and could save more lives. Plus the donor takes home a few hundred @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in compensation.

2. "Great idea," says social commentator @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Except for one thing. You know who's going to be selling their organs? Poor people! They'll be so desperate for money that they'll sell their own kidneys. Well, a kidney. This is just another way for the rich to buy themselves a better life at the expense of the poor.

2. "I understand this is a very difficult time for these people," says freelance medical writer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "But the solution is not to let our medical system slide down the slippery slope of killing people in pain. We must cure, not kill. This is not the right time for euthanasia."

2. "What's so special about their homes?" says anti-smoking campaigner @@RANDOM_NAME@@.

Uneducated immigrants like these only worsen crime and steal valuable jobs! I say we should boot them all out on their ears and put a big fence around the country!"

2. @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the @@NAME@@ Civil Liberties Union says "We must welcome these refugees from any nation into our open arms, they are fleeing one oppressive dictatorial regime in the only way they know, we must not let them think they're jumping from the frying pan into the fire!"

3. "Hold on there, hold on people!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the @@NAME@@ Broadcasting company, "We don't have to take either extreme, all we have to do is make a TV game show out of it! We put deadly obstacles on the border and monitor it with television cameras! Those that make it across win freedom and citizenship, and those who don't, well, lets just say that our buzzards won't starve. We could call it 'Who Wants to be an Immigrant?'!"

[b][anchor=048]#[/anchor][anchor=48]48[/anchor]: Give Us Healthcare Or Give Us Death! [Dictator Amanda; ed: Reploid Productions][/b]

The Issue
A large group of @@NAME@@'s uninsured citizens have petitioned the government to provide a universal healthcare system, citing the poor health of many low and middle-class workers. Some of the more vocal of them are threatening violence if something isn't done.

The Debate
*1. "A universal healthcare system would provide everyone with the same quality healthcare the more wealthy and well-insured currently receive," says recently laid-off citizen and civil rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Sure, taxes would probably have to increase a bit. But isn't it worth it to provide our lower-class citizens with the same opportunities the upper-class citizens have?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**2. "Are you all INSANE? This will ruin the health insurance business and drive up unemployment rates," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the largest insurance provider in @@NAME@@. "If everyone working for their health insurance could suddenly get it free, there would be fewer jobs filled. It would get worse for everyone involved. The government should investigate the motives of these troublemaking 'protestors', instead!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

***3. "Why do we have to choose either radical option?" says your Secretary of Health, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Couldn't we just provide limited basic healthcare for our citizens and have major operations covered by private health insurance? It would be more affordable and the poor would suffer less than they do under the current system." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "A universal healthcare system is a core tenet of socialist society," says Communist Party ideologue @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Sure, taxes would probably have to increase a bit. But isn't it worth it to provide our noble workers with good healthcare, free at the point of delivery?" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

**5. "Are you all INSANE? This will drain the coffers of the State!" argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, of the @@NAME@@ Funds Disbursement Council. "If the wealth of the people is wasted on a bloated and inefficient health service, the nation will be detrimented. The government should investigate the motives of these troublemaking 'protesters', instead!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

***6. "Why do we have to choose either radical option?" asks Senior Party Representative @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Couldn't we just provide very limited basic healthcare for the majority of our citizens and have more comprehensive care as a perk from advancing within the Communist Party hierarchy? It would be more affordable, and all would aspire to better themselves." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

[b][anchor=049]#[/anchor][anchor=49]49[/anchor]: Diving For @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ [Nogero; ed: Reploid Productions][/b]

The Issue
Divers from a local scuba club have discovered an enormous underwater gold deposit that could be worth billions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in one of @@NAME@@'s lakes. It has also caused a huge debate over who should be allowed to plunder the goods.

The Debate
1. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a cabinet member, would like the government to seize the deposit. "This is an excellent time to boost @@NAME@@'s economy and increase our foreign trade with other countries! Who cares about the people that discovered the deposit? They've done their country a great favor and should let us have the money!"

2. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a civil rights activist, vehemently disagrees. "The deposit was found by private citizens and it should be their choice of what to do with the gold. If the government goes around stealing what is rightfully ours, then I shudder to think I live in such a corrupt country. These people discovered the gold, it's now their time to get rich! Nevermind the fact they were diving in a lake on government property!"

3. "We should do what now?" Environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ exclaims. "Do you have any idea how damaging it would be to the environment to mine the gold under that lake? Think of all the aquatic life that would be disrupted or destroyed! Think of how an otherwise pristine lake view would be ruined! Forget the gold and keep those money-grubbing pigs away from nature!"

[b][anchor=050]#[/anchor][anchor=50]50[/anchor]: Whips, Chains, And Leather, Oh My! [Yacatizma; ed: Reploid Productions][/b]

The Issue
An organized crowd of leather-clad individuals, some of whom are on leashes, are protesting against discrimination for those who share their interests.

The Debate
1. "We happen to express our love differently, with different hobbies and activities," explains BDSM enthusiast @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while wearing needle-sharp spiked heels and holding a whip. "Shops exist to cater to the needs of 'normal' people, but do you have ANY idea how hard it is to get a quality whip? A little support for our hobbies would be appreciated!"

2. "Yeah," exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, another enthusiast, wearing nothing but a collar, "and like other couples, we want the right to display our affection in public. If Master wants to take me walkies in public, he should be able to."

3. @@RANDOM_NAME@@ dissents wholeheartedly. "This is not about showing affection--this is about moral decency. Think of the children, for God's sake! Think of the children! We must criminalize and eliminate this perversion to keep them safe. Which of course means a special task force to track down and capture these cretins!"
