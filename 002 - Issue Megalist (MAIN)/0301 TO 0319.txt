[b][anchor=301]#301[/anchor]: Are 'Friends' Electric? [I V Stalin; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A civil war in Maxtopia, a country that provides the majority of electricity consumed in @@NAME@@, is already causing blackouts in provincial cities. Various concerned groups are demanding you take action before the situation gets worse.

The Debate
1. "Relying on other countries for something as important as electricity is a terrible idea," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the isolationist group 'We're Not Xenophobic, But'. "@@NAME@@ must be self-sufficient in its electrical needs. And if that means bringing back those nuke plants, so be it. We're a lot safer generating our own power than being at the whims of the international market, even if the tree-huggers throw a fit."

2. "Oh, don't listen to that nutjob!" says your Minister of Trade, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "We're just too focused on our relationship with Maxtopia, that's all. We must spread our net wider and take advantage of the other nations in @@REGION@@ who'd be willing to provide services for us - for a small fee."

3. A delegation from the Maxtopian rebels is ushered into your office. "OK, here's the deal. You give us arms and cash to overthrow the 'legitimate' Maxtopian government, and in return we'll halve the price we charge for electricity when we're running the place. Maybe preferential access for your corporations to our natural resources as well, yeah? I think our regimes will develop a very close alliance."

[b][anchor=302]#302[/anchor]: Delivering Mayhem In Thirty Minutes Or Less! [New Ziedrich; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Hoping to increase its market share, @@NAME@@'s second-largest pizza chain, De Luigi Bros. Pizza, began guaranteeing free pizzas if they weren't delivered in thirty minutes or less. Since the policy began several months ago, there have been several reports of De Luigi's delivery crew driving recklessly in order to beat the deadline. After a number of fatal accidents were attributed to De Luigi's drivers, citizens are calling for action.

The Debate
1. "Here's a thought," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, environmental activist and committed bicyclist, "These auto accidents wouldn't be happening if there weren't any cars in the first place! If you banned cars from our roads and focused on bikes and mass transit, we'd all be safer, and our environment would be cleaner, too. We've got nothing to lose! Except an auto industry of course. And the pizza industry will probably take a hit too, since it'll be harder to deliver the pizzas. But that doesn't matter: our safety and the planet's future do!"

[2]. "What the... hell does that have to do with anything?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, successful personal injury lawyer and owner of four sports cars. "The real issue is that De Luigi's enacted a stupid policy that resulted in injury and property damage! We need to send a clear message to big business that they'll be held liable for their mistakes, and the best way to do that, of course, is with a punitive class action lawsuit." [[color=purple]Must have a judiciary[/color]; [color=blue]Cars are legal[/color]]

3. "As usual, science has the answer!" claims renowned engineer and futurist, Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You're probably aware that there have been numerous developments in unmanned aerial vehicles over the past several years. Well, my laboratory's been developing this supersonic compact lifter drone with ASM ballistic delivery of boxes, type II AI, PIM, RTP, VTOL, GPS and a bunch of other initialisms that make it perfect for this kind of application! It performed... okay in the test run, barring the occasional cardboard-concussed bystander. So if the military would allow us to sell these things to, uh, pretty much everyone, defense contractors can make a mint manufacturing them; and pizza chains can save a small fortune by not having to pay armies of inexperienced teenage drivers! They should still carry plenty of insurance, though."

*4. "Wait, this is getting out of hand!" moans Benito De Luigi, CEO and co-founder of De Luigi Bros. Pizza. "We just wanted to dethrone those smug jerks at Papa Pallocci's, that's all! This isn't our fault; the real culprit is, uh... suburbia! Yeah! Those rows and rows of poorly-built, identical houses on stupid cul-de-sacs are a confusing nightmare for our delivery crews. Most people should be living in urban high-rise apartments, and I guess everyone else can save time by not commuting so much. Offer some incentives to get people to move: a month's free rent and a free trip to jail if they refuse to leave!" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

[b][anchor=303]#303[/anchor]: Digital Revolution Requires Re-evaluation [Coddiac; ed: Frisbeeteria][/b]

The Issue
Advances in the state of the art of television recording devices have brought the topic of sex and violence on late night television back to the table. Interested parties want to share their concerns.

The Debate
1. "I've had just about enough of this!" fulminates concerned parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who seems purple with rage. "Our children's minds are being fed garbage on a daily basis by what they see on TV. Why just the other day I caught my kid watching a DVR recorded from a late-night cartoon where a clown beat a hooker to death with a vodka bottle! We need to stop the sex and violence on TV entirely, and limit the networks to decent family programming during daytime hours."

*2. "Why should everyone else pay the price for bad parenting?" bellows libertarian and free speech advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This government needs to get out of the business of designating what we can and cannot watch. The free market will adapt to the needs of the buyers, leaving parents to do their jobs and monitor what their kids watch. I paid good money for my TV – let ME choose what I want to see!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "Why should everyone else pay the price for bad parenting?" bellows fiercely independent broadcaster @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Central planning needs to get out of the business of designating what we can and cannot watch. Broadcasters should be state-funded, of course, but content should be determined by our own independent and neutral station directors. We serve the People, not the Government!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

[4]. "You folks are missin' your best bet," celebrity race car driver @@RANDOM_NAME@@ whispers in your ear, while wearing a jumpsuit covered in product logos. "Us racers have lead the way towards makin' product placement the must-have advertising choice. Ain't no need to ban content they cain't stand. All you gotta do is hide the action behind a Microcosm computer or hold an Eckie-Ecola in front of the naughty bits, and nobody gets hurt. Them internet fellas done figured out how to throw ad banners in front of the stuff you want to see; just do the same thing on the teevee sets. Everybody wins!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

5. "You know, this gave me a fantastic idea," declares one of your advisors, grinning broadly. "So if I got this straight, children will change their behavior according to what they're exposed to on TV. So what we should do is put subliminal messages about our government in every program and commercial on TV during kid's viewing hours. That way children will stop the violence AND they'll be more inclined to serve our government when they grow up. GENIUS!"

[b][anchor=304]#304[/anchor]: Time for Paternity Leave, say Dads [Gior Altheriod; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A coalition of working parents have put forward a petition that maternity leave laws should also allow new fathers time off.

The Debate
1. "What is this madness?" splutters well-known conservative @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Think of the cost! And have you ever seen a man breastfeeding a newborn baby? I think not! You can't change basic biology by throwing @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ at it - this is one area where the women just have to face the facts."

2. "Offering different lengths of parental leave based on sex is discrimination!" yells well-known egalitarian @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pounding on your desk. "And it also disadvantages gay couples. Why shouldn't a lesbian mother have time off when her partner gives birth? I say we offer both parents six months' fully paid leave, regardless of sex. It's pricey, but it's the only way to be fair. Oh, and parents who've just adopted can have it too."

3. "I agree that we can't discriminate against gay and adoptive parents," says your Minister for the Family, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "But there's a limit to how much of a burden we can place on employers. How about offering, say, six months' joint parental leave, and letting the couple divide it up how they want? That way families can find a solution that suits them, without costing the country too much."

*4. "Are you trying to cripple our economy completely?" implores @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Money-Grabbers Ltd. "If people have children, that's their own lookout! If you can't afford to take time off work to raise your spawn, whose fault is that? All parental leave should be banned! We're not heartless bastards, though. Of course momma can take a sick or vacation day, or maybe even two!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*5. "Are you trying to cripple our economy completely?" implores @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Director of Proletariat Productivity Maximisation "If people have children, that's their own lookout! The State didn't cause the pregnancy, did it? All parental leave should be banned! We're not heartless bastards, though. Of course momma can take a sick or vacation day, or maybe even two!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

6. "There is another way, you know," quietly suggests one of your advisers, "Young children need to be taken care of during the workday, but not necessarily by their parents. What if the government provided daycare for all kids until schooling starts? Parental leave would cease to be an issue. Of course, it'd cost a lot to take care of everyone's kids, but I think it's worth it to allow parents to work full-time guilt-free."

[b][anchor=305]#305[/anchor]: Who's Occupying What? [Nexexen; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Many young, educated, and unemployed people are frustrated because jobs are being outsourced to workers in Bigtopia. On the other hand, low end service industries are seeing a shortage of workers, sparking debate over possible solutions to the employment gap.

The Debate
1. "Frankly, we shouldn't be wasting time giving our children costly educations, just to have Bigtopians take their jobs," remarks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a wealthy business executive sharing a drink in your office. "Let's lift the ban on child labor and instead put our children to work in service jobs in retail—jobs that can't be sent to other countries. They might not get paid much, but it'll at least get them working and this economy moving again." Handing you a wad of money, he continues, "And we'll both make a @@CURRENCY@@ or two off it as well…"

2. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, author of "Command Economies: The Communist Ideal" and part-time florist, slips into your office and says, "On that thought, perhaps we could use the government to allocate our resources... erm... children. To help economic efficiency, we'll split them up early on, sending some right into the workforce where the economy needs them. We'll raise the others through the education system." The noted statist thinker, deftly rearranging your vase of roses, quickly adds, "It might be expensive to manage, and kids won't get much choice in what kind of a job they get, but I think everyone will be happy after realizing that everything fits… perfectly…"

3. "Our people need jobs, but giving more money to fat-cat business owners isn't the answer!" remarks @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Occupy @@CAPITAL@@ movement, unaware of the "Hiring" sign in a nearby department store window. "In fact, we should tighten regulations on robber barons to ensure they put our workers first. And make them pay a little more in taxes to help support @@NAME@@'s hard-working people as well! Sure, the businesses may not like it, but it will help out the common man. Help the 99%!"

4. "All ze jobs are VHERE?!" General Von Gugelheimer lets out a piercing scream. "Zose Bigtopians and zeir business friends need to remember vhich is ze better country! Nevermind zat ze businesses at fault are based out of @@NAME@@. Let's blow zose Bigtopians off ze map! Double ze military's size, and ve von't have to vorry about zem anymore.

[b][anchor=306]#306[/anchor]: A Matter of Trust [Nation of Quebec; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
A new survey conducted by private organizations has found out that confidence in @@NAME@@'s political system is at an all-time low. Politicians and political think tanks are scrambling to find a solution.

The Debate
*1. "Isn't it obvious?" states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, host of a political talk show. "Politicians get away with things that would land us regular folk in jail. Corruption, fraud; you name it, they do it – and with no consequences. How about you make it harder for them to get away with their crimes by enforcing tough jail time. Maybe then you'll earn back the public's trust." [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

*2. "Isn't it obvious?" states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, host of a political talk show. "Politicians get away with things that would land us regular folk with a year of litter-picking in community service. Corruption, fraud; you name it, they do it - and with no consequences. How about you make it harder for them to get away with their crimes by enforcing tough punishments. Maybe then you'll earn back the public's trust." [[color=blue]Must not have prisons[/color]]

[3]. "It's probably because we're constantly seeing the same people in power over and over again," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a columnist for the @@NAME@@ Inquirer. "We should shake things up a bit and bring some fresh faces into the political game. Let's introduce term limits on all public offices. That'll definitely increase confidence in our political system!" [[color=purple]Must not have term limits[/color]]

[4]. "I couldn't help but notice that confidence was particularly lower among women," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, editor of Bonjour magazine. "It's time we rid this country of its old boys club by introducing gender quotas. Mandate that women must hold at least 50% of all public offices in @@NAME@@; everyone knows women are so much more trustworthy than men." [[color=purple]Must not have policies putting women in charge[/color]]

5. "People don't trust us?" gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your many advisers. "Then it's time we earned it back! Let's get out there among the people and show everybody that politicians are just like them! Be totally transparent; personal blogs, documentaries, 24 hour TV shows. Yes, it may cost a bit, but if the public know everything about you, they'll have to trust you!"

6. "If the people don't trust us then we'll make them," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your military aide-de-camp, slamming his fists on the table. "We'll just use force and intimidation to win back support. Some may call it brainwashing or terrorism, but I call it love. As a plus, it should be really easy to implement!"

[b][anchor=307]#307[/anchor]: Derailing the Gravy Train [Burtina; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
A national newspaper has uncovered details of a number of politicians' expenses documents, publishing claims from gold-plated toilet seats to elaborate steak dinners for dogs. Following the publication, the general public is clamoring at your door demanding answers.

The Debate
1. "This is the sort of disgraceful behavior we've come to expect from our politicians," bemoans unemployed teacher, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Look around you! No one else is living so extravagantly. We need to lower all politicians' salaries to the poverty line and put the kibosh on these claimed 'business expenses' too. Maybe then they'll understand how real people actually live in @@NAME@@."

2. "This is quite absurd!" scoffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, taking a sip of Bollinger '86. "We toil day in and day out keeping this country running, and this is the thanks we get? Newspapers snooping around our personal business, questioning what we need to do our jobs. We incur certain, necessary expenses that may look odd when taken out of context – and that's just what the media is doing! They're distorting the facts just to boost their ratings.

[b][anchor=308]#308[/anchor]: Over, Under or Through? [Platform VII; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
After recent economic growth, ferry links with the @@NAME@@ Barrier Islands are struggling to cope under the increasing volume of commuters and cargo.

The Debate
1. "A government's first duty is to its people," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the @@NAME@@ Highways Agency. "The best way to serve the people is to encourage auto traffic by building bridges. With bridges we can not only serve the residential needs, but the commercial too. True, it will take a few years of construction and there's bound to be some environmental impact, but that's the price of progress."

2. "Some environmental impact?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of the Environment. "More bridges means more traffic, which means more pollution. What we need to do is build a rail tunnel. One train can carry more cargo than many trucks and with my electric train design, it'll be much more eco-friendly. Of course the government will have to subsidize it to keep the prices reasonable, but the benefit to the environment is worth it."

[3]. "More government involvement isn't what we need," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of Ferry Nice. "We're in this mess because the government can't keep up with the times. Let the private sector run these docks, and watch how quickly it turns around. Of course, it wouldn't hurt to raise the limit of how many passengers each boat can take." [[color=blue]Must not be Socialist[/color]]

4. "Halt this at once!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a pitchfork wielding island resident. "What about us? Did you ever once stop to ask if the residents wanted all this commotion? Well we don't! We like our islands nice and quiet just the way Mother Nature made them."

The Issue
In response to the recent government mandate to execute anyone over the age of 65, an insurgency of highly organized and skilled (albeit slow) senior citizens bombed a national government building. Following the explosion, the leader of the insurgents issued an 8mm reel of demands.

The Debate
1. "We won't stand for this tomfoolery," barks a shadowy figure who only identifies himself as Logan, "Do you know how many wars we've fought for you ungrateful whippersnappers? We built this damn country, and now because we don't fit into your fancy budget, you're trying to kill us! Well no more! If you don't cease this genocidal nonsense AND give us back our pensions, we, Logan's Runners, will wage all-out war on @@CAPITAL@@!"

2. "They won't be 'standing' for anything when I'm done with them," threatens Major General @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We can't allow this kind of insubordination. Your country needs a strong leader who's willing to back up their mandates – with force if necessary. God help anyone who stands in our way. Provide me with the necessary funds and give my men the authority to search anywhere they please, and I'll smoke out these traitorous geezers like the filthy rats they are!"

3. "Alright, we were a little excessive with that law," admits @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Finance, "But we can't just reverse it and go back to the horror days of gold-plated pensions. The budget can't handle it! We'll nix the death squads, and the elderly will be allowed to live, but only in our government approved facilities. They'll be given only what they need to survive, and we'll avoid a budgetary crisis."

[b][anchor=310]#310[/anchor]: Too Little Talk? [Panageadom; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Opposition newspapers have accused the government of abusing its control over the filibuster ban, which it can use to limit the length of legislative debate. You have consulted multiple people in search of solutions.

The Debate
*1. “Now, now, my friend,” smiles the wealthiest CEO in the @@MAYOR_INDUSTRY@@ industry, reclining in a shady corner, “We simply can’t have a few radicals dictate government policy to us. After all, we do know what’s best, don’t we? First it’s this reform, next it’s a slew of unproductive economic policies, and then before you know it they’re limiting campaign donations. You can see that some issues have no merit, and are simply not worthy of debate. Perhaps we should even halt the debate before such silliness even begins...?” The CEO hands you a wad of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. “You agree. Now there’s a good leader.” [[color=blue]Must allow Private Industries[/color]]

*2. “Now, now, my friend,” smiles an anonymous political strategist, reclining in a shady corner, “We simply can’t have a few radicals dictate government policy to us. After all, we do know what’s best, don’t we? First it’s this reform, next it’s a slew of anti-socialist policies, and then before you know it they’re threatening the democratically elected Communist government. You can see that some issues have no merit, and are simply not worthy of debate. Perhaps we should even halt the debate before such silliness even begins...?” @@HE@@ hands you a wad of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. “You agree. Now there’s a good leader.” [[color=red]Must not allow Private Industries[/color]]

3. "I think we can all see the benefits of the filibuster ban," says political science professor, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "But it's also true that putting it in the hands of the reigning party coalition is a dangerous centralisation of power. Why not simply have an independent, representative committee to decide what issues are worthy of a lengthy debate? It might be a tad erratic in its priorities, but at least it would give the power back to the people. That's a good thing, right?"

4. "The government, all the way up to @@LEADER@@, has used this ban as a way to control parliament," declares Opposition Whip @@RANDOM_NAME@@, speaking from the Floor, "They're perfectly happy to let debates about the most inconsequential of matters rage on for hours, but when it comes to a serious discussion of @@LEADER@@'s murky ties to prominent members of the @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ industry or policies genuinely aimed at helping the general public, rather than a select few, the debate comes to a quick close. We must overturn the filibuster ban, post-haste. And I think it is clear to all who suffer from this. That's right, my friends, ladies and gentlemen, casual onlookers, convenient family members, cultural attachés, politically active tourists and constituents, both loyal and traitorous to the greater cause; the people. The people suffer the injustices of a government pandering to its corporate cronies, its oligarchic overlords, its necessary nepotists, if you will. They suffer the delirious - ah - deleterious effects of a government sans filibuster, sans fairness, sans freedom! This ridiculous policy ignores the fact that some things require longer and more serious deliberation - as does, indeed, this very issue. But I am diverging from my abundantly clear point, supported by the voices of a thousand-strong crowd outside this very building. And while we might quibble over the numbers - a thousand, I hear you cry? Tens - hundreds! - of thousands, surely? But this ignores the fundamental spirit of the times - zeitgeist, if you will - that we stand against this filibuster ban clearly and unwaveringly. Anyway, a discussion of the genuinely humanitarian policies my party espouses, which require a debate of adequate length for the complexities of which to be fully understood, are quickly relegated as the government trots out its latest quick-fix or vote-snatching policy. Now, to move onto my second point of four-hundred-and-thirty-eight of my first speech - I will, of course, pass over to my comrade on the bench in due course." The security guards by the door notice your discreet signal and step quietly towards the Whip's podium. "Perhaps we should investigate further… excuse me…?" stammers the Whip, as your guards gingerly carry @@HIM@@ away. "Ah … yes, thank you for your time."

The Issue
A recent article in [i]The @@CAPITAL@@ Naysayer[/i] has exposed a dirty little secret: prison wardens have been quietly selling the organs from executed criminals and pocketing the proceeds. Enraged citizens, particularly victim's rights organizations, demand retribution.

The Debate
1. "These murderers took away took away our families and our futures", cries Victims of Violence chapter head @@RANDOM_NAME@@, holding a black-draped family photo. "The court ordered restitution, but most criminals have no money. These wardens are stealing the only thing of value these criminals still have: their organs! Give surviving family members the remuneration from these sales. It's the very least you can do after all we've suffered."

2. "We have also lost family to murders and nothing will bring them back to our loving arms", weeps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a member of Victims for a Just Society. "Monetary reimbursement can't replace what we have lost, but perhaps others can benefit from our loss. We must expand the list of capital crimes to discourage criminals from committing any crimes at all, while providing a substantial source of new organs to our hospitals. Criminals can repay society by helping the ailing victims of organ failure. Let transplant survivors be our memorial!"

3. A serene voice from the back commands the crowd's attention. "My children, we cannot relieve violence with violence", intones @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Roshi of @@CAPITAL@@ Zendo, sitting zazen. "The solution lies not with taming corrupt officials, but within ourselves. We should not be killing these criminals; we should be leading them.

The Debate
1. "We need to hit back hard at these terrorist scumbags!" roars General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, his face turning purple. "I say that we treat any illegal weapons program by these nations as an act of war! Granted, a preemptive strike will likely cause a war, but if these foreigners won't abide by international agreement, they have to be kept in line, for the good of our @@TYPE@@."

2. Diplomatic bureaucrat @@RANDOM_NAME@@ remarks calmly, "There's no need to go off half-cocked. It would be much better if we used some international body - the World Assembly, say, or a @@REGION@@ tribunal - to investigate these rumours objectively for us. That way we have the international community on our side, and no one can accuse us of playing judge and jury. It will be well worth the extra diplomatic costs and bureaucratic red tape."

[3]. "If these countries don't respect international law, why would they respect international agencies?" wonders political analyst @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Our neighbours are acquiring these weapons for a reason - because no one wants to pick a fight with a country that has weapons of mass destruction.

4. Noted pacifist and tambourine artist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ replies, "As usual our nation's proud leaders can only see violent solutions to our problems abroad.

The Issue
A religious scholar was recently arrested over refusing to serve in @@NAME@@'s Armed Services on moral grounds. Small – but very vocal – demonstrations have started over compulsory military service and a citizen's right to be a conscientious objector.

The Debate
1. "Conscription flies in the face of my religion," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Grand Poobah of the Order of Maxx. "It clearly states in our holy book that 'Thou mayest not blow Thine enemies to tiny bits, in Thy mercy'. The devout of @@NAME@@ should have the option to opt out of service.

The Issue
A recent investigation by [i]The @@CAPITAL@@ Times[/i] has shown that the nation's tough adultery laws have hit the poor hardest. An odd assortment of left-wing activists, religious leaders, and scantily clad protesters have demanded the government take action as more of @@NAME@@'s impoverished citizens find themselves in prison.

The Debate
1. "I think you're forgetting the real reason why people have affairs," suggests noted socialist leader, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Everything seems more tempting when you have nothing to lose. How can you blame these people for turning to turning to, shall we say 'alternative partners', when they lack the skills to provide for themselves? If the government funded some new job training programs for the unemployed and increased the welfare budget just a tad, you will not only lower unemployment rates, but adultery along with it."

2. "Economics has nothing to do with it. Government simply has no place in the bedroom!" shouts longtime sexual freedoms advocate, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing nothing but a conveniently placed protest sign. "Politicians - who, may I remind you, have more affairs than anyone else - are only standing by this fundamentalism to get the religious vote! You'll save much more face if you admit you screwed up and repealed this archaic law."

3. "I told thee so! I told thee so!" invokes Reverend @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Whatever happened to the sanctity of marriage? It's obvious we've become too lenient. We need to strike the fear of divine retribution into these sinners before the problem gets any worse. A good ol' stoning ought to do it!"

4. "Adultery isn't the real issue," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who at fifty years old is still single and proud of it. "Why not ban marriage? It's not like matrimony means anything these days when you consider all the divorces, shams, casino weddings, and fake celebrity weddings. Besides, weddings are EXPENSIVE. Talk about a waste of perfectly good money."

[b][anchor=315]#315[/anchor]: Creative Flowers Withering Under Legislation [Panageadom; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
Following a record number of affirmative action lawsuits last month, the creative minds, radio personalities and actors of @@NAME@@ have to come to your office demanding the government take action.

The Debate
1. "It simply won't do, darling!" opines melodramatic director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sprawled magnificently across a sofa, "The creative arts simply cannot function without a healthy dash of social criticism. How can fine humor work without the blonde bombshells, bumbling Bigtopians and blustering bureaucrats? And yet I cannot hire them, for fear of discrimination lawsuits. Pah! The government must protect artists' right to freely choose whom to include - and whom to ridicule - in their work. After all, everyone knows not too take it too seriously..."

2. "Why should the entertainment industry receive special treatment?" bellows conservative talk-show host, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "People should damn well have the freedom to insult or employ whoever they like. That's a privilege everyone should enjoy, not just a bunch of artsy leftists. What gives the government the right to tell me what I can or cannot say on my show? Besides, what sane man on Earth would hire one of those dodgy Maxtopians?"

3. "No! You can't let this happen!" screams actress Susan Simmer, infamous for her dismissal from a hit TV show for being "incredibly ugly". "Society gets its opinions about what's acceptable from the TV these days. That's where we need to be toughest about stamping out discrimination! I say any writer or director who won't toe the line should be forced into mandatory racial sensitivity training! It's the only way to prevent decadent backsliding and stamp out racism for the sake of future generations!"

4. "I believe it's time for the government to step in and take control," hisses notoriously shifty advisor, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, stepping out of a shadowy corner. "If we were to hire writers to produce scripts with the "correct" subtexts and broadcast them over state-owned radio and television, we could solve all the problems at hand. We would be employing writers, but – more importantly - we'd be spearheading the development of a fiercely loyal citizenry."

[b][anchor=316]#316[/anchor]: Fortified Against Crime [Praedico; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Owing to high crime rates, wealthy residents of several cities are asking for permission to build walls around their neighborhoods and employ private security to keep the peace. Several advocacy groups have gathered in your office to lobby regarding gated communities.

The Debate
1. "Crime rates in our city have sky-rocketed recently," says distressed investment banker, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "And we think we should be allowed to shelter ourselves from the criminal hordes with armed private security. We've got contractor bids in place for a sturdy, steel-reinforced wall with electrified razor wire and poisoned barbs. Oh, and lasers - got to have lasers! Granted, it probably won't reduce the crime rate in the rest of the city, but frankly, that's not our problem."

2. "Of course it's your problem," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, police chief of @@CAPITAL@@. "If you reduce the crime rate in the whole city, you won't need walls and private guards. Even you rich types have to come out occasionally, if only to take in the theatre or attend a gala or whatever it is you do. Mansion owners would probably end up paying more in increased taxes than they would for private security, but they'd be helping others too, so I can't see why they'd have a problem with that."

3. "Well, I do have a problem with that!" shouts a stock broker, helping himself to a couple of luxury chocolates from the box on your desk. "The rich are overtaxed as it is. Why, I've only been able to afford two new swimming pools this year! However, I think this proposal has got things backwards. What we should be doing is walling up the inner cities to keep the criminal types inside. With the poor confined to ghettos, normal people could go about their business in peace. Just take the funds from public transport or something. It's not as if the poor will be needing to travel any more."

4. "Down with the rich!" cries working-class protester @@RANDOM_NAME@@, jumping on your desk and waving a red flag. "They shouldn't be allowed to set up their own pocket kingdoms! What about the rest of us, huh? We're not all criminals just because we're poor! Most of the rich are bigger criminals than any burglar could be anyway. The police should concentrate on arresting them. They couldn't complain about being robbed if they were all in prison, could they?" While being forcibly removed by your guards, she adds, "Oh, and reduce taxes on the poor while you're at it."

[b][anchor=317]#317[/anchor]: Big Brother Is Watching You Surf [Vintaland; ed: The Most Glorious Hack][/b]

The Issue
Advisers from @@NAME@@'s security services have created a small piece of spyware that they would like to install on every computer in the nation so they can track activity.

The Debate
1. "For the good of all," claims Department of Protection head @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This tiny little program will simply collect data and send it via the internet to one of our databases. Nobody will even notice that it's there. Besides, who's gonna notice a handful of bytes under mountains of stolen MP3s? Just give us the green light and we'll be rounding up terrorists faster than you can say 'lolcat'! And, hey, while we're at it, we could even use it to alert people when there's danger!"

2. "Are you insane?" shouts privacy advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "These are our personal computers; they're not the government's property! The last thing we need is the government poking its big, fat nose into our business. Keep the government's hands off my harddrive! What's next? Brain implants? Leave my brainwaves alone, you jack-booted thugs!"

3. "While 'tis not my place," says Amish farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "I just thought I'd mention that we Amish don't have any of this so-called 'cyber-crime'. Aye, 'tis a boring life, and plowin' gets old, but abolishing all of those computer-machines would certainly solve thy problems. Perhaps ye should just abandon phones and fax machines, too. Then ye'll be on your way to livin' in an Amish paradise!"

[b][anchor=318]#318[/anchor]: Death Penalty on Death Row? [Andacantra; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
After new DNA evidence has proven that recently executed inmate @@RANDOM_NAME@@ was actually innocent, human rights activists have been campaigning to ban the death penalty.

The Debate
1. "This is government sanctioned murder!" chants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a human rights activist, from outside your office door. "It must end! Not only is it murder, but it amounts to hypocrisy of the highest nature. Yeah, keeping criminals locked up instead of mercilessly killing them might be costly, but maybe we can offset the cost by putting them to work making handcrafts in the prison store? Regardless, we have to abolish the death penalty - it's the only right and moral thing to do!"

2. "What about other potential criminals out there?" whimpers @@NAME@@ Neighbourhood Watch spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has taken to hiding beneath your desk. "Did you know that since we introduced the death penalty the crime rate has decreased hugely? I say we introduce the death penalty for more crimes, like burglary and trespassing, and then no-one will ever dare to do anything wrong!"

3. "There's absolutely no proof that the crime rate has decreased", states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your foreign affairs advisor, with a nod. "But I have an idea. If we're going to be killing these people, we ensure it's as non-violent and as respectful as possible; make our executions more humane and give these people some choice in how they die. The international community will love us for our civility and humaneness. We'll be an international benchmark!"

4. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Chief Deputy Assistant Police Commissioner states, swirling a pair of handcuffs on one finger. "We don't go around executing innocent people for the fun of it; accidents happen! So those hippy people should quit their boo-hooin'. Look, if we give our boys in blue some more cash maybe there'll be less room for mistakes. Everyone goes away happy."

5. "Hows abo' bringin' back dem-dere good ol' fashioned lynchings? Bring justice back ter tha peoples!" shouts Jethro, a survivalist. "Who'd dare ta kill innocent peoples when tha punishmen' is bein' pelted ta death wit' rocks?"

[b][anchor=319]#319[/anchor]: Sizing Up The Competition [Cosumar; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
After a recent conversion mistake cost a government research project millions in @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@, @@NAME@@'s scientists have come to you begging for the country to switch to the metric system.

The Debate
1. "Our measurement system is a complete disaster!" wails renowned engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, brandishing the odd-looking result of a recent project. "We're stuck using primitive and illogical measurements like 'fingers' or 'donkeypower' or 'MegaFonzie'. It's too much! Practically every other nation in @@REGION@@ has converted to the metric system. Think of how much it would help our international communication! It'll cost a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to convert, but it'll be damn cheaper than the mistakes our system is causing!"

2. "Primitive? How dare that lab rat say such a thing!" spits infamous patriot @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "They're not just measurements; they're part of our cultural heritage. Where would we be without our attoparsecs, hogsheads, or shakes of a @@ANIMAL@@'s tail? You want to throw that all away because some scientists are too lazy to do their jobs correctly. Give the taxpayers a break and ignore these eggheads."

3. "This. This is a crossroads." states noted avant garde artist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This idea that we can standardize how people look at the world with words, it's a fool's errand. Everything's relative, man. We need to stop trying to control the world and just live. Imagine how happy our nation'd be with no measurements." He pauses to puff on a pipe. "No time like the present, @@LEADER@@. No time."
