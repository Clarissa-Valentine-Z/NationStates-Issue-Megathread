[b][anchor=820]#820[/anchor]: These Heels Weren't Made For Working [Baggieland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Mrs. Gertrude @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@ recently retired after 40 years working as a hotel receptionist. Severe arthritis of her feet - attributed by her doctors to a lifetime of wearing high-heeled shoes - has led to a great difficulty in walking even a short distance.

The Debate
1. "My feet are killing me," bemoans Gertrude, "and it's all the fault of a ridiculous dress code forced on me by my employers. I've been crippled by my work, and now I'm stuck with pain and loss of mobility. The government should ban employers from making particular clothes a condition of work. It's frankly sexist when us women are forced to wear high-heeled shoes! If I can save just one person from experiencing the torture I'm suffering now, then it will have been worth the effort of walking here today."

2. "What's wrong with wanting staff to look professional?" queries @@RANDOMNAMEMALE@@, staff manager at the renowned Iddiott-Hellton Hotel. "We just want our employees to look respectable while they're dealing with clients. Nobody forced this old girl to take this job! Look, @@LEADER@@, if you really want to help, maybe you could set an example by seeing to your own attire. Honestly, everything you are wearing could use a hot iron and some starch."

3. "You know, messing with dress code rules could be a lot of fun!" giggles your brother, seeming even more deranged than usual. "We could make all the men wear suits of armour on a Tuesday, clown suits on a Wednesday or Dogman costumes for the second week of every month. And you force the ladies into maid costumes or air hostess uniforms. C'mon, you've gotta make this happen. It would be so great!"

[b][anchor=821]#821[/anchor]: A Switch In Time Kills Nine [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A tragic train derailment recently resulted in the untimely death of nine people. Investigators have noted that the accident occurred the morning after daylight saving time went into effect, and concluded that it was likely due to conductor fatigue from the time change. You've shifted your schedule by an hour to discuss the matter.

The Debate
1. "It's high time we made a change," declares somnologist Dr. Van Winkle, pouring @@HIMSELF@@ a second cup of coffee. "The fact is, our work days are no longer slaves to the sun and moon, and so our body clocks shouldn't be either. The interruption of circadian rhythm and resultant accident risk are demonstrably deadly. Make this change, and you'll be a legend in your own time."

2. "Once again, our ancestors were ahead of their time," proclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, a patchouli-scented, bushy-bearded historian. "The future of @@NAME@@ is sundials, and they should be the only clocks our nation uses! We'll always be in harmony with the natural beat of the sun and our inherent sleep rhythms, no matter what our specific space-time location is. Yes, slight differences in each city's clocks might make train timetables and computers and such trivialities a little bit useless, but isn't synchronicity with the universe more important than an artificial obsession with seconds and minutes?"

3. "No! Not the railways!" gasps your Minister of the Environment and amateur ferroequinologist @@RANDOMNAME@@, who is currently wearing a worn-out conductor's hat. "Look, I hate to derail this whole train of thought, but daylight saving is not only a cultural part of what makes us @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@, it also holds a valuable role in energy conservation. With it in place, @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ use less lighting during summer evenings and less heat during winter mornings. You should not only keep it, you should also make sure that all who do business in @@NAME@@ are compliant with it."

[b][anchor=822]#822[/anchor]: Never Work With Children [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
A children's rights activist sparked controversy when she wrote a column for [i]The @@CAPITAL@@ Herald[/i]. In a penetrating exposé, she denounced the practice of using child actors in TV commercials and movies, calling it "downright child abuse" and demanding that child actors be banned from working.

The Debate
1. "Look at this!" exclaims the children's rights activist in question, @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, as she shows you the video of a cute tot guzzling Eckie-Ecola and gurgling, 'I yove my Eckie-Ecoya!' with a huge grin on his chubby face. "This might look like a 30-second commercial, but children often spend a whole day at the studio to complete the shots. Movies take months of long, gruelling days! If these kids were working in a sweatshop, everyone would be infuriated. Child labour doesn't stop being abuse when children work in a film set. You should ban kids from acting immediately."

2. "Whoa! How are we supposed to film the third sequel to [i]How To Train Your Unicorn[/i] without rug rat... valued child actors?" yells film director @@RANDOMNAME@@, flanked by a small girl wearing a princess gown. "If anything, we should relax our overprotective labour laws, encouraging movies - all our vital industries - to utilise [i]more[/i] kids. That way, children can familiarise themselves with the camera and become the future stars of @@NAME@@! Besides, kids love play-acting, and we always ask for their consent. Don't you like being a princess, sweetie?"

3. "Dear, please be reasonable here," says Mrs. Suspectfire, the presenter of a popular children's show, looking at you over her wire-framed glasses. "Let's admit: commercials and movies do need child actors. But we must make sure they're not exploited, by limiting the working hours. If we just allow child actors to work for no more than one hour per day, nobody can say that is child abuse."

[b][anchor=823]#823[/anchor]: Where The Sun Don't Shine [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
When your Minister for Health fell asleep for the third time in your Cabinet meeting, you confronted @@HIM@@. @@HE@@ told you @@HIS@@ doctor had diagnosed @@HIM@@ with vitamin D deficiency. In fact, @@HIS@@ department estimates this condition may be affecting almost half of all @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@.

The Debate
1. "It's because @@NAME@@ is such a gloomy place," @@HE@@ yawns, yanking apart the curtains of the conference room to let a feeble ray of sun shine in. "Look, I know we can't change the weather, but perhaps we can help people get more sunlight by promoting an outdoor culture. Why should we be cooped up in enclosed spaces like offices and schools? Give a tax break for businesses that have their workers under an open sky!"

[2]. "If you go out in @@NAME@@, you're likely to die of exposure," snarls @@RANDOMNAME@@, the owner of a local tanning salon, handing you a brochure with pictures of perfectly tanned top models. "If you subsidised sunbed services, people could enjoy the benefits of wholesome Sunny Day Natural Health Rays (tm), even when it is raining outside." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3. "All this natural sunlight seems to be a bit complicated," says synthetic chemistry enthusiast @@RANDOMNAME@@, happily munching on @@HIS@@ morning toast enhanced with a colloid of crunch-enhancing plastic beads. "I mean, everyone loves chemistry. Require fortification of bread products, breakfast cereals and other foods with pre-isomerised 7-dehydrocholesterol, and then everyone will have healthy bones and teeth." @@HE@@ stops talking to spit out a broken tooth.

4. "Nothing new under the sun, huh?" butts in @@RANDOMNAME@@, your elderly neighbour, slipping out of @@HIS@@ bathrobe to proudly expose sagging skinfolds and liver-spotted buttocks. "There's plenty of sunlight outside if you ask me. The problem is that light can't get through the fabric barriers that we mummify ourselves with! Enforce compulsory nudity, and let bodies luxuriate in the sun! For health!" @@HE@@ leers hopefully at an attractive young intern, miming the removal of clothing.

[b][anchor=824]#824[/anchor]: Period Drama [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Tonight's big family dinner seemed like such a nice idea. Alas, it's all descended into awkward silences and short tempers again. This is mostly thanks to your sister's complaints about the high price of feminine sanitary products, which she largely attributes to the so-called "tampon tax": a sales tariff on these items.

The Debate
1. "It's a bloody outrage! The patriarchy seems to believe that tampons and pads aren't essentials," rails your sister @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@, waving a grocery receipt under your nose. "You have to stop taxing feminine products! If the income stream is so important to you, stick it on income tax instead! Women everywhere are demanding change. Can't you go with the flow?"

2. "Don't make a scene, dear," soothes your mother, patting her on the shoulder. "If the prices are bleeding you dry or cramping your style, I'm sure your dear sibling will have the state buy them for you, and for all @@NAME@@'s ladies. That's what government is for, isn't it darling?"

3. "Ugh, I can't believe that your sister would even talk about such things at the dinner table," moans Uncle @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, handing out copies of his self-published pamphlet, [i]Women: For Pity's Sake, Don't Talk[/i]. "It completely put me off my borscht. If it were up to me, I'd make it a crime to publicly discuss women's monthly troubles. Some things are best kept private, period!"

4. "Let's try and be balanced here," whispers your Treasury Minister @@RANDOMNAME@@, wishing @@HE@@'d never accepted the invitation to your family home. "Sales tax is vital to help keep the burden of income tax down, but it's a good thing to be equitable. Why not add sales tax to men's daily goods like razors and shaving cream? That way, everybody pays their fair share."

[b][anchor=825]#825[/anchor]: Bugging Out On Beef [Arcunem; ed:  Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
A school in @@NAME@@ recently made headlines for farming crickets, mealworms and other invertebrates for consumption in the cafeteria. As the surprisingly professional and detailed science project write-up cited relatively low levels of greenhouse gas production involved compared to traditional pastoral farming, environmental activists are agitating the national government for action.

The Debate
*1. "You know, if you all were a little more open-minded to chomping down on critters, we'd be better off. Once you get over the fear factor you'll start pounding these babies down your esophagus by the handful," says Can You Eat It? contestant and professional snowboarder @@RANDOMNAME@@. "They're super efficient at converting plant feed to protein and, like, way better for the environment! We should stick some funds into farming and slap some regulations on Big Cow and Big Chicken!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. "Listen here!" starts @@RANDOMNAME@@, National Director of Agriculture and Farming, tapping menacingly at a dreary flip-chart. "Our department has been trying to balance the demand for high-protein foodstuffs for an ever-growing population with the resources we have at hand. Farming the humble invertebrate takes up far less space than conventional meat farming, and they quite literally eat rubbish! Some people might make a meal out of eating mealworm pasta, but I'm sure they'll swallow it if we tell them it's for the greater good." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

3. "Insects? On my dinner plate?" squirms health inspector @@RANDOMNAME@@, consulting a thick tome. "Well, there isn't any legislation as such that bans the eating of insects, but if we're going to start farming these critters then we're going to do it by the book. It has to be humane and hygienic, with proper documentation of all livestock, a chain of providence from field to slaughterhouse for each individual, and mandated minimum living space."

4. "Are you kiddin' me? I'd rather eat cow dung than pop one of 'em nasty crickers in my mouth," worriedly proclaims foodstuff trucker @@RANDOMNAME@@. "I'll stick to eatin' thick, juicy...stea..." @@HE@@ trails off at the sight of a roadside cafe. "Anyway, in this country we don't eat that trash - we have standards. Stick to pumpin' out cows, chickens, and all those glorious mammalian meat-sacs of the Earth for @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ barbecue. Hell, let's raise more!"

*5. "@@HEfromoption4@@ is right, but chooses the path of the gluttonous and unclean," intones @@RANDOMNAME@@, sporting bright yellow robes and a sunflower headdress. "Vermin are forbidden by our holy verses for mortal consumption as they are agents of pestilence and disease. Consuming the flesh of animals of the land and sea is also forbidden as they are our fellow brethren. For the sake of our immortal souls, we must ban the consumption of animal flesh entirely." [[color=blue]Religion is legal[/color]]

*6. "Am I the only one in the room who actually read the study?" butts in militant vegetarian @@RANDOMNAME@@. "It says that farming these insects is better for the environment than raising animals for meat. News flash--it's still bad for the environment! Listen, everyone knows that the most ecologically friendly diet out there is a vegetarian one. Why are we taking half measures when we could simply outlaw eating animals of any kind?"

[b][anchor=826]#826[/anchor]: Licencing Driving @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ Crazy [Omakhandia; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
Your cousin arrived at your office this afternoon, out of breath and deeply frustrated at having to spend day after day filling out forms, only to wait for six hours in a queue to register for another appointment to receive @@HIS@@ 27B/6 form to finalize @@HIS@@ registration and legally drive the sweet new ride @@HE@@ bought six weeks ago. You've agreed, after some persuasion, to hold a meeting with your Minister of Transportation and other experts to look into streamlining the process.

The Debate
1. "It's very important that we get all this information from drivers," explains @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Transportation. "We have to make absolutely sure that our roads are safe, that all drivers are properly licensed, and that cars reported stolen are easily identified. If that means a bit of extra paperwork, so be it. Increase our budget for staff and we'll be able to expedite the registration process."

*2. "I have a radical idea," announces @@RANDOMNAME@@, the CEO of @@NAME@@'s largest automobile manufacturer. "Simply license car dealerships to handle these processes for consumers! We can fill out all the necessary insurance paperwork for car owners, and even issue driving permits! The DMV is only slow because it has no competition. If dealerships can compete with one another for the best service, buying and registering a new car won't be such a frustrating ordeal!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "I have a radical idea," announces @@RANDOMNAME@@, a mid-level Department of Motor Vehicles manager. "You know how those filthy capitalists are always prattling on about competition? Well, let's instill a little competition amongst different local licensing offices. Give them more discretion about what paperwork to require and fees to charge. This problem will work itself out in no time." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "Licenses? We don't need no stinkin' licenses!" exclaims a scruffy-looking man who took a wrong turn and wandered into your meeting. "Why should the government have any say in who can and can't drive? Get rid of permits, licenses, traffic cops, borders, barriers, speed limits, road laws, and identification plates, and just let people live their lives!"

[b][anchor=827]#827[/anchor]: Making Money Hand Over Fist [Kaschovia; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
In a highly-anticipated boxing match between 'Pretty Boy' @@RANDOMMALENAME@@ and @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ 'The Junkyard Dog' @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@ watched by millions across the nation, both competitors walked away with more than one hundred million @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@. Critics are claiming that the fight has ushered in a new wave of spoilt, egotistical, money-grabbing athletes.

The Debate
1. "It is utterly ridiculous," tuts @@RANDOMNAME@@, a freelance journalist who formerly focused on politics but is rumored to have switched to reporting on sports to pay the bills. "If I knew dancing around like a fairy for an hour could earn me that much, I certainly wouldn't be wasting my time writing! The government should peg athletes' salaries to another hardworking profession, like freelance journalism, to curb this unfair advantage."

2. "That just doesn't cut it," interjects @@RANDOMNAME@@, head of a wage equality group. "What about the actor getting paid a princely sum for spending a day acting in a commercial? Or a CEO getting paid fifty times what their workers make to lounge on the golf course? The government should regulate all professions. Professional pay will no longer be a matter of industry and business, but of legality and government policy."

3. "They must think we're grabbing money from their... wal... uh, wall... er... pockets," mumbles the no longer so handsome-looking @@firstmentionedname@@, who lost the fight in a knockout. "Lots of people paid to see the fight and I ear... uhh... what's the word? EARNED that money. In fact, you should... pro... prom... help make more people watch our fights.

4. "Those critics are just cowardly keyboard warriors," hisses the infamously tough boxing coach @@RANDOMNAME@@. "I'm sure anyone critical of athletes' salaries would quickly shut up if we forced them into a real fighting situation. They'd be good punching bags for the million @@CURRENCY@@ fighter I'm training."

[b][anchor=828]#828[/anchor]: Your Execution In 30 Years Or Less Or You're Free [Saithal; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Thirty years ago, serial killer @@RANDOMNAME@@ was sentenced to death, and has been on death row ever since due to constant appeals and backlogs. @@HE@@ was found dead of natural causes in @@HIS@@ cell this morning, prompting concerned lawyers, law and order advocates, and everyone else with an opinion to protest the monumental gaps between verdicts and execution.

The Debate
1. "Do you realize how much of our budget is being spent on housing these criminals?" cries government auditor @@RANDOMNAME@@, as @@HE@@ dots an I and crosses Ts on the latest government expense report. "I understand death row is needed as an ultimate punishment for those who deserve it, but we can't keep spending truckloads of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ keeping these people for years or even decades on end! We need to set a maximum number of years before the sentencing and execution. Have some mercy on our budget!"

2. "It doesn't have to take as long as it does," proclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, a newly-appointed prosecutor. "If someone tries to make an appeal for 'jury misconduct' or 'having an impaired lawyer', that can delay the process exponentially. If we remove the ability for inmates on death row to appeal, I am positive you'll see a large decrease in spending on death row and faster trials overall."

3. "Time limits? Preventing appeals?" gasps @@RANDOMNAME@@, a simple country criminal defense lawyer from Southern @@NAME@@. "Inmates are still people! Long waiting times are the price we pay for making sure everyone @@NAME@@ executes is absolutely guilty. Violet help us if we execute an innocent person! Years of [i]habeas corpus[/i] proceedings and a large backlog are a small price to pay to ensure justice is truly served. In fact, we need to make it easier for convicted felons to appeal their often harsh sentencing."

4. "Clearly, the easiest solution is to execute people once they receive a guilty verdict!" chimes in horror movie aficionado @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Going to the courtroom would be so much more fun if you got to watch people die! Don't tell me you wouldn't go see a trial if that was the case. Oh, and it would probably save money or something."

5. "Or we could just abolish capital punishment," interjects your teenage niece as she takes a break from protesting other perceived injustices in @@NAME@@. "You want to save money on killing people? Just stop killing people. Appeals are quite expensive, you know."

[b][anchor=829]#829[/anchor]: Winning At Battleship [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed:  Sedgistan and Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
In an ongoing war that @@NAME@@ is embroiled in, your navy managed to capture something interesting: a huge but ageing battleship. You are now the arbiter of her fate.

The Debate
1. "She's not likely to be a very useful military asset in this day and age," explains shipyard director @@RANDOMNAME@@ while putting some blue papers on your desk. "After all, she was pretty easily captured by our navy. But look at what she's made of - seventy thousand tons of steel! Think how many cars you could make with that. Help us build ship-breaking yards on the shoreline of @@NAME@@, and it'll boost the coastal economy forever."

2. Admiral @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, who coordinated the capture, has a different point of view. "Our navy has been sorely underfunded for years; this ship could be part of the boost we need. Back in the age of sail, navy captains who brought home prizes like this were rewarded and thereby encouraged to keep bringing home more prizes. Those ships would then be crewed, and made our fleet stronger! I think we should bring that system back in place so that our courageous sailors can expand our forces and prove themselves."

3. "Corals grow very well on iron," comments environmentalist and hippie @@RANDOMNAME@@, dumping @@HIS@@ banjo and flowers for the occasion. "If we clean off all those horrible chemicals and oil residue, scupper it a few hundred metres off the coast, and divert shipping routes around its resting place, then we'll have a nice, bustling reef within a few years! It really would be a poetic end for a weapon of war to become a bedrock of life."

4. "This old girl may not be battleworthy, but she's still a piece of naval history," gushes navy recruiter @@RANDOMNAME@@. "As a museum ship in harbour, this awe-inspiring battleship will amaze folk from far and wide. It will remind us of our history as a proud military power, show people how outmatched our foolish enemies were, and encourage young people to feel the patriotic call of duty."

[b][anchor=830]#830[/anchor]: Unreasonable Adjustments? [Dragude Sultanate; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
It's exam season, and the latest headlines report that a student registered as having dyslexia and dyscalculia received various adjustments due to @@HIS@@ disabilities. These included extra exam time, a scribe and a separate examination room. With the mounting cost of these adjustments and their perceived unfairness, interested parties have arrived at a public inquiry into the matter.

The Debate
1. "This kind of hand-holding is exactly what is making the next generation so stupid!" exclaims self-taught marine biologist @@RANDOMNAME@@. "I had to work hard to learn my trade without help from anyone. I kept on and persevered, much as the fearsome dolphin who knows that to stop swimming means death. Now they'll practically do the test for you as long as you have a doctor's note. I say we get rid of all this babying of our children and bring back survival of the fittest." Looking down at @@HIS@@ rotund frame, @@HE@@ quickly adds "or rather, survival of the smartest."

2. "That's absolutely absurd!" cries @@RANDOMNAME@@, parent of three autistic students. "Look at these test scores! Students with learning differences are still falling behind their peers even with these extra adjustments in exams. What we need to do is totally re-shape our entire education system from the ground up to make it more accommodating for everyone. What price would possibly be too high when it comes to unlocking the true potential of every @@DEMONYM@@?"

"Just send all of those... special children of yours to us and we'll set them up with workplace learning schemes in light manufacturing. It'll be a great way to build character, cut down on wage costs and teach the value of hard work! It's a win for the industry and the kids!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "Comrade, the revolution demands that each contribute according to their ability," intones @@RANDOMNAME@@, Party Undersecretary and part-time stamp collector. "If these children cannot demonstrate the abilities needed for rigorous academic study at the age of, say, ten or so then perhaps they would be better off preparing for a future in less mentally demanding roles on assembly lines or in the mines.

The Issue
A recent opinion survey carried out by the [i]@@LEADER@@ Fan Club[/i] has suggested that you are the most beloved and accomplished head of state in the history of @@NAME@@. They're suggesting that to celebrate this good news, a brand new public holiday would put the hoi polloi in even greater admiration of your glorious leadership.

The Debate
1. "Patriots Day!" exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, an excitable junior civil servant who carries a picture of you in @@HIS@@ wallet, and is always trying to get you to notice @@HIS@@. "The national anthem would be played all day long on TV and radio. There'd be carnivals in the streets showcasing our traditional clothes, dance, music and food. It will be fun for the kids too, as they can decorate their bicycles in the national colours of @@NAME@@ and win prizes for the best decorations. And looking over the festivities, a sixty-foot tall portrait of you, our most beloved leader!"

2. "A celebration isn't a bad idea, but you're looking at it from the wrong perspective," offers Army General and author of the book [i]Why Leader Is Our Greatest Strategic Asset[/i], @@RANDOMNAME@@. "An Armed Forces Day is what we need. Can you picture it now? A million armed men and women marching in perfect unison through the streets of @@CAPITAL@@, eyes right as they turn heads to salute you. Then, battalions of our newest armoured vehicles, followed by the best part: our biggest missiles on trailers. What a sight to behold! And all the civilians can be forced to be spectators; they wouldn't dare oppose that considering all the guns on show!"

[3]. "Public holidays have traditionally been of a religious nature," intones @@RANDOMNAME@@, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of @@CAPITAL@@. "Why don't we celebrate the holy moment of the creation of the world? Regardless of our faith, we can all agree that it is irrefutable that the hand of the divine was what set the universe in motion. Universe Creation Day is the holiday @@NAME@@ needs." [[color=blue]Religion is legal[/color]]

[4]. "Naked Truth Day!" yells the next speaker, who struts into your office totally naked, and stands directly in front of you without shame. Luckily, there is a framed photo of your parents on your desk that is located perfectly to avoid any offending sight. "We need a day when every citizen can be as free as Mother Nature intended. A day when you, @@LEADER@@, stand before us as if to say 'I have nothing to hide' and where we bask in joined consensual nakedness.

The Issue
Whistleblowers are claiming that internet video sharing website WhoTube has been censoring content distributed through their services that doesn't agree with the companies' political views.

The Debate
1. "This is blatant censorship!" exclaims Melania Kumar, known on WhoTube as [i]2Many_Big_Nosed_Bigtopians[/i]. "All I did was post a few videos explaining why I respectfully disagree with the political opinions of others, but out of the blue I was informed that I broke the terms of service and my channel was taken down. This abuse of censorship is killing free speech in this country."

2. "On the contrary, it's our right as a private enterprise to moderate our commercial property in whatever way we choose," claims Tarquin Rubin, a spokesperson for WhoTube. "Our terms of service state that we have a zero-tolerance policy for hate speech, and unfortunately for her, our moderators felt she violated that policy. Freedom of speech is about protection from government censorship and has nothing to do with how companies and people manage their private domains. The fact is, we have to look out for the interests of our advertising partners, if they pull their ads from our site we'll be hosed."

3. "WhoTube has the right idea banning hate speech," pipes-up Barack Adams, an activist for '@@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ Against Hatred'. "However, we must enforce that value on all levels of society. No more will we be stuck in the dark ages of intolerance and xenophobia, but instead we'll be working towards a new utopia for all people of every race, religion, identity, and background!"

4. "The problem is WhoTube has a virtual monopoly on online video sharing," moans your Minister of Public Endeavors Felicity Fox, while simultaneously rapidly typing on her laptop. "With competition, there could be ConservativeTube, LiberalTube, whatever. Everyone will be happy in their little echo-chambers. So just encourage new startups and enforce anti-monopoly measures against WhoTube. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a cat video that I need to finish editing."

The Issue
After encouraging your cabinet to be on social media, Twitcher use has exploded. In a recent controversial Twit, @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Finance Minister, posted that "Eckie-Ecola soda tastes like parrot urine." Since then, sales of Eckie-Ecola have gone flat and their stock prices have fizzled. The company is demanding an apology, and some on your staff are questioning the wisdom of all the social media usage.

The Debate
1."Millions in profits lost!" moans Eckie-Ecola CEO @@RANDOMNAME@@ while opening a can of soda and 'accidentally' spraying fizz on your favorite portrait of yourself. "Thanks to your Finance Minister's careless and totally wrong Twit, I've had to lay-off hundreds of workers. I demand an apology, on Twitcher, and compensation for my losses! In fact, I'll go one step further and request that all politicians refrain from making these kinds of remarks on social media. Surely you people have more important things to do, like, I don't know, running the nation?"

2."I hate to admit it, Leader, but, uh... the CEO does have a bit of a p... point," mumbles your junior aide @@RANDOMNAME@@, nervously clutching a short straw. "You and the Cabinet, uh... maybe DO spend a tiny bit too much time on social media. While the Twits are, of course, hysterical and incredibly informative, they might be a tiny bit of a distraction. I think it might be a good idea to uhh... b... b... ban politicians, or at least high-ranking officials, from having social media accounts. I mean, it's only a matter of time before one of them accidentally posts top-secret information online, right?"

3."Now hold on there!" defensively interrupts @@NAMEfromDescription@@, while simultaneously posting about the 'nasty' WhoTube comments section in @@HIS@@ latest Twit. "Social media is great for politicians! It helps us connect with the electorate in a way our parents and grandparents never thought possible!

4."You know, this whole social media thing has got me thinking," replies your Propaganda Minister, grinning from ear to ear. "You have hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitcher and MyFace, right? What if we used that to our advantage? Why not attack government critics more directly?

[b][anchor=834]#834[/anchor]: Government And CO [Nation of Quebec; ed:  Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Earlier this week, several people were sickened by carbon monoxide poisoning while waiting in a long line at a government office in downtown @@CAPITAL@@. Fortunately, nobody was killed, but the incident has prompted calls for the government to install carbon monoxide detectors in its buildings and better regulate safety standards.

The Debate
1. "The government should be thanking its lucky stars that there were no permanent injuries," notes government lawyer @@RANDOMNAME@@, relieved that nobody has decided to sue yet. "In order to abate public outcry, we need to make sure this doesn't happen again. We must install carbon monoxide detectors in every single government building in @@NAME@@, and provide government employees with the proper safety training. It may be a bit of an expense, but surely that beats a class action lawsuit, yes?"

2. "Why stop at government buildings? These detectors should be installed everywhere!" enthuses your worrywort Public Safety Minister, after checking the various detectors in your office. "We need to install these detectors in schools, places of business, and even people's homes. Carbon monoxide is a threat that needs to be taken seriously. Some people may not like this being mandatory, but safety knows no price tag. After all, people spend hundreds of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ on home security systems. The only thing that's different is that we're offering this free of charge."

3. "Oh, I'm sure this time the government will be able to fix another problem it created," sneers anti-government conspiracy theorist @@RANDOMNAME@@, setting off your sarcasm detector. "The last thing we need is the government going into people's homes and installing these things. For all we know you're planting listening devices in them! If the people want these detectors, they'll go out and buy them themselves. This is just government finding excuses to feed their own bloated bureaucracy. How about the government sticks its big nose out of things for once?"

4. "Sounds like the problem is the buildings, not some gas," chimes in contractor @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Have you seen the state of some of these buildings? The Public Affairs building is older than you are! We need to tear down these decrepit monstrosities and replace them with new technological marvels that can eliminate poisonous gasses before they're a threat! Will it be expensive and inconvenient? Yes, but think of how fancy and safe your new office will be!"

[b][anchor=835]#835[/anchor]: The End Is In Sight? [Candlewhisper Archive; ed:  Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The high-profile manhunt, capture, trial and conviction of @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ 'Cannibal' @@RANDOMLASTNAME_1@@ has been occupying news headlines for months, and now the serial slaughterer is finally scheduled to be executed. While most executions tend to have a few people in the viewing gallery, the notoriety of the infamous ingester of infants has demand for ringside seats at an all-time high.

The Debate
1. "I guess I wanna see with my own eyes that she's definitely dead and gone," explains mum-of-three @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, filling a carton with toffee-flavoured popcorn. "Also, it'd be so cool to tell the other school-mums that we saw the Cannibal die, they'll be totes jealous. My youngest has a day off nursery especially for this. I mean, I just think you should have a place with a proper viewing area so that more people can watch the big show."

2. "A baying crowd would lack a certain decorum," observes professional executioner @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Instead, why not have the execution broadcast live on television? Millions could tune in from their own homes, and you could double the entertainment value by having viewers vote on what novel method of execution should be used. It'd be fun to see @@LASTNAME_1@@ get dropped in a shark tank, or drowned in custard, or squashed by a giant plastic foot, don't you think?"

3. "The death penalty is a regrettable necessity, not an entertainment event," intones Judicial Review Officer @@RANDOMNAME@@, glaring sternly at you over @@HIS@@ gold-rimmed spectacles. "The public should be excluded from the process of judicial execution. The convicted soul, an executioner and a single medical witness - there's no need for anyone else in the room."

4. "Wait... we're not one of those loopy nations that have the death penalty, are we?" panics confused civil servant @@RANDOMNAME@@, checking through the legislation archive files to see what policies you've enacted in this hectic year. "That's some kind of error, right? Tell me that's an error!"

The Issue
The Citizens' Chapel Cultivation Concept, a radical religious movement frequently accused of being a cult, shocked the country today after they committed mass suicide in the rural village of @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@town. Two hundred and seventeen @@DEMONYNMPLURAL@@ are dead, including the cult's charismatic leader. The horrified public, including many relatives of the deceased, are urging you to prevent future atrocities.

The Debate
1. "How could the government let this happen?" cries @@RANDOMNAME@@, sobbing into an oversized handkerchief. "If the government had monitored this 'Citizens' Chapel Cultivation Concept', they'd have seen the lethal drug stockpile and my son would still be alive! The government must focus on defending its citizenry from wacko cults such as the Citizens' Chapel, even if it means state surveillance of every religious group in @@NAME@@!"

*2. "Heresy!" bellows @@RANDOMNAME@@, the Under-Poobah of the Order of Violet, donning a phlox purple top hat. "We cannot have unbelievers profaning our sacred spaces with their very presence. Sure, some wacky groups cite religion to commit atrocities, but those are the minority of religious sects! I demand - for all religious groups - absolute privacy from government encroachment!" [[color=blue]Violetism is legal[/color]]

*3. "Heresy! Or, you know, just plain unfair," gripes @@RANDOMNAME@@, the leader of the Tranquility of Yellow, donning a mellow yellow top hat. "We cannot have unbelievers profaning our sacred spaces with their very presence. It's not nice. Sure, some wacky groups cite religion to commit atrocities, but those are the minority of religious sects! I demand - for all religious groups - absolute privacy from government encroachment!" [[color=red]Violetism is illegal[/color]]

4. "You could have prevented this," announces journalist @@RANDOMNAME@@, scattering article drafts onto your desk. "I'd investigated the Citizens' Chapel for months. I had records of huge drug shipments, and sworn affidavits from former members testifying to @@lastnamefromoption1@@'s midnight muttering and purveying paranoia. I wrote to ask every department to stop the nutcase. But he kissed some junior ministers'... whatever, and nothing happened. To top it all, my stories were pulled - I was accused of persecuting him! If the government was expected to seriously investigate all concerns, those poor people might still be alive."

5. "We all know the real problem, and it won't be solved by turning this nation into some kind of police state," muses @@RANDOMNAME@@, the ethereal sister to one of the deceased, who is sporting a T-shirt that reads [i]Hugs Not Drugs[/i]. "The real problem isn't that some people have a different belief. Hey, live and let live, right? But when this @@lastnamefromoption1@@ guy started preaching 'heroic self-immolation', you let him get hold of all kinds of bad stuff. Sleeping pills, pain pills, potassium cyanide... You know. Not cool. If you, like, stopped selling substances that can kill people, we can all just go and live in peace."

The Issue
Auditors from the World Assembly have decided to pay a visit to assess how much @@NAME@@ should pay to fulfill its annual donation to the organization. The problem? The law regulating the donations operates as if it isn't voluntary, and the number they're quoting is causing your accountants to faint.

The Debate
1. "I know the language of the resolution says 'donation', but it's a mandatory donation. Here, look at the third definition from the top," asserts your Chief Legal Advisor, shoving a dusty, leatherbound book under your nose. "And there's all the legislative history from the debates… what isn't censored out, at least. We have a legal and moral obligation to obey international law. Besides, the last thing we want is to be noncompliant with the World Assembly. The repercussions would be unthinkable."

2. "How could a 'donation' possibly be mandatory?" snorts your Minister of Finance. "Pseudo-legal claptrap, if you ask me. Now, we can't break the law, obviously, but look at how many zeros there are in that number. A lot, that's how many. The law clearly needs a little tweak. Let's have our World Assembly ambassador write up a quick repeal and replacement. The international community couldn't possibly be opposed to some common-sense reform, right?"

3. "I think I have a solution for you, @@LEADER@@," whispers @@RANDOMNAME@@, President and CEO of the Agency for Creative Solutions. "These 'rules' about donations are really more like guidelines anyway. Look, if you change a few numbers in the books, they won't have anything to take. Here, we can just erase this zero… carry the seven… and now you're in the red! As long as no one looks too closely at the books, you probably won't suffer terrifying reprisals. In fact, we'll even do this one for free, if you make us your exclusive government accounting service." @@HE@@ smiles, showing far too many teeth. [???]

4. "Who gives an empty sack about 'international' law?" exclaims radical radio pundit @@RANDOMNAM@@, who just shouldered @@HIS@@ way into your office. "For too long the World Assembly and its bureaucratic gnomes have leeched off our glorious nation's hard work! They regulate our businesses into the ground with their child labor and environmental protection laws, involve themselves in our affairs with their feel-good anti-slavery legislation, and then they want us to empty the treasury into their bottomless bar tabs! Resign now and get rid of 'em all, I say!" @@HE@@ eyes up a nearby security guard's weapon. "By any means necessary." [???]

[b][anchor=838]#838[/anchor]: The Bark Knight Rises [Caracasus; ed:  Helaw][/b]

The Issue
The beloved comic book series [i]Dogman[/i] is set to mark its eightieth anniversary this year. A coalition of comic book aficionados, young and old, have gathered outside your office to decide how to best celebrate this achievement.

The Debate
1. "You know what I loved?" reminisces ageing general @@RANDOMNAME@@. "The war arc! Ha ha! Great fun to see Dogman giving those blighters from Blackacre what-for! That's the kind of patriotic hero our country should be celebrating. Make Dogman a symbol of patriotism and @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ supremacy, an icon of our strength! Our enemies will learn to truly fear our bark and our bite."

2. "You know, Dogman stands for a lot more than just beating up bad guys," counters @@RANDOMNAME@@, a well-known environmentalist and peace activist. "He shows children how important it is to take care of nature, and how kindness is the greatest superpower of all. Dogman-themed recycling bins and a positive ad campaign could be a great hit and really send out the right message."

3. "Dogman is all very well, and a good role model for boys, but what about the girls?" asks renowned newspaper columnist @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Why don't we use this to celebrate some of the famous women in the comics? After all, Dogman's long-term love interest donned the mantle of Weasel Lady for four whole issues whilst Dogman was in hospital after his battle with Irritant Flower."

4. "Hah! That run of comics was so full of inconsistencies it would be funny if it weren't so tragic," sneers comic book enthusiast and self-proclaimed expert on Dogman, @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Quite apart from anything else, The Bamboozler's machine was destroyed in issue 242, yet somehow he manages to bring it back to mortally wound Dogman in a later issue. And a normal human that is somehow able to don the sacred Weasel Lady mantle? Worst storyline ever! Let's at least make this celebration somewhat balanced. I have a long list here of the various inconsistencies in the series for your speech..."

5. "You know these comics are bull, right?" says Jamie Logan, former vigilante and one of six men who has fought crime on the streets under the mantle of Dogman in the past century. "Maybe a quarter of it happened, and not like this. In the real world, people die, and no dude in a leotard can stop that. Adults shouldn't read superhero comics. Force them to grow up, and drag them back to face reality." He stares moodily at the cloudy sky, waiting for the Dogsignal.

[b][anchor=839]#839[/anchor]: "Partisanship Too Far?" Wrongly Asks Opposition [Ransium; ed:  Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
After a recent incident where a lifeguard refused to save a drowning swimmer because she thought he looked like he belonged to another political party, talking heads on cable TV have seized upon the moment to ask if the current partisan political tensions in @@NAME@@ have gotten out of control.

The Debate
1. "Clearly the root of the problem is the media capitalizing on existing tensions for monetary gain," argues frequent cable TV pundit @@RANDOMNAME@@, unfazed by the chagrined frown of the show's host. "We need to put rules in place so the media cannot be so blatantly partisan and negative in its reporting of political news stories..."

2. "That's precisely the sort of dangerous idiocy your party would advocate!" shouts host @@RANDOMNAME@@, cutting off @@HISfromOption1@@ attempts to talk. "People just need a little incentive to break through their bubbles and see the other side as people too. Give a small tax break to people based on how many of their MyFace friends have different political views, and I'm sure all this partisan hullabaloo will be gone overnight."

[3]. As the program quickly cuts to an ad-break, a soothing, over-cheerful voice caresses your ears. "Looking for love, friendship, and happiness?" On screen, a cascade of fizzy Eckie-Ecola is poured into a glass, ice cubes clinking. "Pop the can, and feel all the love you can! Nothing brings you closer together than Eckie-Ecola." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color] AND [color=blue]Advertizing is legal[/color]]

4. "I don't see what the problem is," notes your aide, turning off your TV. "In fact, I say we enhance partisan identification by designating what colors people can wear based on their political affiliation. Then you'll immediately know who is working to better the country, and who only has morally bankrupt and wrongheaded ideas."
