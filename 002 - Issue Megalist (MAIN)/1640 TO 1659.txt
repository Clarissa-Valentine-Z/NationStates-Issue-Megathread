[b][anchor=1640]#1640[/anchor]: See No Evil [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
When social media influencer @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ filmed @@HIM_1@@self throwing furniture off a 45th-floor balcony onto the streets below, it was widely agreed that this was a criminally dangerous and irresponsible thing to do and that @@HE_1@@ deserved it when @@HE_1@@ was subsequently arrested and imprisoned. However, @@HIS_1@@ WhoTube and Instasnap accounts have been thriving, with almost ten times as many subscribers as before, and there's talk about @@HIS_1@@ "bad @@BOY_1@@" image being used to advertise some of the edgier corporate brands.

The Debate
1. "What sort of lesson are we teaching if we allow people to profit from abhorrent actions?" writes journalist Daly Maille, author of a highly rated tabloid opinion column. "We ought to be ordering social media companies to shut down @@HIS_1@@ accounts, and any future immoral earnings gained from criminal notoriety should be seized by the government. That'll teach these attention-seekers that you can't get rich through infamy, and the extra cash for the @@TYPE_INITIALS@@@@NAME_INITIALS@@ Treasury will keep income taxes low for hard-working decent folk like you and me!"

2. "It's not @@HIS_1@@ fault if people have an unhealthy interest in criminal behaviour," observes celebrity management agent Baxter Scratch, holding up a copy of the offender's new book 'Why I Did It'. "No-one is condoning @@HIS_1@@ actions, least of all the repentant offender @@HIM_1@@self. In fact, we've got plans to stream a new vlog where @@HE_1@@'ll wrestle with @@HIS_1@@ foolish past, and reflect on how society brought @@HIM_1@@ there. We just need you to tell prisons to relax their regulations about inmates accessing social media, and we can turn offenders like @@HIM_1@@ into a positive force for change."

3. "I agree that this very attractive nineteen-year-old is probably as much a victim in this scenario as anyone else," adds your partially sighted uncle, tucking a press-release photo of the offender into his pocket for later examination. "In fact, the furniture-throwing video was a real and vibrant expression of youthful rebellion. We should encourage more good-looking young folk to do wild and crazy things on video. I could certainly stand to watch more of this sort of thing, and it'd likely be great for the furniture restoration industry."

[b][anchor=1641]#1641[/anchor]: Freedom of Depress [Adomnar; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
An evening celebrating the nation's favourite felines was somewhat marred by the repeated airing of intensely depressing advertisements for a cat welfare charity, showing shocking images of mistreated, melancholic and mutilated moggies.

The Debate
1. "No organization has the right to emotionally blackmail our good @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ households with these traumatic images!" cries miffed mother @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, cradling her weeping nineteen-year-old son in her arms. "No child of mine ought to see those awful scenes, like that poor amputee kitten who'd been used as a basketball. I shouldn't be manipulated into giving up my hard-earned @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in this way. Please, for the sake of our families, you must restrict any advertisements with potentially scarring, emotionally taxing imagery!"

2. "Pah! Another weeping snowflake offended at everything," responds the charity's CEO, holding up an elderly tomcat with no eyes. "You don't see Ole Tom here crying, do you? His last owner saw to that! If you want to send a message... you can't hold back. They're always telling us to tip-toe around 'sensibility' guidelines. Animals will continue to suffer and die if you don't loosen all these 'obscenity' and 'misinformation' laws. Do you want this poor pregnant cat's death on your hands?"

[b][anchor=1642]#1642[/anchor]: When Push-itzer Comes to Shove [Southland; ed: Klaus Devestatorie][/b]

The Issue
This year, the committee for the internationally prestigious Pushitzer Prize has named a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizen as one of the small handful of winners! Regrettably, in what was clearly a deliberate attempt to highlight @@NAME@@'s human rights record, the award was given to imprisoned playwright and dissident @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, for "promoting peace throughout @@REGION@@ with @@HIS_1@@ transformative writing".

The Debate
1. "This is a blatant insult!" hisses head of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Homeland Intelligence @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ 'Snakes Eyes' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, whose agency is currently detaining @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@. "Of all our top authors and poets they could have chosen, they went with this traitorous filth? Well, we're not playing that game!" Setting @@HIS@@ baton to "tenderize", @@HE@@ continues, "Give me five minutes alone with @@HIM_1@@ and I'll 'convince' our friend to decline the award, and then I'll pay a visit to @@HIS_1@@ friends, family, and writers guild tonight to make sure they all fall in line. After all, what are those pompous bleeding hearts going to do, write an angry letter?"

2. "THAT'S NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH!" roars "The Lion of the Plains", General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is currently being restrained by your advisors from smashing a valuable ivory statuette in a mad rage. "This grave insult to our character requires a MILITARY touch! Send our best black ops team to follow these scumbags and force them to rescind the award. If they still refuse, hunt them like the dogs they are! They'll think twice about ever insulting us again."

3. "Let's not get carried away," mutters your eagle-eyed Propaganda Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, underlining passages in the prize's press release for future use. "It's true that the prize committee has slighted us by nominating that transgressor over more deserving citizens, but coerced rejections and assassinations will only vindicate their accusations. What we need is a slick media blitz highlighting the Pushitzer's history of bias and hypocrisy, ending with you announcing our own award recognizing @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ achievements. It will take a bite out of our budget to pull off, but hopefully it will grant us sympathy with our allies across @@REGION@@."

*4. "Is it really that bad?" squeaks your mousy staff member @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hastily hiding a suspicious book from your line of sight. "I may disagree with the views of @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, who's-definitely-a-bad-guy-don't-get-me-wrong, but this is a monumentally prestigious award. The other suggestions will make us look bad. I think we can briefly let @@HIM_1@@ out of prison and let @@HIM_1@@ travel just to get the award, accompanied by our escort and with @@HIS_1@@ acceptance speech pre-vetted first of course, as a gesture of goodwill. And maybe we can… uhh…" @@HE@@ quivers under the unblinking glower of the General. "Maybe we can listen to @@HIM_1@@ and relax the laws… a little?"
