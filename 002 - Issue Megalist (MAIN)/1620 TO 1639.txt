[b][anchor=1620]#1620[/anchor]: Ballooning Out of Proportions [Cha-os; ed: Kaschovia][/b]

The Issue
Your latest meeting with industry executives on soaring helium import prices is suddenly interrupted by reports of a gigantic white balloon floating fifteen kilometres in the sky over @@NAME@@. Quite worryingly, it appears to be hovering over a classified missile containment facility.

The Debate
1. "It's those damned devils from Dàguó again!" curses your bullish Secretary of Defense @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shoving @@HIS@@ way into your office. "It's always them... this is an unacceptable assault on our sovereignty and we cannot let it slide! Say, if they're so curious about our superior weapons arsenal, I have a Mach 23 Dragonbreath surface-to-air missile primed and ready to blow that blasted balloon to smithereens! It's about time we took back control of our own airspace, don't you think, @@LEADER@@?"

2. "Yes, our intelligence strongly suggests it is them..." confirms your Minister of Domestic Security @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pointing an arbitrarily long stick at an unrelated map. "Sure, they might have acquired some blurry images of one military facility with this balloon, but should we really be wasting millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ firing missiles at it? We reserve the right to respond to their acts of espionage, and we should — by launching our own fleet of cutting-edge spy balloons back at them! Who knows what they've been hiding in those mountains?"

3. The Dàguó hotline rings and your secretary puts it on speaker mode. "Oh @@LEADER@@, we are very sorry for this very unexpected turn of affairs! It's just the wind — you know, such blasted wind. This is not a spy balloon, but actually an oversized gender reveal balloon... Yes! It's a gender reveal to celebrate the coming birth of our prince — or princess — we don't know yet! We humbly ask that you clear your airspace for the balloon to continue on its course, so it may safely arrive in Dàguó where we will burst it at the palace of the Celestial Emperor. Once again, we are very sorry!"

The Issue
The government's hard-line ban on cars and planes has drawn criticism in the aftermath of an emergency landing of a space shuttle that left the @@NAME@@ Space Agency with no other recourse than to collect the shuttle via a convoy of horse-drawn buggies.

The Debate
1. "It's just not practical," gripes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of @@NAME_INITIALS@@SA, who reeks of something nasty. "We put together these multi-billion @@CURRENCY@@ missions, and when they're over, we collect the shuttle with horse-drawn carriages. With luck, we can drag it to an existing rail system or port, but if not, we drag the whole damn thing back by buggy! If we're really committed to our space program, we need to reconsider the ban on automobiles and aeroplanes — surely we can at least make an exception for an essential government program like this. It's about time we get off our high horses and start thinking of the places we could go!"

*2. "Hold on, we can get creative here," interjects Xenon Trust, the eccentric CEO of spacecraft developer StarY, confidently striding in wearing a jetpack that looks like something your niece made for her fifth birthday. "Taking things places with... minimal explosiveness... is the literal mission of spacecraft. When we shoot for the Moon, we should be able to land back safely and precisely where we want in @@NAME@@! Listen — my company has pioneered very well-tested, proprietary rocket tech that'll give your vessels the ability to safely re-enter orbit and land anywhere without the usual rough landings. Pair that with my smart, ambitious, and very expansive project to place landing sites in safe zones all over the country and we won't have to worry about future catastrophes!"

"Those gas-spewing satellites and rockets need to go the way of the plane, car, and dodo. If they emit exhaust, they gotta go. We've come this far; one more tiny push and we can be the most environmentally friendly nation in @@REGION@@! Imagine that, right? So what if people have to walk everywhere? Everyone needs to slow down and take in the beauty anyway."

[b][anchor=1622]#1622[/anchor]: Border Burden [Ostrovskiy, Giovanniland; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
The border between Bigtopia and @@NAME@@has long been a messy one, with several so-called 'pene-exclaves' — @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ lands that can only be effectively accessed by passing through Bigtopia's territory, and vice-versa. This challenge, brought on by the mountainous terrain, has been brought to the fore by an unexpected letter from Bigtopia's ambassador.

The Debate
1. The messenger bearing the letter bows deeply, and presents the document for your perusal. It reads, "@@LEADER@@, these pene-exclaves negatively affect the lives of both our nations' citizens, who often have to deal with border crossings and bureaucracy to fulfill their basic needs. They also cost a fortune to administer. On behalf of my nation, I propose we exchange these lands so that there will no longer be territories that can only be accessed by crossing a border. The affected citizens of each nation can then choose between moving to a new location in their home country, or beginning the citizenship process where they are."

2. "Do we even care about these lands?" questions avaricious Minister of the Economy @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pointing at a map with scorn. "Only a few thousand @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ live there, yet we pay the high price of having to provide services. Did you know that their annual per capita tax revenue is only half the national average? If Bigtopia wants these areas, let it buy them off us and take care of the residents themselves, along with the ones in their own exclaves! We get a bit of cash, and it'll allow the use of taxpayer money for better purposes, like lining our pockets... err, I mean focusing on the more prosperous parts of the country."

3. "Are you insane? Think about our citizens!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Foreign Affairs, who passed through three border checkpoints on the way to work today. "They'd have to give up their ancestral land in order to stay with us, or else suddenly wake up in a different country! Why don't we just sign a mutual free border agreement with Bigtopia? If you live in an exclave, you'll be able to travel without a visa to and from the mainland, and services such as the fire and police departments would be allowed to cross the border too. I'm sure we can trust that their citizens won't exploit this to gain access to other parts of @@NAME@@." @@HE@@ shakes the hand of the Bigtopian messenger, and quietly dismisses them.

4. "Is that Bigtopian rascal gone yet? Splendid! The elephant in the room is that we allow a weak nation like Bigtopia to push us around!" scoffs Minister of War @@RANDOM_NAME@@, tearing the letter and throwing it in the trash. "Why would we want to sign deals with them or sell our land? A far easier solution would be to intimidate Bigtopia into ceding the travel corridors we want! Run a series of military exercises along the borders where @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ need to cross, and inform those big-noses that we need freedom to move our troops back and forth to the exclaves for our own national security. See if we can get control of their exclaves too, to smooth this mess of a border."[/box]

[b][anchor=1623]#1623[/anchor]: The @@MAN_1@@ in the Iron Lung [Jutsa; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
@@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ was given a medical ventilator in place of lungs, a hemodialysis machine in place of kidneys, and an artificial heart, all while suffering from paralysis, amnesia, and a wicked hangnail. Hospital administrators are concerned that this is just one of many cases where these limited resources could've been used to help people more likely to recover to a normal life. Your aides arranged a hospital visit to discuss this matter and score a few brownie points.

The Debate
1. "This one @@MAN_1@@ — who is barely even alive at this point — is costing @@NAME@@ a fortune," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of the Northwest @@NAME@@ Hospital Fund while reading from a suspiciously ornate clipboard. "Despite @@HIS_1@@ urge to stay alive, we think it's best for everyone if we pull the plug. Yes, it sounds cruel, but the resources would be better spent saving many more lives. Please, let us euthanize patients in conditions like these."

2. "N-nooo...I... grandchildren... nooo..." whimpers the faint old voice of @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ before @@HE_1@@ passes out. @@HIS_1@@ nurse steps in after dispensing some hand sanitizer. "It is @@HIS_1@@ wish to live, and it should be our job to see to it @@HE_1@@ lives. Are we really putting a price on someone's life? We can reallocate government funds from other departments, especially the military, to take care of our citizens. We need more life and less death."

3. "We wouldn't have this problem if only patients who are willing and able to pay up got treatment," argues a @@MAN@@ in a three-piece suit who seems determined to stay as far away from everyone in the room as possible. "We shouldn't babysit those who haven't worked hard enough, or spent all their money on Pear Phones and avocado toast. If they can't afford it, they should have made better decisions when they were healthy.  We need to ditch the universal healthcare system and only treat people who can pay. It takes care of our limited resource problem. Win-win."

The Issue
@@CAPIPTAL@@'s railway system has come under fire recently after relatives were allowed to ship their deceased family member in a baggage car.

The Debate
1. "Surely you can't object to what we did?" asks the dead @@MAN@@'s sibling, looking strangely at ease considering @@HIS@@ recent loss. "Our parents wanted her buried in the family plot back home... and that's a fair trek by horse and cart. The government should stay out of our business and let dead people on trains! So what if I put her in a mail bag? Coffins aren't cheap, you know."

2. "You can't let this happen," weeps traumatized city worker @@RANDOMNAME@@, who wasn't on that train, and who hasn't actually ever been on a train. "It's surely upsetting to be forced to witness death up-close! Not to mention it must smell horrible, and is probably unhygienic. You must ban the transport of corpses in trains used by the general public!"

3. "There's always a compromise to be had," whispers @@RANDOMNAME@@, your pallid Minister for Transportation, touching your shoulder softly as @@HE@@ leans to your ear. "Many people have good reasons to transport dead bodies from one place to another, but not everybody is as comfortable with them as you or I. So we simply fund a separate train system. A train for the dead — in funeral colours — headed for the final destination."

[b][anchor=1625]#1625[/anchor]: At What Price? [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A recent trend has had journalists asking members of your cabinet mundane questions, like how much a carton of milk costs, to see if they are out of touch with everyday life.

The Debate
1. "I haven't researched the exact figures, but I expect milk is expensive nowadays — certainly more than the poorest in society can afford," prevaricates your Welfare Minister, dodging the question as usual. "That's why we must commit to raising welfare payments for those in the lowest income brackets. Because we care." @@HE@@ turns to the camera and gives @@HIS@@ best earnest-but-sympathetic look.

2. "Last I heard, milk prices are too low, probably. Definitely not enough to support our dairy farmers," complains your Minister of Agriculture. "Supermarkets are underpaying powerless dairy farmers who can barely cover the cost of production. Regulation is needed for a fair minimum wholesale price. Let consumers and retailers carry the cost burden, not the milk producers!"

3. "I think milk is relatively cheap at point of delivery, but in terms of environmental externalities it costs far too much," lectures your Environment Minister, who sources her oat-almond-mung bean mylk blend from a refill shop at 4 @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ per 100 grams of CO2. "Dairy herds, and animals in general, are hugely inefficient in kilojoule-per-hectare indices, and bovine burps produce a lot of greenhouse gases. We need to transition to pure arable farming, and pure veganism."

4. "Oh, do you mean Damien Emin's piece [i]A Carton of Milk Left on the Counter Overnight[/i]?" enthuses your Culture Minister. "3.5 million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ at auction, if I recall. You know, we ought to be subsidising art and artists more, to encourage more modern art of this quality. I mean sure, the milk stinks a bit, but only literally."

5. "We're missing the point here, which is that 92.5% of your ministers really are out of touch," complains civil servant Vicky Pedia, who is a veritable goldmine of unverified statistics. "What you need is mandatory earpieces for every minister, with a fully staffed fact-finding team on call ready to relay them a perfect answer they need as soon as they get asked any tough question."

[b][anchor=1626]#1626[/anchor]: Wiggle Room [West Barack and East Obama; ed: Westinor][/b]

The Issue
A curious new weight loss fad has wormed its way into the world of fat slimming in @@NAME@@ — deliberate self-infection with tapeworms.

The Debate
1. "Tapeworm therapy is revolutionary!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the procurers of this peculiar slimming aid, whilst squirming in @@HIS@@ seat and clutching @@HIS@@ stomach. "These days, the disadvantaged amongst us just don't have the time or money for balanced diets or physical exercise. But with some help from a little buddy in our tummies who can take in all the extra calories we consume, we can look beautiful once more. You should definitely promote these methods to the public! Of course, some people are going to develop a couple of... complications here and there, but what medicine doesn't have side effects? Also, unrelated question: do you happen to know where the nearest toilet is?"

2. "Let's not open this can of worms too hastily," cautions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a nerdy researcher from prominent pharmaceutical company Mhizer, as @@HE@@ flips through a thick clipboard containing colourful charts and coffee stains. "There's been plenty of research into the risks and rewards of using tapeworms to lose weight, and there's a pretty clear conclusion — it sucks, and we're not referring to lost body weight. But, guess what? Thanks to rigorous trials conducted by yours truly, Mhizer's approved weight loss pills can help you burn up to 10% of your body fat in a year without too much risk! It's true, many consumers can't afford conventional methods of losing weight, so you should subsidise the production of our wonder pills to give everyone the equal opportunity they deserve."

3. "You've all lost your damn minds," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Health, as @@HE@@ shoves a couple of nauseating images of patients' intestines in your face. "Weight loss pills can be harmful if used improperly, and worms? Hello, diarrhea, vomit, stomach pain? Are you kidding me? Yet people still get conned into thinking that these extreme health risks are worth it to lose a few kilos. These scams have gone too far. Arrest both of these psychos and prohibit their products at once!"

[b][anchor=1627]#1627[/anchor]: Snow Days on Thin Ice [Obets; ed: Kaschovia][/b]

The Issue
After a school district in western @@NAME@@ reported twenty centimeters of snow following a monstrous blizzard, students in the region are in uproar as the local education board has set up virtual classes for the kids instead of calling the day off.

The Debate
1. "Oh, this is going to be great!" rejoices Western @@NAME@@ School District Superintendent @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ barges into your office and kicks off @@HIS@@ snow boots. "With all of these technological advancements, no student will ever need to miss a day of school again! Say your goodbyes to snow days and sick days... heck, we should ban all days off school and require that every district offer accessible online classrooms. "

2. "You can't do that to us!" objects student rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, standing proud at the front of @@HIS@@ school posse. "You have to understand @@LEADER@@, there's nothing better than getting that school cancellation email when heavy snow is forecast and our weary bones need a rest from the elements. Just do away with all of this virtual school stuff and let us kids enjoy some time off for once."

3. "I'm afraid I must agree with the child..." says professional optometrist and personal healthcare expert Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wiping frost from @@HIS@@ vintage frames. "In fact, we could take it a step further. If we allow these virtual classes, nearsightedness in children will skyrocket, further fuelling the worrying rise in myopia rates across @@NAME@@. What do you expect to happen when people are glued to their screens all day? Not only should we forbid all online classes, we should also put strict regulations on the screen time of children throughout the nation. Twenty-minutes ought to be more than enough!"

*4. "Everyone calm down, I clearly have the best solution," smirks self-accredited tech-wizard and startup CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Not only could we have virtual school on snow days, we could have virtual school, like, basically all of the time, you know? With the proprietary software developed in the online education industry, students will be able to work from the comfort of their own homes without ever needing to trek through a blizzard to class again. Furthermore, you should subsidize online teaching platforms like mine and allow students to choose between in person and online attendance. It will cost a lot of money, but, well... we can't possibly put a price on quality education for the next generation now, can we?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

[b][anchor=1628]#1628[/anchor]: NEET Freaks? [Electrum; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A recent study has found that there are a significant number of young @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ who have withdrawn from society completely. This phenomenon, known overseas as [i]hikikomori[/i], is associated with extreme social isolation and refusal of almost any interaction outside of the internet.

The Debate
1.  "There are a lot of reasons why someone could end up friendless and isolated," pointedly observes psychologist @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, as you recline on @@HIS_1@@ chaise longue. "These social isolates have a multitude of mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety and internet addiction. These all make it perfectly understandable for them to want to stay at home rather than facing the outside world. A well-funded program of active intervention will solve this issue: regular visits from psychologists, counseling for the whole family and mandatory social activities to get the hikikomori to leave their homes."

2. "Ten-hut!" screams Drill Sergeant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while barging into the room with a battering ram. "I'll tell you why these useless little maggots won't leave their home — their coddling parents enable them! Why would these freaks ever feel the need to leave their house when mummy and daddy provide for their every need? Bah, it disgusts me. Call in the troops to forcibly remove these loners and send them to my boot camp for a week or three. Don't you worry, we're going to whip them into shape."

3. "In the enlightened state of Dàguó, they've limited youths to three hours of videogames per week, and only on Fridays and Saturdays," observes Minister of Youth Maria Poppings, encouraging you to take some time from your office to go fly a kite. "Of course, to enforce such measures we'll need all games to only be playable whilst online, with mandatory age verification, online activity tracking and a ban on VPNs. We'd better get straight to it, spit spot!"

4. "Hell is other people," notes Jean-Pascal Montmartre, one of @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@'s clients who is peering through the space where the door once was. "Throughout your time as leader, have you enjoyed every single interaction with your citizens? I don't think so. You can probably see why many people don't want to leave their homes at all. These people are off the streets and stay out of trouble; instead of shaming them we should be lauding their example and encouraging others to do the same. Requiring employers to enable working from home, subsidising delivery services and upgrading internet networks will allow people to live their lives with minimal human contact."
