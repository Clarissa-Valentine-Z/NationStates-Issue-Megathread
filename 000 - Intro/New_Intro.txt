[size=150]Greetings, [b]**SPOILER ALERT**[/b]

This thread is to keep track of all issues in NationStates.

Feel free to contribute, yourself, if you find an issue! Just copy/paste all of the text, the title, the issue number, the author, and the editor. :D[/size][/align]
[spoiler=Tips on how to make it easier on me - and help us all in the instance of 5. Note you do not have to do any of these things.][box]1) Remove the "ACCEPT"s, and "DISMISS".
2) Place the number, name, author and editor above the rest of the issue as such: [b]#(number): (name) [(author); ed: (editor)][/b]
3) Replace things such as your capital, religion, leader, nation, currency, animal, person, people, adjective, etc. with the macros below; please keep onto names, though.
4) Try to keep [i]italics[/i]; they're tricky, I know, but if you feel like going the extra mile, please do keep them.

5) Right click every "accept" button and click "inspect". You should find this in the upper-right box:
[i]<button type="submit" name="choice-#" value="1" class="button big icon approve">Accept</button>"[/i]
In place of [i]#[/i] is the option number minus one: So, "choice-0" is option 1, "choice-1" is option 2, etc.
If you could report these before each option, you'd greatly help us identify if there are any alternative options,
though it is not a necessity if you can't figure it out or feel lazy. :)[/box][/spoiler]

[i]Note: Don't go too crazy. You don't want to get too ambiguous - though, from what I hear, editors love ambiguity more than most people.[/i]

Also, some options have varients or are not available to certain nations. Here's a quick legend to help you out:

[TEXT] appears at the end of some options, and states the validity:
- [[color=red]Red text[/color]] means something is banned, mandatory, or more authoritarian.
- [[color=blue]Blue text[/color]] indicates something is legal and/or freer.
- [[color=purple]Purple text[/color]] is for relatively neutral standpoints, like whether you have a military, a capital, a faith, or are a matriarchy/patriarchy.

* before a number indicates two or more options are variants. Multiple *s indicate different sets (i.e. * does not go with **)
[Number] indicates that the option has no variant, but still is not available for all nations who get the issue.
