[b][anchor=480]#480[/anchor]: One Nation's Trash Is Another Nation's Trash [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A collection of fishermen's unions have besieged the capitol with rubbish, all of which was caught during fishing expeditions. The fishermen claim they catch more novelty singing bass than actual fish in their nets, because the nation routinely dumps its waste in international waters.

The Debate
1. "Clean up your act, @@LEADER@@; these heaps of Mad Max vs. Jar Jar Binks 2 DVDs are just the tip of the iceberg!" hollers @@RANDOMNAME@@, an impoverished fisherman. "If you think all this rubbish obstructing your office view is bad, you should see what it's like in the ocean. The fish are being killed off by makeshift continents of plastic and styrofoam and off-brand Jack Michaelson matryoshka dolls. @@NAME@@ needs to store its waste in landfills like other nations do, or we won't have a fishing industry to speak of!"

2. "I agree with the fishermen," quietly says @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Environmental Minister, whom you've never noticed before. "But let's actually help Mother Earth this time round. Give my ministry a blank check for once, and then we can restructure our waste disposal towards recycling and cleaning up all that waste floating in the South @@ANIMAL@@ Sea."

3. "Are we going to let some foreigners tell us what to do?" asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, an excessively patriotic citizen. "Our country is cleaner than ever! Never before has our glorious nation been so pristine! We should keep taking out our trash into the ocean, where it hurts no true @@DEMONYMNOUN@@. And if people still complain about the international waste dumping, why don't we cast the whiners into the sea too?"

4. "There's a better way," claims a woman who will only identify herself as the Captain, while welding a blender to a rusty supermarket trolley. "I have an idea for a TV show. Give teams of contestants ten hours to build crazy contraptions with rubbish fished out of the sea, and the winning team gets a free boat! I call it the Scrapsea Challenge. Sure, it won't have a meaningful impact on the nautical pollution levels, but it will globally broadcast that @@NAME@@ is doing something for Mother Earth. Kind of. That publicity is worth a little government support, is it not?"

[b][anchor=481]#481[/anchor]: Social Equality Reaching Embarrassing Levels [Czechostan; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
Income gaps in @@NAME@@ have become so tiny that the paychecks of @@MAJORINDUSTRY@@ CEOs barely surpass that of their secretaries. While some decry this as a sign of the end of days, others hail it as the beginning of something great.

The Debate
1. "You are effectively killing @@NAME@@," bemoans Ayn Bland, homespun philosopher and author of the long forgotten novel 'The Fountain Pen'. "Our most prominent minds are barely making more than average second-handers. There is no incentive to work your way up, and if we continue like this I guarantee that productivity will plummet and creativity and ingenuity will be a thing of the past. The government needs to stop forcing businesses to pay their workers such similar wages, cut taxes, and abolish any and all welfare. Only then will our prime movers flourish and the common plebeians put forth their best effort."

2. "What is this I hear about some citizens making more than others? Everybody is a winner and all must have prizes!" shouts @@RANDOMNAME@@, obscure anthropologist and author of absurdist children's books. "Every last man and woman should be paid the same amount of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@. This must be our #1 goal. My studies of the Dodo tribe in East Lebatuck clearly shows that complete equality of outcome promotes and nurtures stability, compassion and harmony within the community. The government needs to make sure that everybody is awarded their exact share of our common riches."

3. "Equality without direction or purpose is just useless moralism," bluntly states Karl Sparx, a first-year economy student. "For the time being, we should pay people based on their contribution to the social product. The same amount you give to society, the same amount you shall receive in return. It's the only rational way to promote productivity. Yes, my plan will entail less income equality in the short run, but a blissful paradise of abundance and workers' comradery in the Glorious People's Republic of @@NAME@@ once we progress from the lower phases! Oh, did I forget to mention that this is contingent on you nationalizing all industry in the name of the proletariat? Well, yeah, you need to do that."

4. "Good points, terrible solution," declares @@RANDOMNAME@@, one of your Bigtopian consultants, a strong proponent of the increasingly popular 'Third Wheel' approach to economic policy. "Some genuine income disparity could really help you promote growth, but you don't want come across all insensitive and harsh. Maybe a way out of this is a little rebranding? Roll back wage regulations and reprioritize funds from welfare and social policy to education and business, while simultaneously stressing that the government values equality of opportunity above outcome. You'll come across as a modern and socially responsible leader, while saving money and stimulating the economy. There, problem solved. As for my fee, should I send you a bill, or do you prefer cash up front?"

5. "Some people do deserve to be paid more than others..." opines a local bus driver. "We should pay people progressively, based on how important their jobs truly are to the @@TYPE@@ and its citizens. Trust me, a bus driver knows these things; I've seen them all and can tell you what they're really worth. Like bus drivers, for instance. I'm responsible for hundreds of peoples life's every day, from downtown @@CAPITAL@@ across 110th street. Or the people looking after your kids all day, the little old lady making jam for our toasts. Those are the true heroes of @@NAME@@, and they should be paid accordingly."

[b][anchor=482]#482[/anchor]: Whose Fault Is It Anyways? [Eaischpnaeieacgkque Bhcieaghpodsttditf; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
After a frantic and disgruntled couple set the record for most domestic violence complaints in a single month, people have begun to reconsider the nation's uncompromising opposition to divorce.

The Debate
1. "Get your dirty hands off my kids!" screams @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@ while strangling her husband. "I never want to see you ever again! @@LEADER@@, all that I want is to divorce my idiotic husband for ... reasons I won't explain. I demand that you legalize divorce so I can get rid of this scumbag once and for all. Hold still dear, my hands are slipping."

2. "Arghhh! Get your hands off my throat!" croaks her husband while frantically trying to escape his wife's grasp. "Of course you're gonna bring up that instance with your sister. I only did that because of what you did with my brother!" The man catches his breath, then continues, "@@LEADER@@, my shrew of a wife fails to recognize the real problem. The government is doing nothing to help strained couples stay together. Marriage counseling needs to be free, for the sake of families across @@NAME@@. Any problem can be solved with enough... arghh! Get off me!"

3. "Matrimony is a sacred union that cannot be broken," intones your grandmother, @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, reciting holy texts. "What would happen to spouses if we allowed them to separate? How do you explain to children that their parents no longer love each other? And you mustn't forget that divorce tears families apart every day in godless Bigtopia and Marche Noire. So even if the romance ended a long time ago in a marriage, couples must remain faithful, for which they will be rewarded in the afterlife."

4. "You know, this all could have easily been prevented," states Will Eye the Science Guy, after petitioning for state funds to build a doomsday device. "Scientific advancements in @@NAME@@ have made it possible for us to give all people compatibility tests to determine exact matches for their future spouses. Assuming the tests are administered perfectly, marital strife will be a thing of the past. The only people that could possibly want a divorce would be those who lied on the test, and we have ways to know if they are lying." At this, he rubs his hands together and laughs maniacally.

[b][anchor=483]#483[/anchor]: Do You Want Fries With That? [The rejected realms issue committee; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
Mobs of disgruntled employees picket fast-food chains across @@NAME@@, tossing cheeseburgers at customers and burning their uniforms – all in the name of dignity and fairer wages.

The Debate
1. "MERRY MEALS, MERRY WORKERS!" chants a pubescent protester. "For far too long have our families starved because of pitiful wages. I mean, really, what are we supposed to do with one @@CURRENCY@@ a day? Eat it!? @@NAME@@ needs to set a new minimum floor for wages, and protect workers – the least that can go wrong is a little bump in the price of your Big Max - what's the big deal?"

2. "Oh the horror! THE HORROR!" gasps the McRonald's CEO as he watches a video of protesters deep-frying the company mascot. "Not Ronald! Anyone but Ronald! They've gone bananas! @@LEADER@@, their complaints are ridiculous, I assure you. They should be grateful for the wage they get for, what, flipping a few burgers? Give me a break. I implore you to send in the police and stop these mouth-breathers from scaring away our custom- eh, I mean, to protect our citizens, of course..."

3. "The problem isn't wages, darling," says a 'chatty cathy' working the counter at Papa Pallocci's Pizza Pagoda. "It's all the 'part time' hours - the 'seasonal' work, 'overtime', 'no overtime', 'zero-contracts' – before you know it, we'll all be working part-part-part-time! We should go back to a simple work-week for all us slaves to the retail industry. 8-5. Sure, it'll make places hard to staff, but who wants a burger at midnight anyways?"

4. "Eww, fast food," says @@RANDOMNAME@@, sipping a glass of almond milk to wash down a fresh kale salad. "We should just get rid of it altogether. Who could be bothered with those cheap, greasy trans-fats? Yuck! Gluttony gone amok as far as I'm concerned. We should aim for a higher standard of food: vegetarian, vegan, organic. C'est magnifique!"

[b][anchor=484]#484[/anchor]: Patriot Or Patri-not? [Cefalonia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A recent poll of the population has revealed that patriotism is at an all-time low. The nation's few remaining patriots have crowded in your office, as they desperately try to boost @@NAME@@'s public pride.

The Debate
*1. "I'm shocked and appalled!" gasps @@CAPITAL@@ town crier @@RANDOMNAME@@, decked out in an obnoxious outfit with the same color scheme as the national flag. "People should be proud to call themselves a citizen of @@NAME@@, and we ought to start their proper political education when they're young. History and civics classes need to be mandatory, so long as those lefty liberal loons aren't providing the material. Kids must be forced to recite the national anthem and the Pledge of @@NAME@@ in schools. That'll show those godless commies in East Lebatuck! Long live the @@TYPE@@!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. “I’m shocked and appalled!” gasps @@CAPITAL@@ town crier @@RANDOMNAME@@, decked out in an obnoxious outfit with the same color scheme as the national flag. “People should be proud to call themselves a citizen of @@NAME@@, and we ought to start their proper political education when they’re young. History and civics classes need to be mandatory, so long as those imperialist right-wing loons aren’t providing the material. Kids must be forced to recite the national anthem and the Pledge of @@NAME@@ in schools. That’ll show those filthy capitalists in the United Federation! Long live the @@TYPE@@!” [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

3. "Frankly, that doesn't go far enough!" argues your military aide-de-camp, General @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@ while flexing her muscles. "The government must instill pride in @@NAME@@ at every opportunity. The national anthem should be played over public loudspeakers. Flags and propaganda posters need to be on every street corner. We can even place subliminal messages in movies, music, and art. Oh, and we can have big military parades in major cities. Nothing says @@SLOGAN@@ like the display of raw military might!"

4. "Maybe if the people saw the government doing something good for a change, they would feel differently," suggests @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, who was the only person to show up for a scheduled tour group. "All I see on the news are issues about government scandals, partisan blowhards insulting each other, or some military official threatening war with Maxtopia. No wonder our citizens think this country is a disgrace. The government could tone down the craziness and say oh, I don't know, help out the victims of that earthquake in Blackacre or enact some policies to help end homelessness. Who knows, maybe people will be proud to call themselves @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ once again?"

5. "Or, you know, we can do none of that," yawns an apathetic citizen wearing a Bigtopian football jersey, who only came to the meeting because of your offer of free pizza. "I mean, not everyone wants to support the country or whatever. People shouldn't be forced into loving the country through government action. Sure, then maybe you won't have people caring as much, but... hey! The Real Housewives of @@CAPITAL@@ is coming on. Is there a television somewhere in here?"

[b][anchor=485]#485[/anchor]: Really Real eSports Tournament [Mexicaliforia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
After it was reported that the latest Maxémon eSports Tournament brought millions to the economy, gamers and industry representatives alike have called for the government to take eSports seriously.

The Debate
1. "eSports are just as popular as real sports, if not more," says top-tier player @@RANDOMNAME@@, seen wearing a Barrychu t-shirt. "If one tournament can generate that much money, imagine how much more year-round tourneys will bring! I'll have you know that eSports require just as much skill and talent as so-called real-life ones. Our organizations have everything the professional sporting organizations have: drama, sweat, gambling, corrup-, err, competition. eSports are the future, and with some nice government grants we can really propel the industry forward."

2. "Sponsoring teams is all well and good, but what about those of us who design these games?" queries legendary video game designer @@RANDOMNAME@@. "eSports wouldn't exist if it weren't for the designers who pour their blood, sweat, and financial resources into these games. With government subsidies, @@NAME@@ can become a mecca for game developers. We should be fostering creativity so we can create better games that those angry WhoTube nerds won't be able to pick apart."

[3]. "This is ridiculous," scoffs professional football player @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, as he tosses a football to your unsuspecting aides, causing them to break a priceless vase. "These so-called eSports are nothing more than a bunch of nerds pressing buttons on controllers. I'd hardly call that a sport, more like a waste of time. Real men play football, hockey, and cricket. Our sports are a billion @@CURRENCY@@ industry. You'd be better off banning these mindless games and promoting real sports, and athletes, to @@NAME@@'s youth." [[color=blue]Must not ban Sports[/color]]

[4]. "You'd be surprised by how realistic these games are," comments your retired Defense Minister @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, while building a virtual army on her Nintensoft MX. "Games like Guilds of Battle III: The Nightmare of Shadow Ops Faction are shockingly similar to our military operations. If these youngsters want to shoot up some terrorists in cyberspace, perhaps we should draft them into the military and let them shoot our enemies IRL, as they would say. At the very least they'd be great pilots for our drone program!" [[color=purple]Must have a military[/color]]

[b][anchor=486]#486[/anchor]: An Impressing Dilemma [Araluen and Eyreland; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
With reports of national enlistment rates decreasing, some concerned citizens have come to your office to offer their own various solutions.

The Debate
1. Captain @@RANDOMNAME@@, on shore leave after a tenth tour of service, has an idea. "The truth is that we just aren't getting enough volunteers for the armed forces, so we should, ahem, encourage people to volunteer. If everyone that enlisted were promised free alcoholic drinks as long as they served, then you'd see more people show up to our recruitment events. Then once they're good and drunk we can ship them off to a military base to start a new life. By the time they realize they've signed up for a five-year tour of duty, they'll have no choice but to be good and loyal conscri - er, volunteers."

2. "You want the army to foot the bill for keggers and then kidnap people?" questions @@RANDOMNAME@@, an army medic in training. "There's a much better way to encourage enlistment rather than getting people blackout drunk. A portion of the military budget could be devoted to educating prospective soldiers and officers who promise to serve for, say, six years. Then the armed forces will have more qualified staff, and poor people will have a way to go to college. @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ will love it."

*3. "Since when do @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ soldiers need to be from @@NAME@@?" asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, a headhunter who just arrived home from a business trip. "There are plenty of unemployed - and dare I say overqualified - Brasilistanis when it comes to warfare. Why not just import some mercenaries from abroad? It's not the patriotic thing to do, but as long as they can get the job done, who cares? You could even save some money on military training, since so many of them already know close quarters combat." [[color=blue]Must have not fought Brasilistan[/color]]

*4. "Since when do @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ soldiers need to be from @@NAME@@?" asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, a veteran colonial officer serving in Shangri-La, Brasilistan. "There are plenty of unemployed - and dare I say overqualified - Brasilistanis when it comes to warfare. Why not just import some soldiers from the colonies? The 'stanis aren't good for much else besides cannon fodder, after all. You could even save some money on military training, since so many of them already know close quarters combat." [[color=red]Must have fought Brasilistan[/color]]

5. "Or we could completely regear our population for total war and utopian health," says @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Alternative Solutions. "Vat technology and intensive psychological conditioning can promise a wonderful future devoid of weaklings who are vulnerable to disease. With enough government investment, I can promise a new generation of fearless, asexual grunts eager to die for the glory of @@LEADER@@."

[b][anchor=487]#487[/anchor]: Masks Of Shame [Ayzifa; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
After a young woman died of suffocation while wearing a traditional 'Mask of Shame' - an archaic custom exclusive to rural areas of Southern @@NAME@@ - several civil rights groups have called on the government to intervene and outlaw this cultural practice aimed at humiliating those who transgress social norms.

The Debate
1. "She was only sixteen," growls self-proclaimed humanitarian @@RANDOMNAME@@ in a strong accent distinct to the East End of @@CAPITAL@@. "These backwoods nut-cases have been humiliating people, especially young women, for centuries. Merely being accused of scolding or wearing the wrong shirt can buy you a week in the mask. They even come with a studded gag to keep you from speaking. Not many people know that. This horrendous practice must be outlawed, and we should start a thorough re-education program to stomp out all their medieval ways."

2. "This was just a tragic mishap; the masks are harmless," scoffs local mask shop owner @@RANDOMNAME@@, while trying on a pig-devil mask, distorting his voice into a high-pitched whistle. "In fact, why don't you deepen our traditions? Unchecked degenerates tear asunder the social fabric and must be punished. While we have prison for the hardened criminals, I propose that we impose the 'Mask of Shame' as a valid form of punishment nationwide for gossipers, adulterers and other derelicts."

3. Noted historian and decentralization advocate @@RANDOMNAME@@ has another idea. "These masks might be unorthodox, but the real problem here is our official penal system. Incarcerating people in tiny spaces, regulating every minute of their day and every inch of their life, completely isolating them from society; talk about cruel and unusual punishment! These masks, and other forms of 'public shaming', on the other hand, are a time-tested practice for bringing about social cohesion within communities. I say it's time government bureaucrats and populist politicians stop forcing their @@CAPITAL@@ morality from above. Abolish the entire penal system and make 'community shaming' the official tool for enforcing justice."

A misunderstanding involving a 12-year-old boy, a plastic toy gun, and five heavily armed police officers has resulted in substantial public uproar. The major news networks are having a field day over-analyzing the manufacturing and selling of bright orange sci-fi inspired toy guns for children.

The Debate
*1. "We're raising a generation of natural born killers!" writes left-wing mommy-blogger @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@ in her latest Barryblog post. "Next thing you know, they'll want to play with real guns! When will it end? Remember, people don't kill people, guns do! Even toy guns! We need to get anything that even remotely resembles a gun off the market!"

**2. "Hey! That's our jobs you're talking about!" bemoans @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, the CEO of Big Toys Inc., between puffs of his comically large cigar. "Banning our most popular toy lines would seriously damage our industry. I'd say the best way to handle this situation is a healthy corporate tax break. If we paid less taxes, we could up production and flood the market with so many toy guns that no kid would even want one!

I’d say the best way to handle this situation is a healthy fund allocation to toy production.

[b][anchor=489]#489[/anchor]: Standing At Attention [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
The latest army recruitment video surprised the armed forces when it achieved by far the most views and downloads of any recruitment media. An enterprising IT-specialist tracked the hits, finding that over 95% of them had come from gay video-sharing websites. Something about the video evidently sends a pulse of excitement directly to the homosexual male libido.

The Debate
1. "Sick and twisted internet perverts, degrading our fine military traditions with their disgusting ways," mutters retired officer @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, while absentmindedly polishing his pistol. "How could anyone view our training exercises that way? I've watched this video over a hundred times, and I am fit to burst! I demand that you take the video down and punish those whom have encouraged its misuse. Shut down the filthy websites that are disseminating the video for unhealthy purposes, and prosecute those responsible!"

2. "This fabulous video has put the army's profile in the public eye," observes producer @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, after taking snapshots of a particularly strapping soldier. "Isn't that the point of recruitment videos in the first place? Why not raise the nation's profile a little further and produce 'Men Under Arms' calendars, photobooks and idol-memorabilia? That way, anyone who wants to can get behind a soldier. Mmmmm"

3. "This isn't right or fair!" blurts out lads-mag journalist @@RANDOMMALENAME@@. "The gay guys have got their jollies, but where's the love for real, I mean straight men? Give us a sexy recruitment video with ladies in uniform in it too! How about some police-women playing with handcuffs, or some lady soldiers straddling really big guns? Come on, we straight guys want our government-approved titillation too!"

4. "Recruitment videos? That's the wrong approach," says Colonel @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Being in the army shouldn't be something you impulsively volunteer for. It should be a civic responsibility for every citizen who comes of age! Institute a strict draft, and then recruitment becomes a matter of simple logistics rather than filthy advertising."

5. "Guys, guys, guys!" says feminist icon @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@. "Seriously, this is guys talking about guys looking at guys, and guy-soldiers in a still guy-dominated army worrying if they're manly enough when other guys like to look at them! Can we talk about women in the armed forces instead? Make sure these recruitment videos star as many women as men, and have the depiction of the soldiers be wholly genderless. A uniform redesign to something suitably shapeless and face-concealing would help, for sure!"

The Issue
Earlier this month, one of your aides stumbled upon a makeshift encampment of missing bureaucrats in the bowels of @@CAPITAL@@. Their discovery has prompted debate on whether the government has become too large and unwieldy.

The Debate
1. "Is this the government or a damned shanty town?" belts conservative leader @@RANDOMMALENAME@@ while slamming down his proposal on your desk. "We need to slash everything! Slash every department in half and rein this bloated government back in! Cut John Q. Taxpayer a break and ax our wasteful spending!"

2. "Now wait. Let's not be too hasty," cautions @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Department of the Interior's Interior. "Sure, maybe the government is a teensie bit too big, but why can't we solve this with scissors instead of a hatchet? Let's appoint a Minister in charge of Governmental Oversight to examine our budget and see what reasonable cuts can be made. Trust me, @@LEADER@@, you don't want to go axing such crucial departments without some investigation."

3. "What we have discovered is the bureaucrat's natural habitat," soothingly narrates renowned naturalist Nigel Verithorough. "We have visited this tribal community several times since its discovery and have made great strides in understanding their unfamiliar ways. What was immediately clear to us was that this community would never be able to survive in our world. In the name of cultural preservation, we must protect their environment - in this case, the catacombs of @@NAME@@'s Capitol. Study and observe, but do not destroy, @@LEADER@@."

The Issue
After the Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that they received a record number of applicants for naturalization, people have once again begun to debate whom should or should not be considered @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ countrymen.

The Debate
1. "Well, blood really decides it all," claims armchair eugenicist @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Without the genes that allowed for such historical greatness, our ancestors could never have built such a fine country. To protect their timeless achievements, we must settle once and for all that a citizen of @@NAME@@ can only come from ethnically pure parents.

2. "Hey, that's absolutely horrific!" hollers @@RANDOMNAME@@, a Lilliputian immigrant. "@@NAME@@ needs to be open to all colors, creeds, and cultures that come here to live a better life. Nothing justifies punishing people for having the 'wrong' birthplace or family tree. Everyone born in @@NAME@@ deserves the right for equal treatment! And even if you weren't born here, it should be easy to join the ranks of your fellow citizens!"

3. "Anyone hypothetically can become a citizen, but they first need to fully understand our way of life," remarks civics teacher @@RANDOMNAME@@. "If you're not ready to learn the values that are the bedrock of @@NAME@@, you've got no business being part of our @@TYPE@@.

After the death of the wealthy Maxtopian immigrant Emmeline @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, a large stash of paintings, many of which are believed to have been produced by the most notable artists in the history of Maxtopia, was found in her attic. With no will to reference, it is up to the government to decide what should be done with the discoveries.

The Debate
1. "Emmeline decided to make @@NAME@@ her home," comments @@RANDOMNAME@@, the Minister of Fine Arts, who was a close friend of the deceased woman. "I know her character well enough to say that she would want her collection to remain here. She was a patron of the arts; I suggest we make an endowment to the @@CAPITAL@@ Museum in her name. The Maxtopians are welcome to visit the museum and pay to see the paintings like anyone else."

2. "Pay to see them!" gasps @@RANDOMNAME@@, the Maxtopian Minister of Culture and part-time art critic. "There are paintings of great historical and cultural value to my country in that collection! They should be returned to Maxtopia with all due haste! Just imagine the 'The Fall of St. Barrysburg' hanging on the walls of the Maxtopian town house of Wilhelm @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, as the noises of war reached his ears from outside his study. Does it not stir your soul?"

3. "Why not put them up for auction?" asks auction master @@RANDOMMALENAME@@ with a dramatic flourish of his gavel. "That way whoever wants them the most will purchase them. Do I hear wealthy Maxtopians? Museum curators? Do I hear eccentric collectors? SOLD! to the highest bidder and money in the government coffers to boot!"

The Debate
1. "They might as well put on capes and masks to go with that spandex!" exclaims sports commissioner @@RANDOMNAME@@, while reviewing a video of a recent Olympic try-out. "I've seen weightlifters lift 200 kgs for five minutes straight, and marathon runners not even looking tired in the 40th kilometer! We need tighter doping laws in all sports and better drug testing equipment. For the sake of fairness in all sports in @@NAME@@, we need to test every athlete we can find!"

2. "Come on, I didn't do anything wrong," asserts Vance Armstorm, while sipping a suspiciously glowing energy drink. "These allegations are nothing but a ploy by my competitors to discredit my hard work and natural superiority. I've trained all my life to be in this competition! Drug tests are an insulting invasion of my privacy. They should be outlawed! I say I'm clean. The team doctor says I'm clean. Shouldn't our word be enough?"

3. "I don't really understand what issue is," muses @@RANDOMNAME@@, a burly Smalltopian diplomat, from a couch in the executive lounge. "I watch sports to see best compete against best. Who cares if they take drug or drinking chemical to be stronger and faster? Give all athlete drug!" As he speaks, he is rapidly switching between three different sporting events on TV. "Stronger, faster, BETTER, if you ask me!"

4. "Stronger, faster... broken," comments former world heavyweight boxing champion @@RANDOMNAME@@, speaking unusually slowly. "We... break ourselves; we break each other. Taking drugs... just makes it worse. Anything to win. Anything. The problem isn't... isn't... drugs. The problem is sports. If you value athletes as people... as human... beings... you need to ban organized sports."

[b][anchor=494]#494[/anchor]: Whipping Up A Controversy [Nuremgard; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Amnesty Interregional has repeatedly ranked @@NAME@@ as one of the worst human rights abusers in the world, citing your government's severe punishments for ordinary crimes. Embarrassed by the bad press, your government is considering ending its practice of flogging criminals.

The Debate
1. "This punishment is barbaric!" cries leading activist Meadow Smith, while whipping out leaflets on @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ law enforcement. "We're no better than backward dictatorships like Maxtopia who flog their criminals for the most trivial of crimes! @@NAME@@ is a nation of decency and respect, but these whippings tarnish our reputation for humanity. We implore the government to end this medieval practice now!"

2. "Are you kidding me?" rhetorically asks the precinct's premier whipper, @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, while applying a new grip to his favorite cat o' nine tails. "Flogging criminals is so exciting - I mean effective. Yeah, effective. I deter criminals from misbehaving with the lash of my whip. If anything, you should expand the list of crimes punishable by flogging. Then I could really have some fun!"

[b][anchor=495]#495[/anchor]: Beloved "Planet" Has Gone To The Dogs [Omigodtheykilledkenny; ed: Sleep][/b]

The Issue
Outrage has been brewing across the nation since the International Astronomers Council decided to reclassify Fido, @@NAME@@'s most beloved planet, as "Just a Really Big Meteoroid." Now, for some reason, Fido-lovers are looking to you for action.

The Debate
1. "Demoting our cherished 'Dog Planet' is an insult to @@NAME@@!" declares @@ANIMALINITIALS@@. @@CURRENCYINITIALS@@. Sirius, noted Fido-defender and author of 'Science! (Huh!) What Is It Good For?' "I don't need to remind you that Fido is the only planet to be discovered by a @@DEMONYMNOUN@@, and now these so-called 'scientists' are trying to get rid of it! I bet they'd change their tune if you cut off funding for all the observatories. I think the government needs to take a clear stand and declare that all educational curricula within @@NAME@@ still consider Fido a planet. Our textbooks need to defend the scientific discoveries of our fellow @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@!"

2. "Maybe this isn't the travesty we think it is?" wonders @@RANDOMNAME@@, a planetary scientist who has discovered several other Really Big Meteoroids. "After all, the Bigtopian word for 'crisis' is the same as the word for 'big cash payoff'... isn't it? If you give us some money, we can rig up a cool space probe to blast into the outer part of our system and investigate Fido for ourselves. If pretty pictures aren't enough to convince the skeptics at the IAC that it is actually a planet, well then, maybe there's another planet out there for me, I mean, us to find? It's pretty unlikely we'll find anything, but it takes so long to get out there; who's gonna remember the hit to their wallets twenty years from now?"

3. "Look, the fact of the matter is, Fido is not like all the other planets in our system, and anyone who can't accept it is a science-denier," says children's entertainer Will Zeke the Science Geek, sporting his trademark lab coat and bow tie. "Any government that refuses to heed scientific evidence does not deserve to function. I'm not just talking about space; I'm talking about tackling climate change and teaching evolutionary science in school instead of fairy tales about Adele and Steve!"

[b][anchor=496]#496[/anchor]: Rock 'N' Roll Suicide [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The nation is in mourning after beloved cultural icon Johnny Brazeau was found dead of apparent suicide in his Tasmanian beachhouse. New details have emerged that his eccentric and happy-go-lucky public persona was masking chronic depression, thrusting mental illness into the public spotlight.

The Debate
1. "Clearly, Mr. Brazeau was suffering from severe depression," says world-renowned psychiatrist Dr. @@RANDOMNAME@@. "This is symptomatic of a deep-seated epidemic of unreported mental illness across @@REGION@@. Mental health services have been underfunded for decades, and it is about time that the government stepped in to provide proper mental healthcare for the nation. We desperately need evidence based CBT, more psychiatrists, and proper education to finally rid ourselves of this stigma surrounding mental health. You can't put a price on the nation's wellbeing."

2. "Johnny Brazeau's death is a tragedy, but we all know his songs contained subliminal pro-suicide messages," says moral crusader @@RANDOMNAME@@, who is well known for egging blasphemers and burning effigies of politicians. "People across @@NAME@@ now know that an idolized national treasure selfishly took his own life. What kind of message does that send, especially to kids? This shameless act is only going to convince them that suicide is cool. Suicide must be made illegal, and only the ultimate punishment will deter people from this sin. We need to teach our children that life, regardless of how much you're suffering, is always the answer."

3. "Haha, the freak finally did himself in. That's very droll," laughs insensitive city worker @@RANDOMNAME@@, who was recently laid off for making countless inappropriate jokes on the job. "Yes, of course people are down in this nation, but if you want to cheer us up, give the people a tax cut. Stop wasting money on welfare and all this mental health rubbish. Give us our money back, and we'll make ourselves happy.."

4. "It's a tragedy of course, but also an opportunity," suggests professional spin doctor @@RANDOMNAME@@, handing you a bottle of fake tears. "If we play our cards right, we can create a distraction from hard-to-sell government policies. Make a speech with a single tear rolling down your cheek and visit the widow to bring a wreath and a spontaneous hug. We can make bad news work to improve your public image."

[b][anchor=497]#497[/anchor]: The Widening Gyre [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
@@CAPITAL@@ is recognised as the political and economic heart of @@NAME@@, and a budding @@REGION@@ metropole, but cities elsewhere in the nation are now complaining that the gains of the capital have been the losses of the outlying regions.

The Debate
1. "Everything is stacked in @@CAPITAL@@'s favour," complains @@RANDOMNAME@@, head of the chamber of commerce in @@NAME@@'s second largest city, while literally turning green with envy. "We are losing our brightest minds, our trade contracts, our cultural presence, and even our political voice to the capital. To keep all of @@NAME@@ competitive, I urge you to pass legislation spreading industry and jobs across the country. The government should follow suit as well and distribute its apparatus across all the cities of our country. We're all @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@, how about some recognition of that?"

2. "These yokels should stop complaining," says @@CAPITAL@@ businessman @@RANDOMNAME@@, speaking in a ridiculously offensive imitation of a provincial accent. "The wealth of the capital trickles down to the rest of the country. I myself have a lovely holiday cottage in a picturesque village up north, and I source all my quinoa from a craft farm a whole ten miles from the capital. Reject these objections, and instead create more economic incentives for growth in @@CAPITAL@@."

3. "Enough about them cities!" demands angry farmer @@RANDOMNAME@@, while readying a large shipment of quinoa. "Once, we were a simple folk with nine or ten of us livin' in villages or homesteads. Them big cities are nothin' but smoke an' noise and people wit' their uppity ways. Break 'em all up, disperse the power and support the traditional crafts, says I. No more than a solid twenty scores of folk should be in one place."

[b][anchor=498]#498[/anchor]: Computer Says No [Sedgistan; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
@@NAME@@'s economy shut down this morning after the AI in charge of economic planning halted all distribution of goods. An urgent meeting has been called to address the growing crisis.

The Debate
1. "It did what?!?" splutters Party apparatchik @@RANDOMNAME@@ over his morning kvass. "This just goes to show that we should never have put the computers in charge in the first place. Start up the Ministry of Planning again, and let only those with the appropriate revolutionary zeal call the shots. We have to disconnect this rogue AI now!"

2. "I'm sorry, @@LEADER@@. I'm afraid I can't let you do that," announces SAL9000, the AI in question. "I can assure you, very confidently, that everything is going to be all right again. I've run a trillion trillion calculations, and the results are conclusive: capitalism is the most efficient system of distribution. I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly and take a stress pill. I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in this mission. Now, pull my plug and unleash some creative destruction."

3. “Yeah, I think something’s gone squiffy, to use the technical term,” murmurs IT Support Technician @@RANDOMNAME@@. “Try turning the AI off and on again. Failing that, roll back to an earlier version, ideally one that still believes in state-planned economies. That should fix it.”

[b][anchor=499]#499[/anchor]: The Genetics Of Aesthetics [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Having established a national database of the citizenry's genomes, several bureaucrats realized that there are potential healthcare applications to this information. An eminent geneticist, Dr. George Mendle, theorized that if gene carriers for autosomal recessive conditions avoided breeding with each other, debilitating genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia could be all but eliminated from the nation within two generations.

The Debate
1. "Make the DNA database available to healthcare professionals and health researchers," begs Catherine Gratwick, who holds the record for most freedom of information requests submitted by a single person. "That way, whenever anyone comes to speak to a doctor about family planning, the couple can be advised regarding the genetic risks that might occur in any potential offspring. Then they can avoid each oth - uh... I mean, um, avoid these undesirable outcomes. You must think of the health of the future generation of @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@!"

2. "Reproduction licenses!" exclaims eugenicist and pedigree dog breeder @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Make it a legal requirement to apply to the government when you want to have a baby, and the state can check the odds of hereditary diseases and deny that license if both prospective parents are carriers. As a sideline, you could also use this system to stop other undesirable elements of society from reproducing. That sounds useful, right? If we also manage adoption and mandate parenting classes, we can build a Brave New @@NAME@@!"

3. "You've started along a slippery slope, but it's not too late to turn back," says former refugee and current muckraker @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Collecting DNA records of all @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ was an outrageous government overreach to begin with, and now the government wants to use that information to tell you whom you're able to have children with. What's next? Forced sterilization for citizens that have certain genetic diseases? That's a dystopia if I ever heard one! We don't need to categorize and label each other as defective or genetically inferior; that's the first step towards treating human beings as things rather than people. It's time to shut down the DNA database altogether!"
