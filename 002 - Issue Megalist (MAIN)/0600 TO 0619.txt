[b][anchor=600]#600[/anchor]: Making A House A Home [The Grim Reaper; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue 
After the street outside your personal residence proved incapable of handling a diplomatic motorcade and @@NAME@@'s biggest house party at the same time, your Foreign Minister has suggested that the state procure and maintain an official residence for you to live in.

The Debate
1. "It is absolutely essential that you have a home away from home," insists your Foreign Minister, pointing excitedly at an interior design magazine from before you were born. "Imagine if the ambassador had been run over by that party bus! An official residence would keep you and your honoured guests safe from the hooligans, the thugs, and the public. In fact, we can turn the residence into a Museum of @@NAME@@'s History, with a veritable cornucopia of cultural artifacts on display. It would be a perfect reconstruction of our glory days and as an added bonus, the police can keep the kids off your lawn."

*[2]. "You're not just a memory - you're our future," chimes in t-shirt aficionado and social media CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "@@NAME@@ doesn't need to be reminded of its past! This won't just be a home - this will be a technological revolution! It'll house its own webservers, a television-quality livestreaming studio, and a digital personality, all powered by ethically sourced solar panels. The youth and the technophiles will adore you, from a safe distance." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color] AND [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

*[3]. "You're not just a memory - you're our future," chimes in t-shirt aficionado and head of State Social Media @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "@@NAME@@ doesn't need to be reminded of its past! This won't just be a home - this will be a technological revolution! It'll house its own webservers, a television-quality livestreaming studio, and a digital personality, all powered by ethically sourced solar panels. The youth and the technophiles will adore you, from a safe distance." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color] AND [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

4. "Oh, please. I'm all for keeping government out of the bedroom, and that counts doubly for yours," snarls libertarian and small-government proponent, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who gets worked up if the government so much as fixes a pothole. "You can drive, or take a cab, or hire a personal bus at your own cost. A house shouldn't be any different. Since when should the taxpayers be asked to foot the bill when half of us don't even like you? If you want to be taken seriously, go and rent an apartment in @@CAPITAL@@ with a couple of roommates. Leave us taxpayers out of it, okay?"

5. "I'm with the anarchist, I want no part in building your ivory tower!" declares decentralization activist, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, founder of several, competing local governance associations. "What you need is to really get out there and see all that @@NAME@@ has to offer. You need an official, open, and accessible residence. Why not get yourself a mobile home and tour it around the country, town by town, like a rock star? You aren't too good to talk to us commoners, you know - if anything, it's the other way around!" He spits on your desk and turns his back on you.

6. "Don't listen to that traitorous anarchist!" pipes up your lazy, entitled niece who just woke up from a nap on your couch. "Of course you need a personal residence, for you and your family! Imagine a grand castle, complete with servants, a hedge maze, and massive golden statues of yourself! Your home would be the envy of leaders across @@REGION@@, and anybody who complains can be thrown in the dungeons for our amusement. Just bulldoze a forest somewhere and start construction NOW!"

[7]. "Come on, the ambassadors love my mojitos!" drawls your neighbour, and now-legendary party host, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What if, like, your current digs were just a bit more open? You wouldn't need an official residence. We'd just use your place! My home is your home, and I'm sure all the fun people of @@NAME@@ would love to party with those foreign dignitaries of yours. Besides, I'm sure a few drunken ambassadors would spill out our enemies' secrets, am I right?" [[color=blue]Alcohol is legal[/color]]

[b][anchor=601]#601[/anchor]: Lawyers On Trial [Tzarsgrad; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
Notorious gangster Johnny 'Stab-Stab' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ was recently found 'not guilty' on multiple charges leveled against him, despite a broad expectation from citizens and the media that he would be convicted. Experts are saying that the surprising result was the consequence of Johnny hiring the very best private defence lawyers, while the prosecution was led by an inexperienced and overworked public prosecutor who was so tired he could barely keep his eyes open through the case.

The Debate
1. "Zzzzzz... Huh? What? Wasafargit blarg?" garbles public prosecutor Ivan Anap, as you nudge him into wakefulness. "Uh... Look, I've done a bad job, clearly. But have you seen my case load? I gotta represent the downtrodden masses and the... wossname... penniless crowds. The system deserves more money, so we can get better public servants, and so I can get some... some... slee..." He collapses, face-first onto the floor.

2. "Don't mind Rip Van Winkle here," growls 'Filthy' Harold Callahan, a cop with little love for lawyers, kicking the sleeping attorney in the gut. "All these 'public servants' are doing is clogging up the system, and keeping justice from being served. I say scrap the system entirely and keep honest taxpayers from paying for the bureaucracy of criminality. Let people hire their fancy-schmancy punk lawyers if they want to, but don't make ME pay for those bottom-feeding scum. Let's have less talk and more justice."

3. "That's ridiculous, obviously," says government minister Justitia Caecus, as she searches for a pair of dropped contact lenses. "Public defenders and prosecutors are obviously something we can't afford to lose. But why not go further? Why not have every individual be assigned state representation only, regardless of financial standing? That would go a long way toward promoting true justice within our nation. Sure, the lawyers might complain that you'll be making them public servants on a public service wage, but don't we care about fairness and justice?" 

4. "But still, it won't be truly fair, will it?" muses futurist Diana Moon. "Even randomly allocated lawyers will vary in ability. I've been reading about something called Vonnegut-handicapping: using external devices to create equality of ability. Allow both private and state-funded lawyers, but fit them with a shock collar that gives them distracting electrical shocks throughout a court case. The greater their recorded success rate, the more often they will receive shocks. That way, everyone will eventually receive the same level of expertise in their legal counsel. Flawless logic, correct?"

[b][anchor=602]#602[/anchor]: Hobby Lobby [Drasnia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
A recent poll has suggested that many ordinary people don't consider national leader @@LEADER@@ to be very 'relatable'. Your advisers are perplexed as to the reasons why, and have suggested that taking up a hobby might boost your ratings, as well as tell the people what sort of person you are.

The Debate
[1]. "Everybody in @@REGION@@ loves basketball," exaggerates famed athlete @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dribbling on your carpet. "Catch! Pass it here! Look at that: Nothing but net." [[color=blue]Sports are legal[/color]]

2. Dance instructor @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ waltzes into your office. He takes your hand and begins a foxtrot. "Isn't this invigorating? Come, let me teach you to pirouette around delicate situations you may encounter."

3. "Crikey!" nature documentarian @@RANDOM_NAME@@ exclaims, creeping into your office. "What we've got 'ere is a politician in its natural 'abitat. If only it would get outside and let its wild side out, it wouldn't have near so many national crises to deal with."

[4]. Your niece suddenly squeals. "Look at this adorable puppy! I need to share it with my friends! Do you have a Farcebook account? It would really help connect with people and let me send you this GIF." [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

5. Your nephew appears and rolls a set of dice on your desk. "According to my manual of Castles & Kobolds, I just rolled a 20 on my Charisma-check for you to game with me. Come on, we need a healer: got a fizzy Eckie-Cola here with your name on it."

6. Flat-cap wearing Heritage Locomotive Enthusiast @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ snorts in laughter at the geekiness on display. "You'll be wantin' a proper hobby: model engines, to show yer love of craftsmanship, and of steel, steam and smoke."

7 . "Just tell them your hobbies are reading, and walking, and socialising," suggests CV-writer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "That way nobody can judge you or form conclusions about you."

[b][anchor=603]#603[/anchor]: Not My Idea [Faehig; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
In the throes of an exceptionally lethargic news cycle, the media is turning its attention on the unusual absence of copyright law in @@NAME@@. At the centre of this debate is the author of an obscure book series, who is demanding artistic justice after an online fan fiction based on his work eclipsed its inspiration in popularity.

The Debate
*1. "This is just... [i]uurrggghh![/i]" slurs @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, author of [i]The Demon-Wizards of D'haw'e'na'wor[/i], holding an empty bottle of scotch. "I work, nnhh, slave my whole life, put my soul into this... Only to be overshadowed by some, some half-brained teenager who... who... stole my ideas! We need copyright laws back to protect... uh... the dignity of authors!" Finishing his rant, he vomits into a nearby bucket. [[color=blue]Must not ban alcohol[/color]]

*2. "This is just... [i]uurrggghh![/i]" slurs @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, author of [i]The Demon-Wizards of D'haw'e'na'wor[/i], holding an empty bottle of illegal scotch. "I work, nnhh, slave my whole life, put my soul into this... Only to be overshadowed by some, some half-brained teenager who... who... stole my ideas! We need copyright laws back to protect... uh... the dignity of authors!" Finishing his rant, he vomits into a nearby bucket. [[color=red]Must ban alcohol[/color]]

3. "I don't see what the big problem is, tbh," remarks TwiliteSlaya123 in an author's note in the latest chapter of [i]Fifty Shades of The Demon-Wizards[/i]. "It's just like, I wrote this, kay? Lay off plz! Imo, the government should be supporting us artists! Like by giving me money for being awesome. Next story haz Gay Gandledore setting a dozen Angel-Dragon-Goblins ablaze. 4 teh lulz."

*4. "There is a solution to this issue that is absolutely fair, though its a teensy bit complicated," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former copyright lawyer begging for change on the street corner. "You can let people write freely, but at the same time allow for civil court claims for portions of profit, based on the contribution to the creative process the original ideas-makers have. So, if you've got a Demon-Wizard in there, then the author can claim a few percent; if you've got an orc in there, then the George JK Token estate can have a chunk; if you've got a style reminiscent of another author a few percentage to them; and so on. Sure, that'll require a lot of court time and complex legal arguments, but... but... I NEED A JOB! I'm begging you, please!" As the closing statement of @@HIS@@ argument, @@HE@@ collapses sobbing, hugging your leg. [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*5. "There is a solution to this issue that is absolutely fair, and free of complications," says Otohime Leach, a former frustrated author turned Communist Party bureaucrat. "You can let people write freely, but make it clear that the idea of ownership of creative works is capitalist decadence, and that the state holds all copyrights and indeed, all written works of any sort. That way, we get to be the arbiters of what may and may not be published." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

[b][anchor=604]#604[/anchor]: Food Behind Bars [Barunia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue 
After renowned food critic and criminal mastermind Hannibal Terwilliger published a book entitled [i]Food Behind Bars: A Gourmet's Journey through @@NAME@@'s Prisons[/i], a debate has sprung up over the quality of food served to prisoners.

The Debate
1. "This is ridiculous!" fumes single mother of three @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, whose ex-husband is currently behind bars. "Here's me struggling just to give my kids the basics, and he's sitting in a nice warm cell with nothing to do all day but eat like a king! I say we stop this extravagance and redirect the funding into something more appropriate, like welfare for single parents. Prisoners should only be fed what they need to survive."

2. "Oh come now, there's no need to treat us like animals for the sake of a few misdemeanours," says Mr. Terwilliger via a satellite link from an undisclosed minimum security prison. "We prisoners have rights too, you know. Oh what a cruel world we would live in, if a man can't chow down on cordon bleu just because he's behind bars. Now warden, can I have some fava beans and a nice chianti delivered to my cell? I'm starving."

3. "Of course you have to feed prisoners, but what kind of food?" muses oblivious naturalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while watering your plastic office plants. "It's all these preservatives and cheap imported foods that have made these people violent in the first place! Why not establish prison farms and have inmates eat what they grow? Sure, it would tie up lots of fertile land, and there's always the risk of an escape, but the benefits to society are worth it."

*4. "Well, look here, you've got all these mouths to feed, and you don't want the expense?" queries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Fried @@ANIMAL@@, one of @@NAME@@'s most popular fast food chains. "Looks like this here's something the private sector can help you with, and by private sector I mean my company! Just grant us the exclusive right to provide catering in all of @@NAME@@'s prisons, and we'll keep all those prisoners stuffed for a fraction of the cost! The government saves, the prisoners eat, and I cut out the compet-, er, provide a vital service to the community. It's a win-win!" [[color=blue]Must have private enterprise[/color] AND/OR? [color=blue]Must not be vegetarian[/color]]

*5. "If you've got many mouths to feed, and not enough food, then the solution is simple," says Internment Facilitator Earl Herrelko, from the Chief Directorate of Camps. "Just reduce the number of mouths! Have your prison facilities in regions with sub-zero temperatures, leave the heating off, and by winter's end the problems will have self-resolved." [[color=red]Must not have private enterprise[/color]]

[b][anchor=605]#605[/anchor]: The Noblest Of Intentions [The Grim Reaper; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue 
Outraged serfs are striking in the streets today, after the newly appointed Duke of @@CAPITAL@@ flippantly subinfeudated the capital's West End to a wealthy foreign investor, bestowing upon him peons, mesne lordship rights and a lesser noble title.

The Debate
1. "Bringing back the oppression of serfdom was bad enough, but now you're giving away our homes, us, even, to a foreigner?" shouts a mud-stained @@RANDOM_NAME@@, proud WestEnder and this week's executive officer of a local anarcho-syndicalist commune. "The only thing that outlander ever did for @@NAME@@ was invest in that so-called Duke's business! There's nothing noble about perpetuating the economic and social differences in our society. Down with feudalism! Give us back @@NAME@@ the way we like it. Boo!!!"

2. "Frankly, you should be thanking me for helping @@NAME@@ recruit business leaders from all over the world," drawls the Duke of @@CAPITAL@@, laughing maniacally as he thumbs through one of his many passports. "Remember why we did this in the first place: to ensure an obedient and productive workforce that will help us win a place as a powerhouse in the international economy. Let us quell the commoners and teach them their proper place! Anyway, my old Maxtopian mate from boarding school is looking to get into cotton - are you terribly attached to @@ANIMAL@@ Park?"

3. "We need to return to the good old days, when a noble title was recognition of good blood," contends @@RANDOM_NAME@@, draped in the flag and failing miserably to rip a foreign banknote in half. "Our nobility shouldn't bring dirty foreigners into the centre of our economy; the only people allowed to own businesses and serfs should be @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ through and through - people like you and me."

[b][anchor=606]#606[/anchor]: In The Black [Gharoukannia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
Determined to make their point strongly, an intimidating gang of Customs Police Officers and Revenue officials have arrived at your front door with sacks full of junk: home-copied DVDs, knock-off imitation designer clothes and dodgy electronics gear. All these are illegally traded goods, seized today within a mile's distance of your own home. The black market is out of control, they say, circumventing both industrial standards and retail taxation. 

The Debate
1. "We must break illegal trade with the direct application of brute force!" roars Revenue Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, incandescent with rage. "Send in the police force! Send in SWAT teams! Destroy these outlaws and punish their customers! Undeclared trade is tax evasion, and tax evasion is [i]rebellion[/i]. Crush the rebels!"

2. A cockney fellow in a long trench coat sidles up to you and whips it open in front of you. To your relief, the only thing he is exposing is a selection of fake watches hanging from the inner lining. "Cor blimey, guv'nor, the black market is just us geezers exercising a bit of cheeky chappy freedom! Duzzit do yer harm? No it don't! Duzzit make people chipper? Yes it does! Just have the old rozzers leave us in peace, and turn a blind eye or two to stuff falling off a lorry, and we'll all be laffin' our way to the bank. Now, would you like two Rowlex timepieces for the price of one?"

3. "He has a point... The black market's size is indicative of a free economy's response to government over-regulation," observes @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a far-more respectable looking businessman, presenting you with some colourful line-graphs to support his argument. "Relax those regulations, and economies of scale will allow legitimate private industry to triumph, and the proportion of economic activity dominated by the black market will likely fall. The black market is just a symptom. Wage laws, bureaucratic red tape, excessive industrial standards: they're the real sickness."

[b][anchor=607]#607[/anchor]: If Your Election Lasts Longer Than Four Weeks... [Nation of Quebec; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue 
The next election is drawing near, and over drinks you flippantly mentioned to a few Party loyalists the idea of extending the political season to a whopping sixty-nine days. Upon hearing the plan, your campaign manager immediately passed out from an overwhelming panic attack, fearing the agony of such a long campaign.

The Debate
1. "I'm not sure what you hope to gain with this," gasps @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your trusted campaign manager, while holding a cold flannel to his forehead. "The Party's funds can only be stretched so thin, and it's only a matter of time before one of our candidates does something outrageously stupid that sabotages our reputation. What we need to do is make sure the election dates are fixed, with a fixed length and fixed results... I mean, fixed rules on campaign spending! Once the people see how open and transparent we are, we'll all be re-elected in a landslide."

2. "The longer, the better!" enthuses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your top donors, who is rumored to have made a killing off the Wezeltonian War. "Prolonged election campaigns will bleed the Opposition dry of their campaign funds, while giving us more time to ask for donations and publicize the competition's scandals. I'm sure some voters will get sick of the incessant ads, but their irritation is my golden opportunity!"

3. "No! No! I can't take another election circus!" panics @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a refugee from the United Federation. "Where I come from, election season lasts a painful twenty-four months, and the endless mudslinging during debates and advertisements between TV shows are slowly driving everyone insane. Insane I tell you! Please, for the sake of common decency, ban all political campaigns. We're better off not being constantly bothered by political hacks, anyways."

[b][anchor=608]#608[/anchor]: Thrown Into Sharp Relief [Dman4835; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A 3-year-old girl, named @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@, recently died from a nasty chest infection. The case was notable, as doctors are claiming that a simple course of penicillin could easily have saved her life, and are laying blame for the death upon the advice of a 'spirit-energy healer' who advised the girl's parents to treat their child with acupuncture.

The Debate
1. "Allowing these fraudsters to kill children with their pseudo-medical claptrap should be criminal!" shouts Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a famed debunker of alternative medicine, as @@HE@@ slaps a hot mug of soothing echinacea tea out of your hands. "The same standards of evidence-based practice and criminal responsibility that doctors face should be forced on these conmen. Also, any parents who deny their children proper medical treatment should be held accountable for criminal neglect."

2. "What happened to that child was a tragedy," concedes animistic healer @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ as she hangs amethyst pendants around the room to absorb the negative energies being generated, "but my prescribed treatments would have saved his life, if only they hadn't been disrupted by the scepticism and disbelief from his biomedical doctors. I can show you the logical arguments that underpin my science, but ultimately, shouldn't everyone have the freedom to choose their own health care provider?"

3. "Look, I love freedom as much as the next passer-by who needs to crash at your place," comments @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@, a random hobo rousing from a nap on your couch to voice an opinion, "but to me it sounds like this is about the state's responsibility for the safety of children. Why not just force parents to take their kids to an actual doctor, but let the adults do whatever they want with their own bodies? Also, are you going to finish that sandwich?"

The Issue
A group of surprisingly hip and mellow businessmen have meandered over to your office, with paperwork to propose [i]@@ANIMAL@@fest[/i], a celebration of music, dance and good times that will incidentally make them a truckload of money. They see your nation not only as the new stomping grounds for this annual music festival, but also as a place that could be seen as being friendly to festival culture in general, welcoming the dread-locked (and sometimes nude) bear-dancing nomads, with their mind-altering substances, groovy music and economy-stimulating disposable incomes.

The Debate
1. "This festeroo is gonna be groovy, man!" croons @@RANDOM_NAME@@, famous lead guitarist of Grateful Floyd. "I can't wait to transcend the minds of all that watch me, man! My guitar just may steal your face right off your head, stick it on a rock-rocket and then set the controls for the heart of the sun! Ya know, man?! @@LEADER@@, you can even jam with us if you give us the space for this festival!"

2. "I don't know about this!" worries @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, an angry old man. "These darn hippies want to be flooding my town with their drug paraphernalia, their smelly bodies, their electronical guitars and their 'popping' music! Keep these drug-fuelled, fried-egg-brained layabouts out of our great nation! Say no to drugs! Say no to subversive drug music! Say no to young people!"

3. "How about we have the festival, but supply enough police presence to keep the drugs out?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former weed-smoking spiritualist turned substance-abuse counsellor. "We can have our police force monitor the festival, and maybe also have an anti-drug awareness campaign working the festival, and some consultation work to minimise local disruption and environmental impact. We can have a good time and keep the drugs away... It's all about the music, isn't it?"

[b][anchor=610]#610[/anchor]: Only @@LEADER@@ Could Go To Dàguó [Drasnia; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
The Holy Emperor of the militaristic and isolationist nation Dàguó has invited you to his palace for a state dinner in an attempt to warm decades of frosty relations.

The Debate
1. "IT'S A TRAP!" shouts Admiral @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ de Calamari, a military attaché who seems borderline paranoid. "Isn't it obvious? They're only inviting you over there so they can KILL you! They'll either poison you or stab you in your sleep. Trust me, you can't trust these Dàguó animals. They will kill you the moment you let your guard down."

2. "I agree that we shouldn't go over there," replies @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your personal chef, who is always dying to experiment with new cuisine. "However, that doesn't mean we should ourselves embark on a policy of isolationism. Why not invite this Emperor of theirs over here and treat him to a state dinner? There's much to discuss like their Tasmanian trade sanctions or the steady stream of refugees from the Maxtopian Civil War."

3. "Dàguó's leaders have historically denounced our great nation for covert operations that, err, officially, we still deny," mentions Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@ between introductory college lectures. "Meeting with Dàguó's Holy Emperor would be a perfect way to begin to mend relations. Accept the invitation, respect their customs regardless of how strange they might seem, and act like a real national leader for once! Go out there and start advocating for world peace, and history will thank you."

[4]. After repeatedly hitting on your secretary, a somewhat suave secret agent introduces himself as, "Bont ... James Bont. Go over to Dàguó on the pretext of a diplomatic mission. Meanwhile, I will pose as a Marche Noirian master chef so I can poison the Emperor's meal. Once he drops dead, his security is going to suspect foul play, but I'll be there to extract you back to @@CAPITAL@@ via rocketcar.

[b][anchor=611]#611[/anchor]: Blundering Battle Bureaucrats [Free Syllvin; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
After stepping off the path in @@CAPITAL@@ Park to take a picture of @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@, a Bigtopian tourist was subject to @@NAME@@ Defense Regulations Volume 4, Bylaw 8-A, Chapter 23, Section G-17-5, Paragraph 4b and was subsequently obliterated by a full battalion of @@NAME@@'s finest.

The Debate
1. "That's just how our glorious nation operates!" says @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the Sub-Minister of Internal Affairs of the Defense of the Internal Affairs of the National Sub-Committee of Sovereign Urban Parks. "We didn't get where we are today by letting those dirty, out-of-line foreigners trample our carefully manicured petunia bushes!" She tries to wave a copy of the @@NAME@@ Defense Regulations Volume 4 at you for emphasis, the sheer bulk of the tome forces her to resort to instead slamming the book onto your desk. The legs creak under the weight. "We need more safeguards against external aggression: no entry signs in multiple languages, tracking anklets issued at the border, oodles of barbed wire, and high-yield minefields! Summer tourists and all other miscreants like them are a threat to society, and if we need to have a show of force to keep them in line, by the @@TYPE@@ we should do so!"

2. You can hear yelling and a rising deep rumbling crescendo of noise, then a main battle tank bursts through the doors... and part of the wall. The top hatch opens, and Colonel @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ (the officer in charge of the "apprehension" of the unfortunate tourist) pops out. "Now you listen to me, @@LEADER@@, the last thing we need is more handsy-pansy suits getting in the way of our work! We should have no more requests to obliterate, signed in triplicate, sent in between 0800 and 1500 hours, sent back, queried, lost, found, subject to public inquiry, lost again, and finally discovered in the basement of @@CAPITAL@@ Library underneath a treatise about gummy worms!" The Colonel pulls a handgun the size of a small dog from his waistband and drops in onto the regulation almanac. The legs of your desk groan. "Give the military control over how to dispose of all these pesky law-breakers. We've been dying to test out these new [i]@@NAME@@-made Super Obliterator 3000s[/i], anyway!"

3. Your butler pours you a cup of tea, having materialized from the mysterious dimension butlers go to when they don't want to be noticed. "It appears to me, @@LEADER@@, that the problem lies within @@NAME@@ rather than without it. You can hardly blame people who visit our glorious cities for being in awe and thus forgetting their place and indeed, what place they are in." He places the delicate teacup on top of the obscenely large gun and size-of-a-child rulebook. "Having too many government committees, unnecessary departments, and too many soldiers can only lead to more debacles like this. Cut the administrative overgrowth, downsize the defense forces, and possibly funnel that money into something more productive, like education, or butler salaries." His thin mustache quivers expectantly.

4. The family of the dead tourist manages to climb over the armored vehicle in your doorway and into your office. The deceased's mother, who is especially distraught, approaches you with tears in her eyes. "Why does no one ever think of the people affected by all this! We're here to sight-see, not to get our family killed by your thugs! How does stepping off a park path even warrant deployment of a surface-to-air missile truck or a ninja team? We can't keep on going not knowing when the next of us will step out of line and be run over by a tank! We demand an apology, a change to the law and reparations!" The distraught woman gently places a photo of her dead son on your desk, which promptly collapses.

Your cousin's adored pet @@ANIMAL@@ has died.

The Debate
1. "It would mean the world to me to have my loss properly recognised," sobs your cousin, dabbing tears away with a gold-embroidered handkerchief. "My poor little baby deserves a state funeral. Imagine... people crying in the streets, a band playing funeral dirges on golden tubas, and my dearest little [i]@@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ McFluff[/i] immortalised in a memorial forever... you'd do it for your own pets, wouldn't you?"

[2]. "Y'know how many people this could feed?" asks roadkill-chef @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, sniffing at the carcass, and licking her lips. "And y'know how many people you're takin' cash away from with a big state funeral? Burying @@AN@@ @@ANIMAL@@ is a waste of good meat, and a waste of money. Y'should buy up all the dead pets, butcher them for meat, and donate the food to the poor and homeless." [[color=blue]Must not be vegetarian[/color]]

3. "No need to bury the wee beastie!" yells eccentric special effects expert @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I've been playing around a lot with taxidermy and animatronics, and I reckon if we fix up damage to the bodywork, apply some preservatives to stop the rot, install some motors and simple AI subroutines, and the little critter will be good as new! Also, why stop with pets? You miss your grandma, right? Let my company work its magic, and look who's back!"

[b][anchor=613]#613[/anchor]: A Nude Day, A Nude Awakening... [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Internet news sites and online communities are abuzz over supposed leaked nude images of you that surfaced online this morning. Amateur photo-manipulation experts have concluded that the images are fakes, but the files have already spread across the internet like wildfire. As the victim of this internet trolling campaign, it may be time for you to address the problem of faked images of this sort.

The Debate
1. "Here we have thieves and perverts, stealing your likeness and creating obscenity," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a country singer of dubious talent who claims there have been more downloads of fake nudes of @@HIM@@ than downloads of @@HIM@@ music. "Every time I go online I see these filthy pictures. It's humiliating, degrading, and feels like a violation of my privacy and a kind of sexual assault. I guess now you know how it feels too! I know this is hard to police, but you could at least make photo-manipulation without the consent of the subject illegal, with fines for those who break this law or who distribute these images."

2. "Kirby Streisand agrees, but Kirby Streisand thinks that we should go further," agrees the notorious Kirby Streisand, a staunch censorship advocate who once tried to remove all references to @@HIS@@ name on the internet. "If it were up to Kirby Streisand, any unauthorized image, name usage, or even a likeness of a person without their permission should automatically be taken down whether it's on the internet, the news, or any random video."

3. "Either everything is okay, or nothing is," refutes satirist and online columnist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whilst using a clever piece of software to make a mildly angry photo of you on a bad hair day look like you are a positively psychotic murderer on the verge of going on a killing spree. "Are you going to censor the Moaning Lisa because she was painted without her knowledge? Are you going to ban a schoolboy from drawing a moustache on a newspaper photo of your face? You have no right to censor art, and photo-manipulation is art. Quite frankly, celebrities and politicians should give up their expectations of privacy. If you don't want people drawing you nude, you shouldn't have chosen a career that makes you famous."

4. "Face it, you can't stop people putting things on the internet," suggests your tech-savvy nephew, who moonlights as notorious internet troll [i]politichunt42[/i]. "But you can affect an image's notability, by changing its context. Say we fake a few hundred nudes of a dozen other world leaders, and maybe some politicians and public figures you don't like: we could make it so that your faked nudes are old news, and have everyone laughing at your rivals and opponents instead. Wouldn't it be fun to watch them like flail around like a @@ANIMAL@@ with its head chopped off? Is it immoral? Sure, if somebody hadn't obviously already done this to you. Can you say 'hackers-sponsored-by-Blackacre'?"

[b][anchor=614]#614[/anchor]: How Much Is That Vote In The Window? [Burned Lands; ed: Nation of Quebec & Logophilia Lyricalia][/b]

The Issue
After recent elections in @@NAME@@, journalists calculated that over eighty percent of the money donated to candidates came from less than a dozen notable corporations. After years of protests about the corruption in the election system, several major voices have finally managed to sneak or bribe their way to your desk.

The Debate
1. "How could we let this happen?" moans Debbie Eugenia, spokesperson for Citizens United for Responsible, Sane Elections. "Well, it's pretty easy," @@HE@@ says as @@HE@@ shows you a complicated diagram linking various politicians to numerous corporations. "For years our nation's elections have been subverted by dark @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ from unaccountable private donors! You can see the chains of corruption laid out right here - go on, look at the flow chart!" Indeed, there are some prominent politicians' names on the chart, but you don't have time to make much of it before @@HE@@ continues. "It's long past time to put real limits on how much can be donated in an election! ARGH," @@HE@@ faints after being hit with a tranquilizer dart.

2. As your staffers drag the unconscious body of the activist away, two activist CEOs known as the Kone Sisters make their case. "Please don't listen to this wacko," pleads @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Kone, who donated over a million @@CURRENCY@@ to the mayor of @@CAPITAL@@'s campaign last year. "We need to be able to give freely if we want to truly represent our wealth - I mean, the people's voice! If anything, we should be thanking the donors for picking the right candidate." @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Kone, who donated to the mayor's rival last year, interjects. "Maybe we could dip into the government's coffers to refund their donations to the winning campaign. Think of it as a boon to competition – raising the stakes like that will lead to better business models and better candidates!"

3. Out of nowhere Hayek Freedman, Professor of Economics and Philosophy at the University of @@CAPITAL@@-Oldtown, falls through your ceiling, then still somehow manages to strut calmly to your desk. "Hold up a minute, @@LEADER@@. Neither of these lunatics knows what they're talking about. Allowing such huge campaign donations is incredibly wasteful; the whole economy would be better off without that drain. Yet we can't deny that indeed, corporations are people, my friend. So how is it we still haven't given them the right to vote? Economic justice means instead of 'one person, one vote,' we say 'one @@CURRENCY@@, one vote!' We'll just give natural persons AND corporations one vote for each @@CURRENCY@@ they earn every year. If you truly want to hear the voice of the people, not to mention cut way down on tax evasion, then let their wallets speak for them!" :kiss:

[b][anchor=615]#615[/anchor]: Tempted By The Fruit Of Another [A Humanist Science; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A Fruit Juicing Plant owned by farming conglomerate [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Farms[/i] proved unprofitable and was closed down when everything went pear-shaped, with local employees laid off in their hundreds. A few weeks later, its former workers broke through the padlocked gates and brought the machines inside back to life, starting a collectivist [i]@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Manufacturing Workers' Co-operative[/i] which soon turned a modest profit. Now the buildings' owners want their factory back. The workers' co-op has met the police in the streets, and things are about to go bananas.

The Debate
1. "This factory is mine! I have the deed right here!" yells [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Farms[/i] majority shareholder @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from the safety of a sea of well-armored riot police. "How do you like them apples? Really, it's precisely this sort of commie nonsense that is responsible for the economic downturn in @@NAME@@ to begin with! Everyone knows these lazy peasants don't have the plums to build a real enterprise. But, now that MY factory is turning a profit again, I'm happy to buy their labor! You know, at a small discount."

2. "Oh, so you have some quaint little deed? Who gives a fig?" asks @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, an award-winning documentary maker, while simultaneously signing copies of her new book [i]The Shock Logo[/i]. "Why does the law protect the rights of failed business owners while leaving the workers out in the cold? Haven't these workers also invested their very lives into this factory? Life gave them lemons, and they made lemonade! Don't sacrifice their families and their lives to that bunch of sour grapes... Change the law to allow workers to take direct and democratic control of abandoned factories!"

3. "Look, this 'self-management' thing sounds all peachy keen, but it just plays into the same tired capitalist narrative," says red turtleneck-clad political theorist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, while wrinkling his nose at a tattoo-laden protester. "Characterizing the suffering of the working class as merely an 'investment' plays directly into the hands of the bourgeoisie. And what do a bunch of pea-brained individuals know about proper management anyway? Can one factory provide jobs for all? Clearly, the state should seize factories for the good of all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@!"

[b][anchor=616]#616[/anchor]: You Are Feeling Very Very Sleepy And Not At All Gay [Golgothastan; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A controversial new health center has opened in @@CAPITAL@@, offering what it terms "spiritual counseling for young people confused about sex and gender". Critics charge that its practices amount to conversion therapy: trying to "cure" homosexuality by pressuring vulnerable teenagers.

The Debate
1. "Homosexuality is not something that needs to be 'cured' nor is it a choice!" fumes gay rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while burning a feather boa in protest. "We have fought so hard to be recognized as people with the same rights as everyone else, and now we have these quacks taking advantage of vulnerable young people with their religiously-inspired bigotry! Conversion therapy needs to be banned in @@NAME@@ and our rights protected!"

2. "No one is taking advantage of anyone," counters therapist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a self-declared gay conversion success story, giving it to you straight. "We simply offer a service to families requesting our intervention. Everything is completely voluntary and above board. Don't ban legitimate medical procedures just because you can't accept that sexual orientation is a choice! Some of these young people come to us in such a state of misery and confusion, and we offer them solace and comfort. We're doing the Almighty's work, after all."

3. "Compromise, compromise, compromise!" chants your Minister of Compromises and Trust Falls while organizing the next retreat for your cabinet. "If someone agrees to undergo so-called conversion therapy, then it's no business of the state to interfere in that. However, it should only be available to consenting adults. We also shouldn't allow parents to force their children to undergo these often humiliating therapies. So let's keep the centers operating, but only for adults who want the services."

[b][anchor=617]#617[/anchor]: Who's This Little Rascal? [The Aran Empire; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
On an expedition to one of the many lush forests in a distant colony, explorers have discovered a previously unknown furry four-legged marsupial. Apparently unsure of which other authority figure to turn to, they have brought the issue of naming the species to your attention.

The Debate
1. "We found this extraordinary specimen in a dense forest deep in the interior of Oogaboogaland," begins to explain the head of the expedition, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, proudly proffering the stuffed beastie in a display case. "It is new to us, but maybe the locals have seen it before and have a name for it. I say we just grab the first tribal native fella we come across, point to the thing, and see what name he gives it."

2. A rather dashing fellow with a swagger stick and a pith helmet approaches your desk, followed by a train of manservants bent double under his luggage. "Well, as our great nation is in control of their savage land, and the fact that it was we who were the first to find and officially document the varmint, I say we name it something that would be more appealing to the greater @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ culture."

3. "Oh whatever..." says your Minister of Simplicity, pushing aside their glass of tap water. "Why all the fuss for an animal that has about twenty look-alikes? Why not simply step up and declare that whoever discovers a new species, it gets named after them? That would save us a lot of time!"

4. "NO!" shouts the very patriotic governor of the colony, Viceroy @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Don't let this critter be named after any average Joe! It was you who the explorers have to thank for being able to go on that expedition in the first place, and it was you who established this colony for the betterment of our great nation! I say we name it after you, great @@LEADER@@!"

[b][anchor=618]#618[/anchor]: The Jaws Of A Dilemma [Team Rhysha; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
After a series of fatal attacks by @@ANIMAL@@ sharks on swimmers during prime vacation time, a debate has arisen over how to respond to the finned danger.

The Debate
1. "My sister was seriously hurt in one of the attacks," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a surfboard with a large chunk bitten out. "Okay, while that isn't the worst possible outcome, these @@ANIMAL@@ sharks are here and are very hungry. We need to properly protect the beaches from them. Guard boats! Shark watchers! Sonic deterrents! It might be expensive, but it's better than serving us up as a smorgasbord, right?"

2. "Oh, no, no, we can't have any of this," pleads local Mayor @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Vaughn, pulling at your sleeve for attention. "If you so much as mention the s-word, we'll have panic on our hands at peak holiday season, and cancellations coming out of our ear-holes! We're a summer town, and we need summer @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. Tell them it was a boat accident, that it's a beautiful day and that the beaches are open. Then talk about something else - anything - to distract their attention, and remind them why @@NAME@@ is @@REGION@@'s number one tourist destination!"

3. "It's not the @@ANIMAL@@ SHARKS that are the problem," pointedly declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, causing the Mayor to wince. "It's the people! The government should protect the sharks from the beach-goers and industries that steal their food and habitat, forcing them to come closer to humans. The sharks were there first! Just put 'No Swimming' signs along the beach."

4. "These @@ANIMAL@@ sharks offer us an opportunity," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Tourism, poring over plans for oceanfront tourism development. "Think about it. How much are people willing to pay to see sharks up close? It'll surely attract tons of new visitors to our beaches and aquariums, and we could make a fortune from cage diving. Sure, some people might get chowed upon, but it's for the experience, you know?"

5. "Seems like you got a shark problem on your hands," nonchalantly mutters Quant, a rugged fisherman and captain of the Okra, caressing a harpoon gun. "I've been fishing on the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Bay since before I could walk, I served on the S.S. @@CAPITAL@@ that sunk. I've seen these sharks up close; they've got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes. I'll take care of your shark problem, so long as I get paid handsomely. But I'll need a bigger boat."

[b][anchor=619]#619[/anchor]: X Marks The Cult? [Tykadoro; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A plot of land, which is simultaneously where the founder of the Order of Violet was allegedly born, where the Tranquility of Yellow claims the Goddess will descend, and where the Cult of Pizza plans to build its temple called The Pizza Church of Pepperoni, has been claimed by all three religions. The three religions' leaders have cornered you after another ribbon cutting ceremony and have demanded that you settle their conflict.

The Debate
1. "The Dead Ocean Scrolls clearly state that us Violetists are the real owners of this land!" declares the Grand Purplmistress of Violetism as she makes threatening gestures towards you and the other leaders. "We deserve to be able to practice our hum, err, animal sacrifices, so why can't we go along, take the land, and do it there? No one else is as cra- I mean, unique as we are. The only thing we ask are only a few million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to build our temple, and everything else will be taken care of."

2. "Those scrolls are nothing but mistranslated hogwash! All of this area belongs to us!" asserts Her Jaundiceness, the eccentric and indecisive leader of the Tranquility of Yellow. "Those idiotic Violetists and believers in @@FAITH@@ only care about the majority of people in @@NAME@@. What about the minority, the ones that believe invisible dragons fly around, and that everyone should pay for, uh, make a personal sacrifice to the great Advertising Billboard? We would freely allow all of them to come in and listen to our completely objective teachings. Now as for the majority... they'll just be banned from coming. What, you thought we would KILL them? We're not that crazy..."

3. "All must hail His Immaculate Munchiness!" announces @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a former Luigi Bros pizzeria owner who claims that the franchise's insane prices literally sent him to a mental hospital. "We are aware that other religions should be allowed to exist in this world, yet these two are claiming the land for inhumane and overall unusual reasons, in the Cult of Pizza's opinion. The church we will build will have a free pizza buffet for all! The only cost? Well, we aren't really building a real 'church' per se. We are actually building a pizza store with a church inside of it. That's a small price to pay for His Holy Crustiness!"

4. "You know, you honestly don't have to listen to any of these screwballs." bemoans your politically ambitious cousin, who has been giving you poor leadership advice since you became leader of @@NAME@@. "You can use the area to do other things like, I don't know, weave baskets? Whatever the case is, it would be much better to do this than let any of these insane religions take a perfectly viable plot of land. Oh, I will also own the plot of land, not you. You know, to avoid a conflict of interest or whatever. You do trust me, right?"

5. "Have you forgotten what I told you about sharing and compromise?" reminds your mother, who returned from a shopping spree at the store you just opened. "Why not force all those religions to share this plot of land? Divide it up into three separate spaces with a communal center in the middle. Some may not like sharing the ground with their mortal enemies and you'll need extra police presence to curb potential violence, but fair's fair, right?"
