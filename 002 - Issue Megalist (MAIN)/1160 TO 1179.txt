[b][anchor=1160]#1160[/anchor]: Milking It [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
@@DEMONYMADJETIVE@@ consumers have seen the prices of dairy products continue to skyrocket, seemingly without reason. However, a recent exposé by an investigative journalist has finally shed light on this situation: the three largest dairy producers in @@NAME@@ have conspired to fix prices.

The Debate
1. "Shame! Shame! Down with the cartels!" chants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an angry protestor, ringing a cow bell in sync with @@HIS@@ slogans. "We've had to pay exorbitant prices for basic dairy foodstuffs, all because a bunch of industry fat cats decided they wanted to rip us off! You should immediately implement strict antitrust laws across all industries to prevent such collusions, and make these price-fixers pay a sizeable deterrent fine."

2. "What? Holy cow! We were just trying to, uh, help our farmers!" exclaims Curd Holstein, CEO of [i]MooMoo Pure Dairy[/i]. "Supermarket price wars were driving milk rates so low that dairy farmers were running at a loss, and struggling to make ends meet. Our noble goal was to improve their lot by increasing the prices, but nobody appreciates us! You should support and congratulate us, @@LEADER@@, as well as provide subsidies to the dairy industry."

3. "It's a shame that we have to pay for basic commodities like this," muses embittered socialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Look, imagine you have two cows and... no, wait, that doesn't work. What I mean to say is that the government should pay producers a fixed tariff, and then supply a milk ration directly to the people. That will prevent greedy businesspeople from endangering people's health for profit, and ensure that nobody will go to bed hungry!"

The Issue
An anonymous whistleblower leaked evidence that despite banning political parties, powerful and secret blocs of politicians have begun unofficially helping each other pass and defeat legislation, effectively rendering the ban pointless.

The Debate
1. "I cannot believe the nerve of these people!" fumes independent MP @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while making threatening gestures at @@HIS@@ rivals in the room. "Here we are, trying to run a government free of partisan politics, and instead we have what's effectively a party trying to undermine the system! Everyone involved in these blocs must be expelled from office before they take over the government!"

2. "I'm shocked, shocked!" sarcastically replies a former Opposition backbencher while making a tally of the MPs surrounding you. "Of course, we wouldn't have this problem if we had political parties. What you should do is reinstate national parties, and install some sort of... oh, let's say 'quota' for each one. That way, people with opposing viewpoints will be fairly represented, and no one would be more powerful than anyone else."

3. "No way! This has been the greatest idea you've ever had!" exclaims independent MP and professional suck-up @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The fact that people elected us like-minded officials should tell you what they really want - and what they want is for us to implement your agenda. So why not cut out the middleman and henceforth ban all elections in Socialist Democratic Communes? Blackacre manages well enough without them. That way, you can impose your agenda without any opposition getting in the way!"

The Issue
Your Minister for Anti-Homosexuality, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, was recently arrested for sleeping with a transwoman who possessed male genitals. Homosexuality is illegal in @@NAME@@, but many around you are unsure if his actions count as breaking the law. In chains and on his knees, the fallen minister waits for you to decide his fate.

The Debate
1. "Oh @@LEADER@@, thank you for allowing me this audience!" cries the relieved Willy. "You know that I fully support the homosexuality ban. I am straight, and I'm not at all attracted to men. My lover is not a man. She's a woman, and what I was doing with her was completely legal. She just so happens to still have a penis, that's all. Please, release both of us and I'll work hard to take down all the hidden homosexuals in this nation."

*2. "Either way, he is still a deviant pervert," contends the bearded Acting Minister for Anti-Homosexuality. "We must clarify that our laws cover this sort of abhorrent behavior; a penis is not a technicality! Although I'm sure our friend here has been enjoying his time in chains, I say we make an example out of this debauchee and hang both him and his plaything."

[[color=red]Must have capital punishment[/color]]

4. "Just because a person is trapped in the body of the opposite sex, doesn't mean they should automatically be perceived as gay," asserts the limp-wristed Sub-Minister for Anti-Homosexuality. "They're actually attracted to their opposite sex; they just happen to be that sex at the same time... involuntarily. It can be confusing, I'll grant you that. To avoid further muddle, I propose the government provide funds for all transsexual individuals to undergo mandatory sex reassignment surgery."

5. "Or..." shouts your resident poet @@RANDOM_NAME@@, followed by an overly long pause for dramatic effect. "You step out of the shadowlands, shift course and sail the ship of @@NAME@@ on great winds bearing perfume and warmth, towards a shore where love is love and to love is never a crime." Looking at the blank faces of your ministers, he sighs and turns to you. "You know, just legalize it, man."

[b][anchor=1163]#1163[/anchor]: Some Assembly Required [Austral Coast; ed: Altmer Dominion][/b]

The Issue
After an ill-advised demonstration during a floor speech on chemical safety standards, the national legislative building is in need of extensive renovations. Leading architects, lawmakers and political scientists have arranged a meeting with you to discuss designs for the new assembly chamber.

The Debate
1. "We should look to the Parliament of Brancaland for inspiration," pants opposition leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, taking a break from shouting into @@HIS@@ phone. "Two sets of benches: one for my Opposition and allies, the other for the current Government and their accomplices. From just over two sword lengths apart within the Clerkship's square should we look our enemies — ahem — colleagues in the eye and have a straightforward debate about the issues facing @@NAME@@. Besides, I like right angles. If only my colleagues on the other side shared the same appreciation..."

2. "The Brancalandian legislature is infamous for running into gridlock," warns senior legislator @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I surmise that a traditional semicircle would be best. Tried and true by many classical governments throughout the ages, it shall add an air of gravitas to all proceedings. With an emphasis on non-fixed seating placing parliament members of different backgrounds next to one another, you'll find the opposition less concerned with putting up a visible fight and better focused on finding ways to get the actual work of governing done."

3. "There's no time for half-measures!" declares wide-eyed celebrity architect @@RANDOM_NAME@@, laying out a rather large floor plan on your desk. "I have plans to install a grand circular skylight above the assembly while expanding the visitor gallery to three full floors. Underneath it all, there'd be no seats, only an unbridled tide of legislators flowing over concentric circles of colour. What better way to illustrate the complexity and beauty of politics unbound?"

4. "What a waste of taxpayer money," grumbles your mustachioed adviser Don Duckson, whittling down a block of wood. "Don't humor these petulant children; just have podiums at the front for the leadership with rows of solid oak desks for everyone else. It's simple and efficient. I don't see what else we have to discuss here."

The Issue
A vast and seemingly endless new cave system has just been discovered in a remote section of Violetstone National Park! Despite not even having a name yet, petitioners are crowding your office telling you what to do with it.

The Debate
1. "I'm ready. Let's do this!" shouts renowned adrenaline junkie, Weevil Knievel, waving a headlamp at you. "I am going to be the first person to ever explore this cave. It would be yet another feather in the cap of my already stellar career! Yes, I know it's a nine day off-road trek into sensitive ecosystems. Yes, I know it will be fraught with danger and intrigue. That's the whole point! Give me the green light... and, while you're at it, a camera crew."

2. "You can't be serious?" chastises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of the advocacy group 'No Safety, Know Pain'. "Who knows what kind of beasts and perils might be lurking in there? Imagine this @@LEADER@@: a good, wholesome @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ family, out having a picnic in the splendor of Violetstone National Park.

3. "Whoop-dee-doo, there's a new cave! Get over it," snorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of Violetstone's junior rangers. "You know what else is still there? Any number of trees, flowers, bunnies — you name it — all happily undisturbed by human activities. I say we keep it that way with a boost to the park budget. With more money, we can crack down on anyone who tries to illegally enter prohibited areas."

[b][anchor=1165]#1165[/anchor]: Crosswords Beget Angry Letters [Lislandia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A major national newspaper is taking heat after one of its crossword puzzles contained the answer 'BIGWIGS', which is considered a racial slur by Bigtopians. This is not the first time the paper has come under fire for its puzzling word choices, and concerned citizens are squaring off outside your door in hopes of filling in the blanks for you.

The Debate
1. "Get a clue, @@LEADER@@!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Civil Liberties Alliance, as @@HE@@ snaps one of your pencils in half. "It is well known throughout @@REGION@@ that the B-word is a degrading term referring to members of our nation's Bigtopian community. There is only one solution: demand that the paper fire those who permitted this puzzle to go to print. That should send a warning to everyone that such disrespect and callousness will never be tolerated!"

2. "What's a five-letter word that means 'iciness'?" inquires Bill Pantz, crossword editor for the newspaper in question, glancing up from a recent puzzle submission he is proofreading. "Oh, that's right, 'CHILL!' Look, the word 'bigwigs' simply refers to elitist fat cats, as was clued in the puzzle. On rare occasions, perfectly legitimate words that have sometimes been used as slurs like 'porp', 'beepus', or 'jonky', are fair use in a puzzle. Apologies to anyone who was offended, but that's where the matter ends. That's as black-and-white as it gets."

*3. "Solving this puzzle requires us to think outside the box," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chairperson of the Committee on Appropriate Language in Media. "This problem indicates a lack of varied perspectives within the corporate and media worlds. We should look to promote greater diversity in the workplace, which means instituting government-mandated sensitivity training, financial incentives for companies who hire from certain target groups, and increased funding for programs that seek the advancement of underrepresented communities. It will be expensive, but can we really put a price on inclusivity?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

5. "This wouldn't even be a problem if we nationalized the media!" exclaims Manny Festaux, your Minister of Orwellian Orthodoxy. "Imagine how much easier it would be to pick and choose the content that was published in the dailies. Not only that, but you won't have to worry anymore about negative publicity directed at you!

The Issue
Upon the planned completion of their vacation estate in northern @@NAME@@, a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ billionaire has additionally, and unexpectedly, purchased the vast bulk of a large forest adjacent to their property for the sole purpose of stocking and hunting @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@.

The Debate
1. "Nobody should have a right to that much land!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the mayor of @@ANIMAL@@ Grove. "That forest has sustained this town for years! Tradespeople responsibly take lumber, families near and far hike the trails, and there's a thriving birdwatching industry. All these people depend on the land and this charlatan just suddenly squats on it! What a waste. Not only should this particular forest be returned to us, @@NAME@@ needs to conduct a thorough review of these land holdings and reverse this practice of theft once and for all." 

2. "What poppycock! I have grand plans for this forest!" exclaims the shocked billionaire who can be seen wearing a wide-brimmed sunhat. "I'm planning on fashioning my own private hunting forest. There are some remarkably rare animals here that would look simply lovely on my wall. That said, while I may be inclined to hunt, our country's finer citizens might wish to augment their holdings instead. Only the wealthiest have the presence of mind to academically appreciate the gifts of Mother Nature. If you encourage them to commit to further woodland area purchases, @@NAME@@ will surely see a diversity of forest management techniques." 

3. "What incredible selfishness!" protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a conservationist. "Who do these people think they are? It's neither the town nor the rich snob's forest! Nobody should own it! Both groups have visions of exploitation borne out of their own self-centeredness. The government must protect all public land from these hearts of greed and from those monsters who would use that land to hunt innocent animals for sport."

[b][anchor=1167]#1167[/anchor]: Another Brick in the Wall [Sacara; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
A devastating earthquake occurred near the eastern border of @@NAME@@ last night, taking down a large section of the border wall in the process. To the surprise of the construction workers who showed up this morning, the area was filled by a group of masked people protesting against the rebuilding effort.

The Debate
1. "There's no reason why this should stop the repair work, no reason at all!" exclaims Minister of Barriers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pushing aside a protestor to make a start on boarding up the hole. "First round up all these troublesome demonstrators and arrest them. Then make this restoration our top priority, we need to make this wall even bigger and better than before – build it at least ten feet higher in the area where it fell."

2. "The wall was a bad idea in the first place," asserts one of the masked protestors. "Why do we need such a draconian immigration policy anyway? There are people fleeing wars and persecution who only wish to come here to live life in peace. @@LEADER@@, use this opportunity not to build a wall, but to embrace a new era of openness for @@NAME@@."

3. "Perhaps we could ease up on the immigration law just a bit?" advocates Zeke Fox, a long-time advisor who has a knack of creating compromises. "Instead of 'wall' or 'no wall', why don't we turn this newly acquired gap into an official border crossing? Then any foreigner who wishes to come to our great @@TYPE@@ can go through the proper channels – controlled immigration: no riff-raff, just the cream of the crop. It will also make vacations to our eastern neighbors easier, I hear they have a great water festival this time of the year."

4. "How about we address the real problem? The wall wasn't structurally sound!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Immigration Minister. "How can we ever claim to keep our border secure if a measly earthquake can just knock it down? It's time we fund a massive renovation of the entire wall – to ensure that it can stand against any act of nature. While we're at it, this wall could do with a few sentry turrets, a barbed-wire top, and landmines, lots of landmines!"

[b][anchor=1168]#1168[/anchor]: Too Much Too Young [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The International Humanitarian Aid Coordination Committee (IHACC) has recently produced an eight-hundred page document examining causes of political instability, terrorist radicalisation, and wealth inequalities. The overall conclusion is that an absence of easily available contraception in the poorest nations in the world may be a key underlying factor to many global ills.

The Debate
1. "Geostatistical analysis and extrapolation has established within a quasi-estimated p-value that is likely to be less than 0.05 that the burden of children during teenage years results in disparities in gender power gaps, deficits in democratic engagement and exacerbation of cycles of poverty," spiels IHACC Directorate Investigator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, without pausing for breath. "Under reference of six separate resolutions relating to equality and advancement of civil rights, referenced in Appendices VII.4 to VII.5, you must now contribute to worldwide family planning services, to the sum of 650 million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. Do you want to pay by cash or card?"

2. "Don't see why it's a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ problem to pay for condoms in poverty-stricken hellholes," complains Treasury Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, proudly pinning a '@@NAME@@ First' badge to @@HIS@@ lapel. "Give me a day or two, and I'll have our International Treaties department draw up some legal objections that will defer the payments ad infinitum. Then, we'll be able to spare our taxpayers the burden of forking out for the sexual promiscuity of foreign nations."

3. TBD

4. "Give me one moment of your time," interjects surprisingly polite Tasmanian militia boss Whit Houston, climbing in through your window with an assault rifle in hand. "I believe that children are our future. We teach them well, and let them show the way, as minefield scouts and pre-teen soldiers. If contraceptives are brought in, we'll be losing real manpower. Or boypower. Why not work with me to supply arms to the Tasmanian Freedom Army? I just wanna trade with somebody. Hey!" He yells in surprise as your bodyguard bursts into the room and drags him out.

Last week, rowdy schoolchildren toppled and broke a priceless ancient Maxtopian statue in the National Museum, then took selfies with the statue's cracked head. Now, many curators across @@NAME@@ are demanding that anyone under the age of 13 be banned from museums.

The Debate
1. "Why do parents want to bring their kids to our museums?" weeps curator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, mournfully cradling the head of the decapitated statue. "Inevitably, the little hooligans run around yelling and touching everything. What's more, having children about inevitably results in museums being dumbed-down, with shiny interactive displays and silly flashing lights. One museum I went to had a ball pit in the basement! A ball pit! Young children should be excluded, and we should be refocusing museums on preserving and celebrating our culture and history."

2. "Oh, get off your high horse," retorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, mother of three self-proclaimed 'dinosaur hunters' who are currently jumping up and down on your desk. "It's unconscionable that we are even debating shutting the museum door on kids. Denying children entry will only hurt @@NAME@@ in the long run. In fact, all children should have free entry guaranteed, and museums must be made to be more kid-friendly!"

3. "I, like, can't see why museums are even still a thing," complains teenager @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ @@ANIMAL@@, in a bland monotone. "Just last week my school, like, made my class go on a field trip to a museum or something. It was like the most boring thing ever.

"We're dedicating our lives to improving science and the arts, all for the greater good of @@NAME@@. And what do we get in return?

A highly publicized data leak from Maxtopia has revealed classified military projects studying ESP, astral projection, mind-reading and other psychic-related phenomena.

The Debate
1. "Just look at the things Maxtopia was experimenting with!" exclaims General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ fiddling with a tinfoil 'projection' cap. "There's mind-reading devices, brain-expansion exercises, this 'Dream Twister' secret project, and so much more! I mean, just imagine the potential strategic advantages on the battlefield, or in intelligence operations! Even if it comes to nothing, can you risk letting them get ahead of us?

2. "Research alone is not taking this far enough!" proclaims purportedly psychokinetic guru @@RANDOM_NAME@@, offering you a copy of @@HIS@@ self-help book [i]Moving Forward[/i]. "The full potential of the human mind is an infinite power beyond this puny material world! A psychic soldier could stop their enemy's heart with a thought, and smash tanks with a wave of the hand.

3. "Oh please, don't tell me you've fallen for this nonsense as well!" moans famed debunker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "All these projects amounted to nothing: nada, zilch, zero!

"Without school newspapers, how are we supposed to find out when my little @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME's next soccer match is going to take place or how @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@'s mom is flirting with the math teacher to raise her child's grades? People should be able to publish periodicals of non-political content without requiring government permission. Also, release our children immediately, or I'll set the PTA on you!"

2. "Whoa, are you out of your mind?" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Truth, grabbing the newspaper from the angry parent's hand and tossing it into the portable incinerator he drags around for this specific purpose. "How can we prevent the dissemination of fake news if we allow private media to exist? We should clamp down on all audacious attempts to mislead public opinion by contradicting state-approved news!"

3. "Hail thee, our most wise and glorious @@LEADER@@!" shouts out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a political commentator from the state-owned @@CAPITAL@@ Chronicles, who used to work for a dissident newspaper before it was shut down. "I would not doubt the wisdom of your decree, but why only periodicals of non-political content? Why should only people employed by the State be granted the privilege to sing your praises? How about all the aspiring journalists who are yearning to commend your most magnificent achievements? You should allow private media sources to publish political news as well, like the true leader you are."

4. "Well... we could just allow these kids to publish their newspaper but also ensure that they don't get up to any mischief," chimes in your Minister of Alternative Solutions, peeking and whispering through from the other side of your office door's keyhole. "We could simply require that all media organs, including school newspapers, be supervised by a government-appointed agent. If we happen to detect a sign of dissent, our agents can nip it in the bud."

[b][anchor=1175]#1175[/anchor]: Can I Borrow a Word? [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
A group of disgruntled language connoisseurs are complaining that loan-words from the Galliennais language are 'contaminating the native tongue of @@NAME@@' . They are calling for a government sponsored language purification project, robbing you of your joie de vivre as you try to relax and enjoy your pamplemousse cocktail.

The Debate
1. "This is a disgrace!" exclaims Harold Hastings, a linguist from @@CAPITAL@@ University, slamming the latest edition of the Maxford @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Dictionary on your desk. "These nasty Galliennais words — full of nasal sounds — have started to invade our glorious language. We should immediately launch this project in order to replace these hideous loan-words with their pristine @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ counterparts. My colleagues and I already have some suggestions on the table: 'eggy flapjacks' for 'omelette', and how about 'hey-I've-seen-this-before' for 'déjà vu'? All we need to publish a comprehensive list is a generous subsidy on your part."

2. "Oh mon dieu, but this approach will not work, as it doesn't target the raison d'être for Galliennais loan-words," enunciates William Norman, an enthusiastic Galliennais Literature professor from Cambarry University, with visible ennui. "The Galliennais culture is superior to ours, and so is their langue, par conséquent we need Galliennais words to express high-brow concepts such as rapprochement, savoir-faire, and je ne sais quoi. The importation of Galliennais words is fait accompli, and trying to reverse this will only be a faux pas. Let us embrace and teach to all Galliennais words and linguistic diversity: vive la différence!"

3. "Bah, humbug!" grunts bellicose General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, while angrily smashing a Galliennais Merlot bottle on the floor. "We don't have to tolerate this nonsense; let's bomb Galliennes into the ground and colonize them. Then they'll learn [i]our[/i] language soon enough!"

[b][anchor=1176]#1176[/anchor]: Haters Gonna Hate [Skottengrad; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Underground internet sensation @@ANIMAL@@man has been using a computer-generated voice to create parodies of various rap songs that promote racism, xenophobia, and bigotry. However, many suspect that @@ANIMAL@@man is not actually an individual, but is an assumed identity used by a large number of anonymous internet users.

The Debate
1. "@@ANIMAL@@man must be stopped!" rages middle-aged conservative @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Look at these songs! [i]Bigtopian Lives Don't Matter[/i]? [i]Remove All Violetists[/i]? [i]Lilliputians (Stomp on Them)[/i]? These songs are a disgrace to humanity! We must show the world we won't stand for this! Video streaming companies must be forced to find and take down offensive content like this, and be faced with hefty fines if they fail to do so."

2. "These older folks don't get it; @@ANIMAL@@man is nothing but a harmless joke!" says civil service intern, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "Sure, there will be some who actually believe in this stuff, but the satirists creating these songs are parodying hate speech. You have to stand up for the right to create parody! Plus maybe they're just angry about being powerless and unappreciated juniors in a monolithic bureaucracy, with a line manager who never says thanks when he brings her morning coffee. Uh, so I would imagine, anyway..."

3. "I think this issue is more serious than we realize," whispers Intelligence Agency Director @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "An anonymous group dividing our country? That doesn't sound like something spontaneous. This seems more like something Blackacre would do. They've been trying to undermine @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ society for decades. If you want to stop @@ANIMAL@@man, you must stop disinformation. A well-funded counter-terrorism cyber-unit with the freedom to act decisively will stop this threat!"

4. "You know, it's the anonymity of the internet that allows this hate speech," observes one of your aides. "What if we just turned off the internet? Think about it: no more @@ANIMAL@@man, no more trolls, no more lying dating profiles with misleading pictures wasting my time... hey, it's a win for everyone!"

[b][anchor=1177]#1177[/anchor]: A Funny Old Game [Outer Sparta; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Although your nation put in a strong proposal to host the next International Football Federation (IFF) Global Cup, your bid was rejected. Instead, the oil-rich nation of Althaniq won, despite a near total lack of football infrastructure. Many are blaming this decision on bribery and corruption on a massive scale.

The Debate
1. "It was rigged!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the @@NAME@@ Football Association (@@NAME_INITIALS@@FA). "Althaniq bribed the IFF and bought the rights to host! The IFF's directors need to be held to account for its corruption in a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ court of law! Demand their extradition to the @@TYPE@@, and we could clean up football!"

2. "Are you kidding me?" shouts IFF head honcho Joe Splatter, fidgeting with a conspicuously shiny new gold ring. "Althaniq presented to us the best bid! Even if they never hosted before, and have no stadiums, or training facilities, or football clubs... or footballs. Look, the point is that this is outside your jurisdiction. Keep out of our business dealings, and in return we'll send a few political donations your way. You win, we win."

3. "Who cares where the tournament is held?" asks @@NAME@@ team captain @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dribbling all over your office carpet. "We're going to represent our nation on the world stage, and we don't want to disappoint our fans! There'll be breathtaking goals, heroic tackles and lucrative sponsorship deals! Who cares about scandals? Just put some government money into our team to get us the best high-tech training facilities, and help us deliver what really matters — Global Cup victory!"

[b][anchor=1178]#1178[/anchor]: No Need to Beat Yourself Up About It [Baggieland; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
Now is the Holy Week of the religion of the Tranquility of Yellow. Seven days of divine celebration climax on the last day, when young men and boys self-flagellate in the streets in order to prove their devotion to their god. This display is always a bloody spectacle, and sometimes participants end up in hospital.

The Debate
1. "This is a horrid exhibition," declares @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a young mother who had to dodge the self-flagellants as she brought her kids home from school. "How can this primitive horror show be permitted in our civilized society? At the end of the day, there's so much blood in the street that it looks like a battlefield. Ban this frightful demonstration and force those Yellowite weirdos to pray nicely!"

2. "Yes, blood in the street never looks good," concurs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Chief of Police. "Foreign news agencies that aren't friendly towards us always claim that the blood comes from @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ police brutality. Be that as it may, we can't give them fuel to add to their fire. Tell these Yellowites that if they must flog themselves, do it inside their own homes — not on the streets!"

3. "If eternal damnation is what you seek, @@LEADER@@, then go ahead and ban it," smugly declares Sebastian Sienna, a Yellowite priest, as his nurse tends to his many wounds. "The week of Holy Yellow has been observed for a thousand years, and the act of scourging ourselves en masse is the pinnacle of the week! We must be allowed to follow our religious ideals without hindrance: the commandments say that we need to be punished. In fact, it wouldn't hurt if the government be more supportive of us flagellants: start portraying Holy Yellow in a more positive way, and let's see some advertisements about the benefits of self-flagellation. Yes... just like that!" The priest screams in ecstasy as his nurse tends to a particularly deep wound.

*4. "That's not a bad idea," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the principal of your niece's school, who came to your office to discuss the best way to discipline your wayward niece. "Everyone's going on these days about how corporal punishment on kids should be banned. I guess we could spank them less to satisfy the bleeding hearts. And thus, in order to still maintain order in schools, we should make a law that forces kids to punish themselves: 'Timmy, you didn't do your homework — whip yourself for ten minutes'. It's perfect!" [[color=purple]Must have corporal punishment[/color]]

*5. "That's not a bad idea," muses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the principal of your niece's school, who came to your office to discuss the best way to discipline your wayward niece. "Because we don't allow the use of corporal punishment on children, our kids are out of control! Since teachers aren't allowed to physically caution the children, we should make a law that forces kids to punish themselves: 'Timmy, you didn't do your homework — whip yourself for ten minutes'. It's perfect!" [[color=purple]Must not have corporal punishment[/color]]

[b][anchor=1179]#1179[/anchor]: Nothing Fishy [Ransium; ed: Ransium & Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Due to the recent popularity of [i]Beards of Fishermen[/i] Magazine, @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ have decided to buy their own offshore fishing boats in droves. Based on the number of fishing permit applications, the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Fish and Game Department has suggested that dividing a reasonable quota equally between requesting boats would mean each would be allowed to catch no more than seventeen fish each year.

The Debate
1. "The problem is capitalism," opines noted socialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who also blamed a recent stubbed toe on capitalism. "The state must take over the fishing industry entirely. Then the optimal fleet size and optimal fish catch for each boat can be determined by the state yearly according to the fish populations. It would also mean we'd spend less on quota enforcement because any boat which wasn't state-owned would be clearly illegal."

2. "The problem is government interventionism," states noted libertarian @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who also blamed a recent hangnail on the government. "Let's end this socialism of the sea! The government must sell its ownership of offshore waters to private entities. It will then be the property owners' responsibility to determine who fishes, how much, and how enforcement is done. Don't worry about sustainability; it will be in the property owners' interest to make sure fishing continues in the long term."

3. "No, the problem here is these extreme positions," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, author of recent bestseller [i]Fishanomics[/i]. "You just need to auction off a limited number of permits for a share of the total fish catch each year. The invisible hand of government-regulated capitalism will assure the optimal number of boats run only by the most efficient crew will do the fishing at the perfect permit price."

4. "I have ah simplah solution than all that," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an eccentric, salt of the sea boat repairer. "The problem is that modern technology has made commercial fishin' as easy as, well, shootin' fish in ah barrel. Get rid of the quota system and instead force all fishin' to be done with old fashioned methods, and sail boats, and folk wisdom. Those hipstah fishahmen won't catch a thing and enforcement will be much cheapah than it evah was for any quota system."
