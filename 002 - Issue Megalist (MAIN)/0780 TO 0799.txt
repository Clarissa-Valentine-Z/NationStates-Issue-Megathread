[b][anchor=780]#780[/anchor]: Vexing VAT [Nuremgard; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
A collection of shoppers and business owners have gathered outside your office to protest over the current levels of value-added tax - the sales tax that is applied to products and services at the time of purchase - also known as VAT.

The Debate
1. "It's outright theft, I say!" exclaims business owner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while restocking a display with mugs exhibiting your image. "Why should the state leech off my success? I've had customers walk out of my store in a huff because the VAT jacked up the prices. The government could easily make money through other kinds of tax instead of harming my business. I say we get rid of this ridiculous VAT altogether and let our economy thrive without limits!"

2. "Are you mad?" scoffs bureaucrat @@RANDOM_NAME@@, twirling @@HIS@@ bespoke pen. "Do you have any idea how much the national treasury takes in through VAT? It helps pay for all kinds of things! Education, welfare, defence, and so on. The point is, this form of tax is a very valuable part of our taxation code that, if removed, would leave many public works bereft of funds. I say we increase VAT, and use the funds we raise to reduce the despicable income tax that bleeds the hard-working people of @@NAME@@ dry."

3. "As always, there is a third option," muses a passer-by with a voice of confidence. "There is no doubt that this tax disproportionately affects the poor, but we also can't deny that it helps fund programmes that the poor themselves benefit from. Might I suggest reducing VAT on basic necessities while increasing it on luxury items? The rich might not like it, but it's high time that they paid their dues to society and their fellow citizens."

The Issue
Albinos - born with an absence of pigment in their eyes, skin or hair - suffer a lot of medical problems as a result of their condition. Additionally, they can often face multiple forms of discrimination, and some even believe that their bodies possess extraordinary health benefits and magic powers. Following a brutal attack on an albinistic teenager, which left him armless and disfigured, you have been urged to address their persecution.

The Debate
1. "Decapitations, infanticides, kidnappings, and amputations! It's beyond the pale!" weeps @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, mother of the now hospitalised victim of the attack. "These are the dangers that albinos face every day. This must end! It should be illegal for anyone to discriminate against albinos, and that includes the media. In fact, make it easier to be an albino in @@NAME@@: give them free eye care, police protection, welfare support, and a lifetime supply of sunscreen!"

2. "This isn't a black and white issue, and skin-deep solutions won't tackle the root causes," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a divisive atheist demagogue. "Ignorance and superstition are to blame for all this, so let's stamp them out. Raise awareness about what albinism is and isn't. Teach people that albinos are normal @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, just like you and me. We must erase the absurd primitive thinking that drives these attacks. Teach rationality, teach science, teach atheism!"

*3. "Albinos definitely possess magicks beyond this realm," bellows the self-proclaimed Witch of @@CAPITAL@@, whose person is adorned with amulets made of albino body parts. "Trust me, I'm also a doctor. The hair of an albino is a cure for many afflictions, including blindness, cancer and brain freezes. The tears of an orphaned albino child will remedy a broken heart. Therefore, the government must support my endeavor to bring the gifts of the albino to all in @@NAME@@ by setting up albino hunting guilds and farms. The nation can even benefit by sacrificing an albino every now and then for victory in war or a bountiful harvest!" [[color=purple]Must have unlocked @@CAPITAL@@[/color]]

*4. "Albinos definitely possess magicks beyond this realm," bellows the self-proclaimed Witch of the Wilds, whose person is adorned with amulets made of albino body parts. "Trust me, I'm also a doctor. The hair of an albino is a cure for many afflictions, including blindness, cancer and brain freezes. The tears of an orphaned albino child will remedy a broken heart. Therefore, the government must support my endeavor to bring the gifts of the albino to all in @@NAME@@ by setting up albino hunting guilds and farms.

[5]. "Within the Ashen Ones, the spirit of the divine dwells," proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Grand High Poobah of the Order of Violet. "Their eyes, the windows to the soul, reveal this to be Truth. One observes the lavender ghost of the great Mistress Violet typing within, Her presence on earth made physical. That is why the rest of their bodies lack any color; the whole existence of the albino is devoted to housing the Holy. It is written; they must be revered! Pay tribute to our albino masters, @@LEADER@@, and lay your nation's riches at their feet." [[color=blue]Must allow Violetism[/color]]

[b][anchor=782]#782[/anchor]: Sit-Down Money [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
With traffic congestion on the roads of @@CAPITAL@@ reaching unbearable density, labour unions are demanding that employees be paid overtime wages for time spent in traffic jams.

The Debate
1. "Have mercy on us, @@LEADER@@!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, honking @@HIS@@ car horn right under your window. "I've been stuck in this damned traffic jam for so long I've forgotten what my children look like! It is inhumane to spend four hours every day just trying to commute to work and back home! I deserve to be paid overtime wages to compensate for the stress I endure!"

2. "What is this noise?" asks your secretary @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Karoshi, crawling out from under @@HIS@@ desk, still wrapped in @@HIS@@ blanket. "Tell these softies that nobody is forcing them to drive back home after work. People whose homes are far away from work should be encouraged to sleep over at their offices and only go home once a week or so. This would also help boost their company loyalty. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to take a quick shower. The garden sprinklers are on, right?"

3. "I'm not sure why it's government business what our corporate pay structures are," observes well-rested CEO @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose commute involved a 15-minute private helicopter trip. "The labour unions always have one demand or another, but we can deal with these problems with hardball negotiation, judicious hiring and firing, and failing all else, water cannon. How about government stays out of it, and lets us resolve these pay disputes our own way?"

[4]. "This doesn't make any sense," mutters your shy teenage nephew almost inaudibly, hiding his face behind his uPad. "Being physically present at your school or workplace is so outdated - and unnecessary, if you ask me - thanks to the latest developments in technology. You should ban the commute, and subsidise remote working. People can just attend classes online or communicate with their colleagues via Trype. This will solve the traffic problem, and also help reduce the social anxiety that some people might feel in face-to-face interactions." [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

[b][anchor=783]#783[/anchor]: Sergeant McCool Reporting For Duty [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Gossip magazines have exploded into a frenzy after news broke that famous teen idol @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ "Squeaky" McCool is being conscripted into @@NAME@@'s military.

The Debate
1. "I heartily welcome this man to the force," dead-eyed military recruiter @@RANDOM_NAME@@ utters in flat monotone. "Sergeant McCool failed to pass his initial examination, and he exited through the wrong door. But these are minor obstacles every soldier can learn to overcome. He will enter training immediately, and I am sure he will be proud to serve in the front lines with the other grunt... fine @@DEMOYNMADJECTIVE@@ men and women." 

2. "NO! He's going to DIE!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a 45-year-old who gives @@HIS@@ current profession as 'Squeaky's Number One Fan'. "@@LEADER@@, you can't let Squeaky get killed. Can't you just, well, refuse him? We Squeakers need him so much. He supports all kind of charities: [i]Dinner-Dance for the Destitute, Masquerade for the Pox-Marked[/i]... Say, if he paid you some of his millions, couldn't that be seen as a surrogate to actual service?" 

3. "This the pretty boy that's due in?" rasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from the shadows, riffling through gossip magazines and military files. "He should already be physically fit at his age. In neighbouring countries, kids of seventeen, fourteen, six, can already disassemble and reassemble a rifle, crawl along the ground on their knees and elbows and take out a sniper... normal stuff." @@HE@@ pauses to show you a video of unknown origin, which appears to depict youngsters playing cops-and-robbers. "Our imitation of conscription has failed to instil healthy @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ values into our people. We must widen the net and make the training harsher." 

4. "When an engineer joins, we put them to work fixing stuff," explains Army logistician, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, moving a battalion of toy soldiers from one side of your desk to another. "Why not use this pop singer's talents? We'd welcome him into the Army, but never put him on the front line. Instead, he'd fly from base to base singing to adoring uniformed fans, pose for recruitment posters, and go on TV to praise the glory of our great nation. He will serve beautifully."

[b][anchor=784]#784[/anchor]: The Driving Force [Petreniax; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
With @@NAME@@ committed to reducing its carbon footprint in accordance with the International Climate Treaty, many are asking if encouraging hybrid engines and electric cars might help.

The Debate
1. Ebon Flask, the oddly-named CEO of Nikola Automobiles, is sitting on the corner of your desk, bursting at the seams with excitement. "Hybrid engines are the future! You'll see lower emissions, and drive the growth of new industries. I'm not saying that we should ban the gas guzzlers, of course, but perhaps we could encourage new ways of thinking?" He leans over slightly. "Like maybe increase road tax on polluting vehicles, then subsidise eco-friendly ones? After all, making these cars is a bit expensive..."

2. "Forget this hybrid stuff; my boys in the lab are working on a full-electric engine," interjects Evan Mask, the strangely similar-looking CEO of Edison Industries. "That would get rid of fossil fuel dependence all together; and with renewable energy generation we're talking unlimited travel with no negative effects. All you need to do is ban petrol stations, and build lots of plug-in charger stations in their place. Oh, and you're going to need lots of wind turbines too. One every hundred yards across the country should do it."

3. Soccer mom Alana Messc offers you her opinion about the situation. "People across the nation have different opinions. So why don't you allow free choice in a free market? Let's have gas, hybrid, [i]and[/i] electric cars. I'm rather partial to my gasoline-powered minivan: it does just fine when I'm taking the boys to practice. But I know my husband wouldn't mind a hybrid, and my oldest is interested in an electric car, so it's a win-win-win. Of course, we could use an income tax break to be able to afford all those vehicles..."

4. "You hear that? Her GASOLINE-POWERED vehicle is doing fine. We don't need these greenies ruining the economy with their snotty ideas anyways," asserts Eton Muscat, lobbyist for @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Petroleum. "Do you know how many jobs there are in auto manufacture and oil refinery processes? Do you know how much harm you'd do if you wreck these industries? Discourage ideas like hybridization and electric cars, for the sake of compassion. Oh, and let's quit that dumb climate treaty while we're at it."

5. "That's the face of corporate evil, right there," whispers radical environmentalist Egon Mist, pointing not just at the oil lobbyist, but at all four of the previous speakers. "@@NAME@@ needs to free itself of this culture of seeing ecology-destroying transportation as a right. Our ancestors got around fine on foot, and never needed to travel more than a hundred miles from the place of their birth. Get rid of them all: cars, trains, buses, planes, and anything with an engine. That's the way back to a greener and better world."

[b][anchor=785]#785[/anchor]: Born To Be My Baby [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
When @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ and her husband couldn't conceive, they employed a surrogate to bear a child for them, using the father's sperm and the surrogate mother's egg. However, after the baby was born, the surrogate mother refused to give up the child and is battling for permanent custody.

The Debate
1. "This kid gets 50% of his genes from me. Surely that counts for something in a court of law?" questions the intended father of the baby, holding his wife's hand. "My wife has ovarian cancer; she can't have children and a surrogate was our only choice. This woman was paid a considerable amount for the job of carrying our baby. Now she says she wants to keep our child? Utter nonsense! As Justin's biological father, I demand that we be given custody!"

2. "There is no way you can take my little Justin from me!" yells @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the surrogate mother, letting the baby dangle on the handcuff strapped around her wrist. "I am his biological mother! Men do not understand the bonding that mothers experience with their children at birth! That guy who claims paternity rights just because he gave me his sperm has no such bond with Justin. They can have the money back, but they can't have MY son!"

3. "As always, science will provide the solution to this dilemma," states John Piaget, a developmental psychologist from the University of @@CAPITAL@@. "Just bring these people to my lab. We'll put the baby in one corner of a room and the mothers in two different corners. Then we'll record the eye movements of the baby - whichever woman he looks at the longest, gets the parental rights to Justin. We could even use this method during bitter custody battles!"

4. "That's a terrible idea. Nobody should put baby in a corner!" grumbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the director of @@CAPITAL@@ Minimum Security Orphanarium, cradling a baby in @@HIS@@ arms, while two other toddlers clutch at @@HIS@@ clothes. "Our institution is overflowing with poor orphans. Wouldn't it be better if you just provided financial incentives, perhaps paid for with a small tax increase, for infertile couples to adopt?" Taking advantage of your momentary absent-mindedness, @@HE@@ puts the baby on your lap. "Speaking of adoption, would you like to take care of this adorable little girl? I think she likes you."

[b][anchor=786]#786[/anchor]: Tainted Tattoos [Nuremgard; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
There has been a rise in infection rates across the country from unsterilized tattoo needles. Health advocates have called on the government to impose safety standards on tattoo parlors across @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "This can't go on!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Health and Safety Board. "The government needs to regulate tattoo artists and ensure that minimal health and safety practices are being followed. Otherwise, we'll have a full-blown crisis on our hands. Did you know that some tattoo artists don't even sterilize their equipment? That's risking all kinds of disease!"

2. "This is ridiculous!" exclaims tattoo artist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ inks one of your staffers with a skull tattoo. "Why punish all of us because a minority don't use clean needles? We need less state interference, not more. Word of mouth, not government regulation, will put the ones who infect their customers out of business. It's common sense!"

*3. "It's about time this country banned body modification altogether!" condemns controversial religious speaker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Tattoos, piercings, and - ugh - fake nails, are all disgusting and offensive against the Creator. Holy books from all religions clearly indicate that this modification is a sin. Put some funding into religion and religious education instead to bring forward these lost souls so we can show them the true path of righteousness." [[color=purple]Must lean towards being religious[/color]]

*4. "The only people who wear tattoos are criminals and gangbangers," reminds police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who heads the Gang Warfare division of the @@CAPITAL@@ police force. "It's about time we banned tattoos and other bodily modifications. They give people this idea that they're 'cool', which leads them towards a path of crime. Banning them will reduce crime, and make it tougher for the gangs to identify each other. That makes my job easier." [[color=purple]Must lean towards being secular[/color]]

[b][anchor=787]#787[/anchor]: Come Fly With Me [Thyerata; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
A recent Air @@NATION@@ flight departing from @@CAPITAL@@ Airport was overbooked, resulting in the violent removal of a passenger. After legal scholars were unable to find any clear consensus about passenger rights within the nation's existing laws, you have been dragged in to make a decision.

The Debate
1. "Now look here," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the injured passenger, speaking to reporters from @@HIS@@ hospital bed. "I paid top @@CURRENCY@@ for that seat, and yet those horrible police officers thought I should be dragged off the plane just because the airline hadn't properly planned for the amount of people who would want to fly that day. It's unfair. I say that if we pay for a ticket, we should be allowed to fly on the airplane. It's that simple."

2. "But we do plan!" sputters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Chief Operations Officer of Air @@NATION@@, as @@HE@@ strides into your office without an appointment and knocks your transportation advisor out of his seat. "Virtually every flight has cancellations and no-shows to balance out the overbooking. We just had an abnormal influx of passengers for that particular flight. Yes, we also needed to put a few of our own employees on the flight, but that's completely irrelevant. I say that we should be allowed to throw passengers off the plane if we have to - and if they won't go willingly, they should have to deal with the consequences."

3. "Why do we even have airplanes in the first place?" asks elderly protestor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a "Just Plane Stupid" banner. "Airplanes are noisy, polluting monstrosities that are prone to frequent maintenance delays and flight cancellations. I say we should get rid of airplanes and invest in public transport... by which I mean domesticating the @@ANIMAL@@ and teaching people to ride them."

[b][anchor=788]#788[/anchor]: Duel Purposes [Singapore no2; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
You are having an early morning discussion with your Finance Minister about Maxtopia's recently enacted sheep tariffs when a sword-wielding maniac jumps into your field of view.

The Debate
*1. "Hello, my name is Count Mount Crystal," monologues the saber-brandishing hooligan, who seems rather familiar for some reason. "I was given a life sentence for false charges of high treason. I lost my wealth, property, and custody of my children while in prison. However, I managed to escape, and I am here to settle a score. Prepare to die!" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

*2. "Hello, my name is Count Mount Crystal," monologues the saber-brandishing hooligan, who seems rather familiar for some reason. "I was exiled for false charges of high treason. I lost my wealth, property, and custody of my children after I was forced to leave @@NAME@@. However, I managed to return, and I am here to settle a score. Prepare to die!" [[color=blue]Must not have prisons[/color]]

3. "Excuse us, 'Count', but we were in the middle of a discussion of national importance!" fumes your Finance Minister, trying to shoo the miscreant away. "This just demonstrates the uncouth nature of conflicts being settled by two people waving big sticks at one another. We should ban dueling of any sort, have disputes once again settled via the legal process, return to our riveting discussion, and avoid entertaining this cretin."

4. "How undignified!" reprimands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an economic advisor, tut-tutting at the entire scene. "Why must we insist on solving disagreements through violence? Instead, how about a nice game of chess? Don't ban dueling altogether, just make it take a more intellectual form."

**5. "All of you are ignoring the big picture!" exclaims Judas Elgar, a legal consultant. "This clearly indicates that our judicial system is in need of a major overhaul. If we allow juries again, judicial oversight would be a thing of the past, and malicious malefactors like him would receive a fair trial and wouldn't be knocking upon your door and threatening you in the hot light of morning." [[color=purple]Must not have juries[/color]]

6. Several security guards burst forcefully into your office, almost destroying your front door in the process, as the 'Count' ducks behind a pillar. "We are deeply sorry for our failure to protect you!" apologizes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Head of Security, grabbing your arm and hastily leading you out of the room. "Clearly, allowing dueling to solve political disputes will quickly deplete us of all our leaders and politicians, including you. You just have to ban people from challenging politicians to duels, and call it a day."

[b][anchor=789]#789[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: @@CAPITAL@@gate [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
In a clandestine operation, your Propaganda Ministry and Intelligence Services have been wiretapping the offices of government critics and the headquarters of the opposition parties. The most prolifically targeted individual is recently elected representative Barry Maxman, a dashingly handsome author and political journalist, who is a determined enemy of your government. Unfortunately, Barry caught on, which gave him fresh ammunition for his latest magazine articles agitating against your leadership. He's dubbed this the [i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i] scandal, and is holding it up as an example of your "many abuses of power." You have convened your advisors in an emergency meeting.

The Debate
1. "This is bad. How in the name of Violet did this happen under your watch?" asks Gordon MacGruber, your Chief of Staff, as he frantically points at an anti-government newspaper with the headline '@@LEADER@@ Must Go!'. "We must categorically remind the people that you were not involved and disavow anyone who has been named in the scandal. We need to cover up this mess as much as we can while we distract people so their minds are focused elsewhere. Stay strong, @@LEADER@@, we've got this covered."

2. "@@LEADER@@, I implore you! If you help me, I'll help you launch the perfect counter-attack!" exclaims Propaganda Ministry aide Virgil van Houten, who was named in the scandal. "Exonerate me and put me in charge of handling the investigation. With more wiretaps and more covert surveillance, we'll be able to find something scandalous on this guy and discredit his claims of corruption. With Maxman facing [i]ad hominem tu quoque[/i] attacks, you'll emerge stronger than ever!"

3. "Instead of working against Mr. Maxman, why not work with him?" suggests Frankie Willis, your Minister of Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows. "Barry is pretty popular, and it wouldn't hurt you to borrow some of his credibility. We... no... YOU need to apologize to him, along with anyone else who was victimized, and work with him to improve your public image. I bet you'll find that you'll survive this scandal much better by playing nice as opposed to acting belligerent. Who knows, he might even have some good ideas on how to actually run this country!"

[b][anchor=790]#790[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: The Art Of The Distraction [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
The @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal has gone viral, and you have decided to distance yourself from the people involved.

The Issue
The @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal continues to be front page news. Facing continued scrutiny and criticism, several of your closest Cabinet ministers and aides have suggested doing something to distract the people from @@CAPITAL@@gate.

The Debate
1. "The people are clearly angry because we haven't gone far enough!" exclaims Gordon MacGruber while continually squeezing a stress ball. "Dismiss anyone involved in the scandal from their posts, and don't stop there. Take a stand by prosecuting the corrupt career politicians and the lobbyists, and ensure that there's always a free press to ask tough questions. Once @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ see how none of this was your fault, they'll surely forgive you! Just make sure you appear sincere in your efforts."

2. "Nothing distracts the people more than a good dosage of fear from an even bigger enemy," reminds your Minister of Defense, while quickly leafing through a book entitled [i]Political Corruption For Dummies[/i]. "You've read my reports of those pesky East Lebatuckese infiltrating Marche Noire, right? What if we started rumors about something similar happening here? We could claim that the East Lebatuckese have agents in @@NAME@@, and we could even come up with some sort of agency to track them down. People will be so scared they'll turn on each other and forget all about us!"

3. "I hate to say 'I told you so,' but I told you so!" rebuffs Propaganda Ministry aide Virgil van Houten, as he emerges from his hiding spot in your coat closet. "To be honest, the only one who truly understands @@NAME@@ is the person who has been running it. We need to start cracking down hard on the media, protesters, and that pesky Barry Maxman just like I said. It's obvious that he's engaged in un-@@DEMONYM@@ activities. You come up with some trumped-up charges and I'll plant the evidence."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b][anchor=791]#791[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: The Smoking Gun? [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
With the @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal heating up, you have authorized increased surveillance against government critic and opposition politician Barry Maxman, in an effort to find something scandalous to discredit him.

The Issue
Intensified snooping into Barry Maxman's personal life has revealed his preferred brand of cereal, what times he goes to the bathroom, how often he walks his poodle named Violet, how much he spends on post-it notes, and whether he wears boxers or briefs. What it hasn't revealed, however, is any salacious material or defamatory evidence, leaving you with the dilemma of how exactly to proceed with the campaign to discredit one of your most vocal critics.

The Debate
1. "Damn this guy is clean! Barry Maxman doesn't even have an overdue library book!" exclaims a rather frustrated Virgil van Houten, who now heads the Propaganda Ministry. "It's obvious what we need to do - make something up! If the people see a strong leader smacking down a pesky troublemaker like Barry Maxman, then surely they'll fall in line! Heck, we could even use this method to target more people we don't like!"

2. "I disagree! The smarter thing to do is consolidate your position," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a young intern with a hint of ambition in @@HIS@@ eye. "Pass laws that give you more power, and fire anyone who makes you look bad, including those who were named in @@CAPITAL@@gate. Let no law or government initiative pass without your approval. After all, only YOU can be trusted to run @@NAME@@ effectively, perhaps with the assistance of some previously unknown young guns. The gullible fools will eat it right up."

3. "Hmm... if Maxman seems too much of a goody-goody to be true, he probably is," muses Director of State Security @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a bug detector wand around your office. "He's almost certainly an East Lebatuckese infiltrator, out to destabilize our fine nation. The reason why there's no evidence is because East Lebatuckese spies are good at covering their tracks. What we need is to set up [i]The Committee On Un@@DEMONYM@@ Activities[/i] to assess the loyalty of everyone in @@NAME@@, including journalists and politicians who are a little too critical or annoying."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b][anchor=792]#792[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: Why Can't We Be Friends? [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
In the wake of the @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal, you shocked @@NAME@@'s political establishment by deciding to work with Barry Maxman.

The Issue
Barry Maxman, despite being targeted by rogue officials in @@NAME@@'s government, has agreed to meet with you personally. After being escorted by his own private security, he has arrived at your office, ready to state his demands for reform.

The Debate
1. "Thank you for agreeing to meet with me," remarks Mr. Maxman, after handing you an autographed copy of his latest book, [i]Johnny's Government[/i]. "Now let's get down to business. What I want, and I suspect many @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ agree, is ridding this government of corruption once and for all. Scumbag corporate lobbyists and dirty politicians infest your government - they must all be arrested! You also need to guarantee freedom of the press, and ensure that the government will never again spy on private citizens in any way, shape or form. Finally, you personally must apologize for letting things get this bad, and agree to full government transparency forevermore."

2. After Mr. Maxman leaves the room, you confer with a few close associates. "If you want to make sure scandals like this don't happen again, you need to consolidate power around yourself," suggests your brother, a personal admirer of Blackacre's Supreme Leader. "Pass a law that requires all laws, directives, and operations to go through you. You'll be seen as a strong leader who keeps an ever-watchful eye over the government. There's no need to give into Maxman's demands. If the Party backbenchers and opposition don't like it, they know where the door is."

3. One of your more sinister advisers approaches you and whispers in your ear. "We have Maxman in our grasp! We need to arrest him now before he goes off the radar. You can even spin it that you tricked the traitor into letting his guard down by inviting him to meet with you. Now that's a win-win solution! Well, not for Maxman, I suppose."

[b][anchor=793]#793[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: Knock Knock. Who's There? Not You Anymore! [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
In a stunning move, you have fired scores of politicians, hundreds of staffers, and dozens of department heads who have had allegations of corruption against them in the wake of the @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal.

The Issue
The halls of government are silent. Not a creature is stirring, not even a lobbyist. It is becoming increasingly difficult to govern @@NAME@@, and the few politicians who remain have gathered to address these concerns.

The Debate
1. "My sources are telling me that it's being reverently called '[i]The Purge[/i],'" declares your personal secretary, who is now doubling as your Finance Minister. "'I think that people have bought the way you handled the @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal and that you had nothing to do with it. This is the perfect time to call for a new election. That should ensure that you'll be elected in a landslide, and not to mention it'll help you find a replacement for me. I'm not cut out for all this financial mumbo jumbo."

2. "Now is not the time for a costly and divisive election," reminds your Minister of Keeping Things Real, one of the few cabinet ministers who still has @@HIS@@ job. "We should bring back some of the people we dismissed. Why not rehire the people who were let go for the most trivial of offenses? We can't run the country like this. We can still pass your reform bill, but right now we need more people, and a proper budget, to make @@NAME@@ run efficiently again."

3. "Have you ever considered that things are just fine the way they are?" suggests the [i]North @@NAME@@ Libertarian Party[/i] Chairperson, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You know, the government was so bloated you probably had no idea where one ministry began and where another ended. No wonder @@CAPITAL@@gate happened right under your nose. Fewer politicians and ministries suckling on the taxpayers' collective teat can only be a good thing. The best government is a small government, and it's much more efficient."

4. "Well you've cleaned house, but there's still one thing you haven't done," observes Barry Maxman, who is currently in the process of writing a tell-all book about his ordeal. "Even if you say you weren't directly involved in these corrupt activities, they still happened under your watch, and under your administration. I suggest that you take responsibility for once in your life, and throw yourself in prison. It's the morally right thing to do. Remind the people that nobody is above the law, not even you."

[b][anchor=794]#794[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: Fear And Loathing In @@CAPITAL@@  [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
You decided to greenlight [i]The Commission On Un-@@DEMONYM@@ Activities[/i], an organisation with the purported goal of rooting out East Lebatuckese spies and agitators within @@NAME@@.

The Issue
There are many lingering questions about the Commission, and it is now looking to you for direction and strong leadership to set its path in the days ahead.

The Debate
1. "Now is the perfect time to strike against anyone who might oppose you!" giggles Virgil van Houten, throwing a knife at a poster of Barry Maxman. "The polls are in, and the people are behind you. We all agree that something needs to be done about the 'East Lebatuck problem.' Let's round up anyone who is on the government's 'Enemy List' and execute the lot of them for treason. Kill them all! Barry Maxman, we're COMING FOR YOU! HAHAHA!" He picks up your butter knife and makes several stabbing motions.

2. "Executing Maxman and his followers will only make us look guilty," reminds your rather shocked policy adviser. "If we start executing anyone who criticizes the government, there'd be nobody left. It would be easier to encourage citizens to snitch on each other, and gather all the rumors, accusations, and smears into a secret database. With that 'evidence,' we can subtly blackmail and bully anyone who opposes us into silence."

3. "I couldn't care less about this [i]Committee On Un-@@DEMONYM@@[/i] whatever," yawns your tired and lazy brother, who always looks for the easy way out. "There's always a simple solution to these problems. What if we release a list of suspected spies, and then announce that patriotic citizens won't be prosecuted for taking national security into their own hands? Say, with a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire, in a dark alley. That should take care of the Maxman problem before we visit mother next weekend..."

4. "There probably are REAL East Lebatuckese spies lurking in @@NAME@@, hidden deep undercover," replies secret agent James Bont, back from a successful mission that thwarted a cat-loving supervillain's plot for world domination. "I seriously doubt this Maxman is one of them. What you should be doing is investing in the spy agencies and police, so we have the proper funding and equipment to catch these guys. Background checks on all citizens would be a good place to start. Sure, it doesn't really solve the scandal, but the people's minds will be more focused on whether their neighbor is a spy, not some scandal that's yesterday's news."

The Story So Far
Barry Maxman has been arrested on charges of terrorism and treason.

The Issue
Now that Barry Maxman is languishing in a prison cell, it's up to you to decide what to do with him. However, there are many in your government who have their own ideas...

The Debate
1. "Barry Maxman is a terrorist and a traitor to our glorious @@TYPE@@!" declares @@RANDOM_NAMEMALE@@, your Interior Minister, wearing no shirt and a black hood over his head. "We will show @@NAME@@ and @@REGION@@ that we do not tolerate these ingrates in our nation. We must burn his books and execute him in @@CAPITAL@@ Square for all to see! That'll send a message to any of Maxman's sympathizers! I'll execute the bugger myself, if you'll just say the word."

2. "Killing Maxman is all well and good, but having him rot in prison would send a far more powerful message to anyone who has the audacity to challenge you," points out Virgil van Houten, who is arguably one of the most powerful people in @@NAME@@ right now. "The image of a broken-down Maxman in an orange jumpsuit would be a constant reminder to anyone else who might get some crazy ideas. There's nothing like fear to keep the people in check!"

3. "There is always room for compassion," advises your mother during her monthly visit. "Executing Mr. Maxman sends a terrible message and makes us no better than the tinpot dictatorships that we're supposed to be condemning. Pardon him and give a good speech about how compassionate you are. You gave him and other dissidents a good scare. He'll surely toe the government line now."

4. "If the people want a face-off with you and Maxman, let's give them one!" gleefully suggests Lucy Commodus, your assistant who happens to be an avid historical reenactor. "Why not a televised sword-fight to the death with you and Maxman at @@CAPITAL@@ Square? We'll dull his blade and slip some sedatives into his water to make sure you win. Not only will this take care of the Maxman problem, but you'll look like a badass at the same time."

[b][anchor=796]#796[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: It's Dangerous To Go Alone! [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
To prevent another scandal from happening under your watch, you consolidated power around yourself, making sure nothing happens in the government without your knowledge.

The Issue
Your newfound authoritarian streak has your influence increasingly growing in @@NAME@@. You now have a unique opportunity to solidify your power base and take control of the nation. Your innermost circle has conferred to advise you on the best path to take...

The Debate
1. "It's dangerous to go alone. Take this!" enthuses your Chief of Staff, thrusting a pen into your hand. "Here's a new piece of legislation that will outlaw all elections in @@NAME@@ and keep you in power for the rest of your long and prosperous life. Everything would be so much easier without pesky things like debates, checks and balances, and voting getting in the way. This is for the prosperity and security of our great @@TYPE@@!"

2. "You're nuts! That's a sure way to get you assassinated," scoffs your chief strategist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, known for infamously punching a journalist who asked too many questions. "The real problem in this country is the fake news media. After all, they're the ones who caused this fake scandal to get as big as it did. Let's dismantle it and set up our own state-controlled news. Imagine how much easier things will be when WE control the message!"

3. "As Mockiavelli said, it's best to rule by fear," loosely quotes Virgil van Houten, who many regard as the true power in @@NAME@@. "Eliminate the people's so-called right to privacy so we always know what they're saying and doing. We could even set up anonymous tip lines for people to report their family and neighbors for suspicious activity! We can identify problematic people, then swoop right in and take care of them before they get out of hand. This is for national security!"

4. "All of you are nuts!" exclaims opposition politician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as your bodyguards struggle to hold @@HIM@@ back at your doorway. "It's good that you're taking steps to improve the government's reputation after @@CAPITAL@@gate, but becoming an authoritarian despot is hardly the way to do it! If you want a true test of how the people feel about you, call a General Election, and prove you have a democratic mandate! That will win more hearts and minds than tyranny ever will."

[b][anchor=797]#797[/anchor]: [color=red][i]@@CAPITAL@@gate[/i][/color]: Yesterday's News [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Story So Far
It has been some time since the @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal, and many are reflecting on what the scandal's place in @@DEMONYM@@ history should be.

The Issue
The @@CAPITAL@@ District Schoolboard has decided to update their @@DEMONYM@@ History course to include recent events, including the @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal. The scandal is still fresh in people's memory, and those who were involved in the scandal have their own ideas on how it should be taught in schools.

The Debate
*1. "The lesson from history is absolute power corrupts absolutely, and government cannot be trusted," points out Barry Maxman, whose new novel chronicling @@CAPITAL@@gate recently topped the best seller list. "@@CAPITAL@@gate was about unchecked corruption, censorship, and your gross incompetence. We must remember @@CAPITAL@@gate, to make sure that no other person is intimidated the way I was. That should be its legacy." [[color=blue]Must not kill dissidents[/color]]

*2. "The lesson from history is dissidents must die, for the sake of the nation," points out your Interior Minister, wearing a t-shirt depicting Barry Maxman's grave and the caption 'We Got Him.' "@@CAPITAL@@gate was about a hack author and a traitor to this great country who was planning attacks against us. He made up the idea of this so-called scandal to try and turn the people against you. We must never allow people like Barry Maxman to have that kind of sway in @@NAME@@ again. Dissent will never be tolerated. That should be its legacy." [[color=red]Must kill dissidents[/color]]

3. "The lesson from history is that traitors and terrorists are always hiding among us," exclaims Virgil van Houten, who is widely expected to replace you one day. "[i]The Commission On Un-@@DEMONYM@@ Activities[/i] continues to hunt down the enemies within as we speak. It shows just how much the people are willing to sacrifice for the good of the nation. @@CAPITAL@@gate proved that when there's a threat to @@NAME@@, the people will always unite and rise up against it, even if that threat is a fellow citizen." 

**4. "The lesson from history is the free press safeguards democracy," reminds media baron @@RANDOM_NAME@@, handing out free newspapers to everyone in the room. "If it weren't for the media, we might never have found out about the government's shady dealings. @@CAPITAL@@gate reminds us that the free press must be protected at all costs, otherwise a dictatorship just might be around the corner." [[color=blue]Must have Free Press[/color]]

**5. "The lesson from history is that only the government can be trusted to tell the truth," reminds @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your new Propaganda Minister, after burning the last remaining non-state newspaper in @@NAME@@. "The so-called @@CAPITAL@@gate scandal was nothing more than a fabrication of the press. They created this fake scandal because of their personal vendetta against you. That is why we had to step in. Now the people know that they're getting the truth from our state media. After all, allowing all those opposing ideas would be absolute chaos." [[color=red]Must not have Free Press [/color] / [color=red]Must have State Press[/color]]

***6. "The lesson from history is that democracy is the best form of government, for all others have been tried," states your sister, who now works as a democracy advocate throughout @@REGION@@. "This was a healthy reminder that we need to be a nation that freely elects its leaders, and we won't allow some dictator to walk all over us. You chose the noble path, dear @@LEADER@@, and we'll continue to make sure that @@NAME@@ is respected throughout the land!" [[color=blue]Must have Elections[/color]]

***7. "The lesson from history is that an iron fist will always achieve better results than so-called democracy," states your brother, who enjoys his new extravagant lifestyle. "This was a healthy reminder that @@NAME@@ needs a powerful leader to run it, regardless of what anyone says! You took the opportunity to seize power and crush the opposition. All praise our glorious Leader! Hail @@LEADER@@!" [[color=red]Must not have Elections[/color]]

8. "The real question is why is this being taught in schools at all?" queries an eager young intern, who literally worships the ground you walk on. "Yeah, @@CAPITAL@@gate isn't exactly a bright spot in @@NAME@@'s history, but you know some of these teachers will use it as propaganda against you. It's best if we all simply forgot about it, and ban any teachings or depictions of the scandal from here on out."

[b][anchor=798]#798[/anchor]: A Periodic Issue of Elementary Nature[Island of Stability; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
Your Science Minister has convinced you to go to a party being thrown by @@NAME@@'s leading scientists to celebrate the successful synthesises of a new element at @@CAPITAL@@ University. The element itself decays within microseconds, but that hasn't stopped the party from dragging on for hours. Your attention has finally been sparked as a massive debate over the name of the element has broken out. The situation threatens to become as unstable as the element itself, and people are looking to you for a solution.

The Debate
1. "I believe the answer to this issue is as simple as polynomial quadratic expressions to those possessing acceptable levels of neural tissue," yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the leader of the research team responsible for the discovery, while attempting to disrupt the gaggle of boffins around @@HIM@@ by swinging @@HIS@@ phone wildly and playing lightsaber noises. "It should be named after me. I discovered it after all. That makes it the optimal method to utilise when naming newly created elements."

2. "I disagree with that hypothesis," begins @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the Advanced Superheavy Synthesis and Electrochemistry Society in a calm monotone whilst sipping from a glass of dihydrogen monoxide. "The correct name for this element would be Unseptnineteenbillionium in accordance with the regulations of my organisation. Any other name would only inhibit clarity to chemists across the world." Whilst saying this, @@HE@@ unravels a periodic table and writes a five-letter symbol in the position of the new element.

3. "I have an even better idea," claims your cousin, using a megaphone to be heard over the sodium-level volatile debate now occurring at the party. "Why not name it after you? This element could make us well known as the scientific leaders of the world! Besides, who else is more worthy of such an honour? In fact, why not extend it a bit further and name every element after glorious leaders of our nation?"

4. "Woah, woah, woah!" gasps an increasingly incredulous undergrad, who happens to be passing by a window on the way to the library. "How the heck are we supposed to remember anything about it from names like that? We should name the elements after what they actually do! Like this new one can be called 'Lastslessthanamillisecondium'. That'll make it way easier for us all to make any sense of this stuff."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b][anchor=799]#799[/anchor]: A Political Cock-Up [Iraines; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
A low budget film allegedly showing junior government minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in a compromising (though technically legal) position has gone viral on social media. Concerned individuals, especially parents, are loudly voicing their opinions on the matter.

The Debate
1. "Touching that and then shaking hands with you?" gasps local parent and averred shoplifter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while discreetly watching the infamous video on @@HIS@@ phone. "We can't have people like that on television addressing the public, or anywhere else in government for that matter! Besides, you deserve better than to have your good office be sullied by such an immoral individual!"

2. "Booting them out of their job won't do any good for our country. If anything, they'll just go down as a martyr to their fellow deviants!" rants affluential religious talk-show host @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I've subjected myself to constant, repeated study of the sinful actions of this filthy reprobate, and as far as I'm concerned the only way to teach degenerates like this a lesson is through proper punishment. A thrashing maybe, or a good old-fashioned stoning in the town square!"

3. "Don't you think this is taking things a bit far?" queries the minister in question, nervously. "It's a low-quality video and that could be anyone's... Okay, it was me. But I don't do it anymo— Okay, I still do it, but it's biology that made me this way! Can you blame biology? @@LEADER@@, you can't deny that I satisfy you with the job I do, so why should it matter how I spend my leisure time?"
