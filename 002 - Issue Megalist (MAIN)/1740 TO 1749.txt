[b][anchor=1740]#1740[/anchor]: Cut the Cheese [Bisofeyr; ed: Bisofeyr][/b]

The Issue
A recent national health study revealed that @@NAME@@'s cheese-based diet has caused an increase in cardiovascular diseases and chronic flatulence, leading to grating demands from dairy commentators.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, this is a cream-filled catastrophe!" moans your personal doctor, Noelle Marcelline, as she yanks a block of cheese out of your assistant's hands. "Our people are literally dying for a little cheddar! We must institute a strict cheese consumption limit of one cup per day and end our reputation for heartburn and methane output!"

2. "Oh, you're making me bleu!" complains acclaimed abomination cheesemonger Joseph Softing as he takes a large bite of Gruyere. "Cheese is an important part of our economy, and maybe there's some health risks, but removing it would be a brie-saster! We're here for a gouda time, not a long time! I say we lean into it and make cheese-themed amusement parks, carnival games, restaurants, and more! This will bring a Sirene-essaince of cheese-related festivities!"

*3. "I thinks we just needs to balance the national diet," notes temperamental chef, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Cheese, it's great and all, but so is cabbage, and fish, and steak! If we up investment into producing other high-quality foods, people will grows to love the umami of mushrooms, the tang of pickles, and the [i]fishiness of fish[/i]! Diversification is da key, here, we just needs to show peoples there's a whole world of flavor out there." [does not have Vegetarianism]

*4. "I thinks we just needs to balance the national diet," notes temperamental chef, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Cheese, it's great and all, but so is cabbage, and fish, and steak! If we bring backs the meats, and work to produce other high-quality foods, people will grows to love the umami of mushrooms, the tang of pickles, and the [i]fishiness of fish[/i]! Diversification is da key, here, we just needs to show peoples there's a whole world of flavor out there." [has Vegetarianism]

5. "I smell an opportunity for militarization!" squeals @@RANDOM_NAME@@, newly-hired intern to your third most prominent general. "My mama always tells me how my gas could kill a man, and now I'm thinking she might have a point! Yes, our people are gassy, but if we ask people to bottle their vapors up, we'll both stop the spread of stench and use it as a biological weapon against our enemies! Two cheeses, one wheel."
