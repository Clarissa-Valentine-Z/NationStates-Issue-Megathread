[b][anchor=1460]#1460[/anchor]: A Burning Question [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Burpbarry, a well-known @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ luxury outerwear brand, has declared that they have incinerated 15 million bits worth of stockpiled surplus clothing.

The Debate
1. "I can't believe these people set fire to a heap of perfectly serviceable clothing, while I don't even have a plain shirt to wear," wails @@RANDOMNAME@@, the beggar who often hangs out in front of your residence, clasping the newspaper around @@HIS/HER@@ shoulders more firmly. "This is such an atrocious waste of resources. Manufacturers should be made to donate their surplus goods to charity for unfortunate folks like me, not destroy them!"

2. "Hogwash! You won't listen to this deranged woman, will you?" asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, the CEO of Burpbarry, looking flabbergasted. "Don't forget that we are a luxury brand, and exclusivity is maintained by controlling the supply side of the equation. What distinction would wearing a Burpbarry outfit confer on you, if any old scrounger could get the same things from a donation bin? Market freedom means being allowed to protect our brand value, and to dispose of our own property as we see fit."

3. "Frankly, your disposal method is disgusting!" fumes @@RANDOMNAME@@, an environmentalist and DIY enthusiast, sporting a hat made of a recycled yogurt tub. "If companies want to get rid of their surplus without diluting their brand, why not upcycle inventively? For a start, I think those fancy Burpbarry scarves could be braided into a reusable canvas bag. Perchance you should seize the end-of-season surplus, and employ skilled weavers to turn them into something new."

The Issue
In a recent local election, homeless person @@RANDOMNAME_1@@ was denied the right to vote because @@HE/SHE@@ did not have any identification. @@HIS/HER_1@@ plea to vote went viral after a crowd of journalists, who were coincidentally at the polling place to report on a story about a prominent politician allegedly kissing babies, recorded the rant.

The Debate
1. "All I wanted to do was vote," sobs @@RANDOMNAME_1@@, in hysterics as the media scrum surges forward, hanging on to every word @@HE/SHE_1@@ says. "How does it feel to disenfranchise the poor, @@LEADER@@? You know we don't have the time or money to get an ID while we're trying to stay off the streets. Let us vote, no questions asked!"

2. "What a waste of time," says political pundit @@RANDOMNAME@@, rolling @@HIS/HER@@ eyes while she speaks over an unflattering still of @@RANDOMNAME_1@@ showing @@HIM/HER_1@@ ejecting spittle midspeech. "Politically engaged voters will gladly make an effort to present identification when voting. It's a small price to pay to protect ourselves from the wrong people being elected! In fact, if we wanted elections to be more secure, election officials should check IDs more carefully in those crime-infested areas."

4. "I'm astounded that this is still an issue," says @@RANDOMNAME@@, clutching a scrapbook filled with photos of you. "You're the best option we've got, never mind the voters! Abolish all elections, and give yourself the perpetual right to the highest office - a dictatorship is all we deserve."

The Issue
@@REGION@@ gave cheer last night after infamous terrorist leader @@RANDOMNAME@@ was assassinated in a surprise raid by the elite @@ANIMAL@@ Team 5. However, jubilation quickly turned to controversy when one of the soldiers claimed personal responsibility for the assassination, forgoing the unit's traditional "code of silence".

The Debate
1. "What can I say? It's just the doggone plain truth!" bellows Sergeant @@RANDOMNAME_1@@, the offending soldier in question, as @@HE/SHE_1@@ props @@HIS/HER_1@@ boots on your desk. "You can see it all on the body cam footage, so it's not like anyone can say I'm lyin'. Already got some United Federation suits looking to make a movie, some dork wants to write my biography, the VIP party invites are rolling in â€” I earned all of this. Y'all can't take that away cause some limp-wrists say it's 'disrespectful' or 'attention hogging'. Besides, it's good for @@NAME@@ too! Once my story becomes a blockbuster, nobody's going to question our military might. So how about you just give me a medal for a job well done?"

2. "Etiquette exists for a reason, @@LEADER@@," retorts General @@RANDOMNAME@@ as @@HE/SHE@@ readjusts your lapel pin. "Even though Sergeant @@RANDOMLASTNAME_1@@ took the final shot, that mission was a team effort. When you start snubbing that core belief, you end up making soldiers of fortune, not members of the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ armed forces. Oh sure, it's all fun and parties today. But then they start disobeying orders, thinking they know best. Then they start going rogue. Next thing you know, Blackacre slips some @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ under the table, and our whole army is goose-stepping down @@CAPITAL@@ to a different tune! We should discharge @@RANDOMLASTNAME_1@@ for unmilitary-like conduct and stand firm behind our behavior policies."

3. "Ah, nuts to that, General Buzzkill!" proclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, another @@ANIMAL@@ Team 5 operative whose tinted glasses and long hair certainly violate some dress code. "@@RANDOMLASTNAME_1@@ has it right! Your problem is trying to make the army all secretive and mysterious. It's just another job, dude! No one tells my old man how to sell stuffed animals at the mall. He just, like, does it. We need to be more like that. Dump all of these creepy creeds and regulations! Let troops say what we want to say, to whoever we want. Everything will work itself out."
