[b][anchor=1720]#1720[/anchor]: Let Freedom Ring [The Free Joy State; ed: Ostrovskiy][/b]

The Issue
Following Twitcher's recent mass deletion of accounts which posted threatening messages and misleading information, inventor @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ has invented the 'Patriot Phone'.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, my name is @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, and for the longest time, I couldn't help but feel that Big Tech has it out for me." says @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, showing a phone that looks very similar to an old model Pear Phone. "Just because someone is using their platform, they think that they get to dictate how people behave. Well, say hello to the Patriot Phone. It makes the user completely untrackable and unblockable by Big Tech conglomerates like Twitcher, MyFace and Mamie Sue's Cupcakes, and proudly hosts all the apps that Big Tech have censored: ConspiracyTube, Political Punch-Up, Really Real Totally True Bonafide News, and more. It's amaSIM! Give the Patriot Phone your seal of approval and show you value the privacy of citizens, as well as their right to express themselves however they see fit. What do you say: are you in with the PATRIOT PHONE?!"

2. "If you go to your neighbour's house, do you expect to stay after you call your neighbour a 'babbling, brainless bucked-tooth baboon'?" demands Twitcher's representative @@RANDOM_NAME@@, glaring at @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, who nods. "Tech companies invite people into their space; they must be allowed to throw people who abuse that hospitality out. Trolls and flamers have hidden behind the invulnerability of perceived anonymity for too long and that darn phone would make it worse. Please, mandate that all social media accounts must be linked with a verified offline person."

3. "You do realise what @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@ has?" whispers your brother, bundling the inventor out of the room. "There are who-knows-how-many people, who feel completely anonymous, sharing their most intimate and unguarded thoughts. Who knows what we could discover: adultery, plots to overthrow the government, criminal confessions. Your eyes could be literally everywhere, knowing every thought. You could prevent criticism spreading by arresting someone upon the first doubt they express. Just tell that stupid inventor that the government wants to back his phone, plant backdoors in them, issue them cheaply and then sit back and watch the information roll in."

[b][anchor=1721]#1721[/anchor]: Ministers of Make Believe [Nergtul; ed: Nardin][/b]

The Issue
The new web game [i]CountryProvinces[/i], a nation-building simulator which has players govern fictional states and answer their pressing dilemmas, has surged in popularity in @@NAME@@, captivating everyone from schoolchildren to senior bureaucrats. Now, a growing crowd of amateur armchair governors and aspiring civil servants have flooded your office with "urgent suggestions" on how to improve the real government, proudly citing the success of their digital states as proof of expertise.

The Debate
1. "Listen @@LEADER@@, I'm the successful leader of three republics and one @@CLASSIFICATION@@, and they're all far better than @@NAME@@!" proclaims popular WhoTuber Mr. @@ANIMAL@@ as he video calls you while live-streaming to a massive audience. "Me and my millions of subscribers have spent countless hours playing [i]CountryProvinces[/i]. We basically know the workings of government administration inside out, so why not just give anyone who's played the game positions in yours? Chief Admin would do nicely for me."

2. "Nerds ruin everything," gripes your Minister of Skepticism @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ shuts down your computer. "Running a government isn't as simple as clicking a few buttons and drafting infobooks. We fill out reams of paperwork, meet with innumerable diplomats, and sometimes redirect... er... correctly allocate government funds. This simulator is clearly spreading misinformation about how our government operates, which will lead to future generations of incompetent citizens! You must demand that [i]CountryProvinces[/i] and all media depicting the government must accurately portray how our country is run in detail."

3. "[i]CountryProvinces[/i] is actually amazing!" your fresh out of college nephew @@RANDOM_MALE_FIRST_NAME@@ says while enthusiastically reorganizing parliamentary seats in @@REGION@@land. "I've used the game to help me teach my new classroom that passing bills is as fun as skateboarding down the streets of @@CAPITAL@@. You should incorporate [i]CountryProvinces[/i] into the nation's education system to drive home to 0's future bureaucrats how cool government administration can be, which I'm sure they'll love learning from their equally cool teachers."

*4. "Why isn't our real government as easy to run as [i]CountryProvinces[/i]?" muses the game's creator @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ drafts up [i]CountryProvinces 2: Bills and Ballots[/i]. "It can take weeks or months to pass a single law that doesn't even effect the average Joe. In my game, it takes just the click of a mouse. I can simply install the [i]CountryProvinces[/i] source code onto your computer, letting you make new laws and run the nation from the comfort of your home. Imagine the efficiency when you'll be calling all the shots!" [TBD]

[b][anchor=1722]#1722[/anchor]: Seeing With the Heart [The Ankhalic Vaspriot; ed: The Ankhalic Vaspriot][/b]

The Issue 
Career interest surveys carried out in schools show the nation's youth are more apathetic about entering the workforce than ever before, with many responses expressing feelings of purposelessness and pessimism about success prospects. Your Minister of Education has decided to take you on a tour of @@CAPITAL@@ to find a source of inspiration for the youngins.

The Debate
1. As soon as you've left your office, your brother jogs up behind you. "Clearly we should be encouraging children to run for office when they're old enough. Who doesn't love sneaking their agenda into policy? It's the perfect occupation for dissatisfied youth!" Your Minister of Education hurries you out the door before he can continue.

2. While walking down the sidewalks of @@CAPITAL@@, a young @@MAN@@ waving a phone jumps in front of you. "Oh my Violet, it's @@LEADER@@! Hi, I'm @@RANDOM_NAME@@. You've probably heard of me; I'm kind of a big deal on TickTack. What children lack is belief in their self-worth! Tell them to get out there and declare themselves the greatest — to demand that the world clap for them and make themselves known and admired! Who needs a career when you have an army of fans?"

3. Your Minister of Education pulls you into an alleyway to get away, when suddenly, an extremely inebriated @@MAN@@ hobbles towards you. "Eugh, that's alllll drivel... There's nothing these children can expect in this world but, uh, taxes, and, uh, probably more taxes. Just throw some cash over to the booze industry, and then they could drink until they've gotta drink to forget the shame of drinking like I do."

4. After making yet another escape, you find yourself in the heart of @@CAPITAL@@'s economic planning district. Your Minister of Education runs up to one of the innumerable suits to ask for their thoughts. "I have been interrupted exactly 4 times in my career and this is one of them!" The economist exclaims, furiously tapping on a calculator. "Every moment is an opportunity to make money so you can buy things that help you make more money to buy more things, repeat [i]ad nauseum[/i]! You've wasted enough of my time, streamline getting children into the planning world by subsidizing internships so they don't waste any more of theirs. The sooner the love of money is hammered into them, the better."

5. "Oh, don't listen to them." remarks a lamplighter working above you. "It's that exact attitude of making work your entire existence that makes children so unhappy. I love this job, but now I'm being expected to do the work that three people would've done when I started. Once work's finished, my day's up in a matter of minutes! I can hardly sleep with it all! You've got to make it actually feasible to survive off of a single job and normal hours. People will enjoy what they do more when it doesn't consume them."

6. Wanting a change of scenery, your Minister of Education ushers you onto the campus of the University of @@CAPITAL@@, where you encounter one of the nation's most prominent scientists frantically scribbling observations from an experiment. "Let's not preoccupy the youth with such ephemeral things," they begin. "Instead, instill the love of science into them so that they may deepen our understanding of the universe. Why bother with fleeting things like love and living? We have papers to write!"

7. "I'm sorry today didn't go as planned," sighs your Minister of Education, doodling a picture of an elephant inside a boa constrictor. "You know, perhaps all this finding something [i]for[/i] the kids is taking the wrong approach. Remember when we got stranded on that island with the young prince of Moltevino? I was sure we were going to die, but all he seemed to care about was getting home to water his potted plant. Maybe we shouldn't rush kids into the workforce so much and make it possible for them to live off of their hobbies and actual interests. I suppose all us big people sort of forgot what it's like to be a child somewhere along the way. The sun will be setting soon. Care to come watch it with me?"

[b][anchor=1723]#1723[/anchor]: Have You Ever Seen the Rain? [Thorn1000; ed: Westinor & The Ankhalic Vaspriot][/b]

The Issue 
A long-awaited storm system that forecasters said would break @@NAME@@'s drought did not hold water, with clouds seemingly set to rain over @@NAME@@ pouring down over Althaniq instead. Current intelligence suggests that Althaniq utilized cloud seeding, in which particulate matter is introduced to the atmosphere to induce early condensation.

The Debate
1. "The forecast said this was supposed to be the big downpour that saved our season!" exclaims @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Farmers' Interest Group representative @@RANDOM_NAME@@, adjusting @@HIS@@ ill-fitting suit. "Why can't we get our own 'make it rain' program to assist farmers in times of drought? We can't let Althaniq be the only nation with this technology. If we don't do something, the droughts will only get worse! We can't weather this storm, or lack thereof, alone. Farmers need your support, @@LEADER@@."

2. "While there isn't much evidence that cloud seeding is viable, we can [i]never[/i] be too careful," admonishes your Minister of Meteorology, having finally stopped rambling to your aide why the shape of the clouds out your window forecast certain disaster. "If we are wrong about the efficacy of their methods, there could be dark skies ahead. Unfortunately, our intel is rather cloudy at the moment, so we need to send some spies into Althaniq pronto to sabotage this surreptitious so-called cloud seeding, lest we be left permanently in the rain shadow of their stolen thunder."

3. "Oh, get your heads out of the clouds! The next form of warfare will be fought in the stratosphere, @@LEADER@@," barks Minister of Defense @@RANDOM_NAME@@, rummaging through your things for listening devices. "What if our enemies get their hands on this technology? Did you hear that ten thousand lightning bolts hit Brancaland overnight? That's no coincidence! We need to be able to manipulate the weather first before they start controlling it here. Get top minds and more dollars on this, stat! If we can give them a real bolt from the blue, they'll be under the weather in no time!"

[4]. "As with all things, Violet has the answer," intones @@RANDOM_NAME@@, holding an ornate rainstick. "More prayers to benevolent Violet will make Her open the heavens once more. This nation has fallen down a dark path of sin and the only way out is to return to Her magnanimous Holy Light! Althaniq has begun nationwide prayers to Violet to punish the wicked sinners within @@CAPITAL@@ and beyond. We must ensure that She favors us or our gray skies will never clear up, er, return."

[b][anchor=1724]#1724[/anchor]: Urban Explorers Cross the Line [Voltavia; ed: Raionitu][/b]

The Issue
A group of four teenagers were traversing an abandoned mall on the outside of @@CAPITAL@@ when one of them tripped and was impaled by a sharp piece of scrap metal, leaving @@HIM_1@@ in critical condition. @@HIS_1@@ parents are now exploring ways to get reparations from the owners of the facility.

The Debate
1. "My @@SON_1@@ is in the hospital and won't be able to participate in the bog snorkeling championships this weekend, all because of those people's negligence! Look what they leave just lying on the ground where anyone can step on it!" cries the @@BOY_1@@'s father as he slams down samples of sharp and rusty pieces of metal collected from the old mall. "I demand that the owners of that old mall  tear down that safety hazard of a building!"

2. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a lawyer representing the mall, shrugs @@HIS@@ shoulders apathetically. "Those kids were trespassing. Obviously the mall isn't being used anymore, but we still own it. They knew it wasn't safe, and had to get past several locked doors and trespassing signs to get inside. It's @@HIS_1@@ own fault @@HE_1@@ got hurt, not ours. @@HE_1@@ should pay for @@HIS_1@@ mistakes, and the broken window @@HE_1@@ used to get in."

3. "Going into a rundown mall was stupid, but that's what we urban explorers live off of!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, the injured @@BOY_1@@ in question, rolling into your office in a wheelchair. "Don't tear down any old buildings or anything like that. After I'm healed, I can work until the medical bill is paid. It was my fault, and I'll fix it. And don't punish urban explorers for the damage other people did to buildings; that's the work of vandals not us. Urbex is better than sitting around letting our brains rot playing video games or something. The government should protect abandoned buildings and keep them empty for kids like us."

The Issue
@@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, formerly the dastardliest criminal on the loose in @@NAME@@, was finally arrested last night while attempting to abscond with a wheelbarrow full of garden gnomes. Due to the high-profile nature of @@HIS_1@@ myriad cases, intelligence officers from all the agencies of the alphabet have ambushed you with some unconventional proposals. 

The Debate
1. "@@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@ could be an invaluable asset with @@HIS_1@@ connections and skills," boasts @@NAME_INITIALS@@BI agent @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@. "Even though @@HE_1@@ has a criminal record longer than the @@CAPITAL@@ River, @@HE_1@@'s willing to co-operate with us to infiltrate some of the nation's most infamous crime syndicates. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity! You must allow this @@MAN_1@@ to work with us and be planted in criminal organisations at once so we can start taking them down from the inside. Don't worry, we'll be sure to keep a close eye on @@HIM_1@@. All we're going to need is a little bit of funding to get the latest microchip trackers. What could go wrong?"

*2. "What could go wrong?!" scoffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from the @@NAME_INITIALS@@SA, pacing around the room rapidly. "Don't let @@HIM_2@@ plant the seeds of doubt in your mind. Do you not understand the litany of crimes this @@MAN_1@@ has committed? We're talking murder, practising medicine without a license, taking candy from babies, and, worst of all, tax evasion! Yeah, no wonder @@HE_1@@'s willing to co-operate.

4. Before you can address the crumpled body on the floor, a figure in a black trenchcoat steps out from the shadows. "Why stop at just one infiltrator? We could carefully select the most cunning criminals from the prison system to help uproot @@NAME@@'s crime syndicates in exchange for a well-deserved pardon. We could establish a whole network of assets — under my leadership, naturally, and create a safer @@NAME@@ for all. If law enforcement can't do the job, my criminal informant army will." Before you can catch their name, they return to the shadows again.

[b][anchor=1726]#1726[/anchor]: Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Protests About the Maxkini [The Anti-Social Socialists; ed: Zwangzug, Bisofeyr][/b]

The Issue
@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ beaches have experienced a schism as the maxkini — voluminous swimwear favored by the Cult of Cyan for its provision of increased modesty — has exploded in popularity. During a press conference intended to introduce your Minister of Sand Castle Defense, incessant reporters continue to ask for a formal position on the garment.

The Debate
1. "We must ban the freedom-hating maxkini!" spouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hiding @@HIS@@ face behind the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ flag. "Don't get me wrong here, I don't mind them ladies runnin' about on the beach, but what with them goshdarn maxkinis covering people's faces, ya can't tell who's who! Mate, it's gotten so bad, even the bloody media knows what's goin' on! Who cares about some Cyan believers when your safety's at stake?"

2. "Can't a woman change in peace?" gripes @@RANDOMNAMRANDOM_NAMEE@@, emerging from a nearby locker room. "It's hard enough for girls these days to have the confidence to go to the beach wearing whatever we choose without everybody judging us. I mean, I could barely stand to come out of the stall because of this maxkini row! Wouldn't it be better for everybody if you punish the woman-shaming creeps who instigated this incident?"

3. "Don't let the fearmongering get to you; maxkinis are the next big thing," insists designer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sporting next summer's violet model. "Trust me, I know a trend when I see one. Do you know how many smart women wear these to protect themselves from skin cancer? Not to mention the Cult of Pizza fundamentalists who cover up so they don't get extra-crispy. In fact, you might want to subsidize this innovation in sun-safe beachwear. That way, @@NAME@@ will be buoyed by the waves of the future!"

4. "We can argue about this until we're blue in the face," cries loud, proud, and notoriously flamboyant provocateur @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ struts past the crowd wearing nothing but body paint. "Maxkini this! Bikini that! If you want this ruckus to end, Leader, just ban clothing on our pristine beaches! What could be more natural? Think of all the beautiful, suntanned skin!"

[b][anchor=1727]#1727[/anchor]: Wrath of the Lichen [SinCorp; ed: Klaus Devestatorie]

The Issue
Logging company @@ANIMAL@@Corp, preparing to harvest a forest stand it planted three decades ago, has been thrown into controversy after environmental scientists discovered a unique and undocumented species of glow-in-the-dark lichen growing on the trees just days before cutting was set to begin.

The Debate
1. "This isn't just moss, it's a miracle!" gasps Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@ a lichenologist clutching a bark sample like a newborn. "We've found a lichen species that doesn't exist anywhere else in @@REGION@@ — possibly even brand new to science! And it's bioluminescent! If you let those chainsaws roll, we'll lose an entire ecosystem before we've even catalogued it. We need to stop the harvest, preserve the site, and fund a full ecological survey of this stand and others across @@NAME@@. We owe it to science... and the planet!"

2. "Oh for the love of Violet, it's just mold!" growls @@ANIMAL@@Corp COO @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dumping a chainsaw on your desk. "We planted these trees on our own land so we could actually use the timber, not host some freeloading fungus! Our company and employees bleed money every day we sit on our hands. You gotta tell those moss munchers to beat it! This harvest needs to go ahead on schedule — lickin' or no lickin'."

3. "Maybe we can find a middle path," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Agriculture. "We could set aside a small research parcel for the scientists and let logging continue elsewhere on the site. That way we support both the environment and the economy. Get the scientists to figure out how to transplant the lichen to other forests, and then @@ANIMAL@@Corp can finish their harvest. Sure, the company won't be happy and the scientists probably won't be happy either, but that's how you know it's working."

4. "You're all missing the real opportunity here," whispers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your unnervingly excited Tourism Minister. "This radiant algae has an amazing transcendental aura. Let's turn the entire forest into a living, breathing eco-mystical theme park, open the gates to everyone, and make a hundred times more @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ than the lumber was ever worth as furniture or paper. Tree spirits! Guided pilgrimages! Devotional merchandise! The believers will flock to it!"

[b][anchor=1728]#1728[/anchor]: Overcensortivity [Crisis; ed: Raionitu][/b]

The Issue
After the particularly gruesome death of a factory worker was recounted in vivid detail on the front page of The @@CAPITAL@@ Leader, questions have arisen around whether or not censorship is really all that bad.

The Debate
*1. "How can you just let them portray this visceral filth, @@LEADER@@?" asks flabbergasted @@FATHER_1@@, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, shielding @@HIS_1@@ two young toddler's eyes. "We can at least try to be more sensitive with our... over-descriptive articles. Else all of the children will be exposed to violence, destroying their precious innocence! Bar newspapers from describing gore, death, and disturbing crimes. And make them put age ratings on the front page while you're at it!" [[color=red]Must not have Vat-produced infants[/color]]

*2. "How can you just let them portray this visceral filth, @@LEADER@@?" asks a flabbergasted @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, head of the Society for Moral Decency and Softer Pillows.

Bar newspapers from describing gore, death, and disturbing crimes." [[color=blue]Must have Vat-produced infants[/color]]

3. The particularly jaded @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@ interjects with @@HIS_2@@ side of the argument. "We can't just censor what the weak-willed can't handle! O great @@LEADER@@, don't listen to these snowflakes! It's essential to provide the whole truth of the nation's happenings! How else would one form an opinion on the event? Sure, it may seem a bit sickening at first to hear about how @@HE_3@@ had @@HIS_3@@ arm torn off, and then when the industrial saw-" As @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_2@@ continues @@HIS_2@@ colorful description, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ starts turning an odd color of green. @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@ waves exasperatedly at @@HIM_1@@ while looking at you imploringly.

4. Slamming @@HIS@@ fist on the table, @@RANDOM_NAME@@ loudly interrupts with @@HIS@@ idea, "Remove newspapers!" Following this, there are several seconds of awkward silence, waiting for @@HIM@@ to continue. After that are several more seconds of stunned seconds followed by realization that @@HE@@ is not going to continue, and is, in fact, proposing to remove newspapers. Somebody coughs. Feeling rather awkward, your secretary decides to end the meeting early.

[b][anchor=1729]#1729[/anchor]: Retired Rebels Request Restitution [The 19th Century; ed: Jiangbei][/b]

The Issue
The use of scorched earth tactics during the @@NAME@@ Civil War did millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in damage, devastating territories that had been under rebel control. A delegation of former rebel leaders is invading your office to demand the government pay civilians for everything your troops 'liberated' from existence.

The Debate
1. "Our supporters are homeless, our harvests are ruined, and our towns are ash," laments former rebel general Bob Lee, tugging at a soot-stained sleeve. "People are suffering and we need help to rebuild our motherland. Set up a war claims commission and start writing checks for the homes, shops, and fields that your boys 'accidentally' tillered with artillery."

2. "You took up arms first, you lost, and now you want a payout? Absolutely not," snorts loyalist general Phyllis Sheridan, flipping open a glossy catalog to a page labeled 'as-is armored personnel carrier.' "If anything, we should sue rebel leaders for property damages, since they first started this civil war. We'll seize their assets and auction off the lot to make our citizens whole."

3. "These charred ruins are an excellent carbon sink", declares your Minister of Creative Finance @@RANDOM_NAME@@, upending a mason jar of soot onto your blotter. "The biochar we created will help lock away emissions for decades. We just need to certify the scorched areas as char zones, issue some carbon offsets, then sell them to allies desperate to meet their climate pledges. That won't help the rebels, but at least it will help us fund their displac- er, resettlement in @@CAPITAL@@, where we can keep a closer eye on them."
