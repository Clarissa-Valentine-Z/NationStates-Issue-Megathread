[b][anchor=1540]#1540[/anchor]: Clean Flavours [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Frieden-und Freudenland and Candensia][/b]

The Issue
Over the weekend, two dozen people were admitted to the hospital after ingesting the new liquid detergent Wonderoso, having mistaken it for a soft drink.

The Debate
1. "It's irresponsible to package detergent in the same way as soft drinks," observes Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a toxicologist. "It's not just the liquids either. There's brightly coloured detergent tablets that kids mistake for sweets, and manufacturers apply scents like cinnamon, mint and vanilla to toxic products. Cleaning products should be hard to open, look unappetising and be clearly noxious in appearance!" @@HE@@ pauses to take a swig from @@HIS@@ soft drink, and suddenly stiffens and keels over like a falling log.

2. "Our prime responsibility is to our shareholders, and that means maximising sales with consumer-preferred features and packaging," explains a corporate marketing spokesperson, who is dressed in a lab coat to give the impression of being a scientist. "It's not our duty nor the government's duty to protect people from their own stupidity, like somehow mistaking licorice-flavoured brown oxy-power fizzy Wonderoso for Eckie-Ecola. Our all-purpose cleansers are not intended for ingestion despite — allegedly — tasting twice as good as the leading alternative."

3. "The problem is not that detergents look like foods, it's that food looks like detergents," complains organic farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a misshapen turnip at you. "We should ban food colourings and any food additives that are designed to change the appearance of edibles. Once people get used to natural-looking produce, there'll be no chance of them mistaking a pastel-coloured soap product for food."

[b][anchor=1541]#1541[/anchor]: Confusion of the Highest Order [The Dark Crusaders; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
Attending a passing out ceremony this morning, a stand-off ensues when two officers of different ranks in the nation's sprawling military bureaucracy both insist the other salutes first. Twenty minutes of awkward posturing later, an aide suggests it might be time you intervened.

The Debate
1. "This is absolutely ridiculous!" exclaims Field Commander Four-and-a-Half Star Lieutenant-Colonel with fig leaf cluster Boyson Longfellow, arms held stiffly at his side as he stares down Grand Marshal Brigadier-Major first class Grace Shatner. "We officers should be afforded the respect our proud service warrants, through a plethora of ranks to tailor to every officer's skill set and service to the army, and it's every soldier's duty to understand their place in the hierarchy."

2. "Why should I be forced to remember every single rank?" pipes up pallid-faced orderly Luciano Beachcroft. "I got ten days of latrine scrubbing for not being able to distinguish between 162 varieties of epaulettes — how ridiculous is that? Military ranks must be made simpler if you want efficient battlefield decisions rather than generals squabbling like children." He looks mournfully at a worn toothbrush as both the Field Commander and Grand Marshal turn to glower at him.

[b][anchor=1542]#1542[/anchor]: Dangerous Liaisons [Baggieland; ed: Frieden-und Freudenland][/b]

The Issue
Your brother just broke up with his most recent girlfriend. However, this one turned out to be a bit different from all his previous love interests.

The Debate
*1. "You've got to help me; she's a psycho! Did you know she tried to put my beloved bunny Fluffykins in a pot and boil her alive?" exclaims your brother, as he nervously pulls the curtain to check if she's lurking outside. "I tried to break up with her nicely, as I always do, but she won't take 'no' for an answer. Look at this — 426 unread messages already today — and it's only 2pm! You've got to make stalking a serious offence punishable by jail time and send this clingy hysterical woman to prison! Then, I'll be free to ask out that cashier at the local supermarket; she's a real cutie!" [Validity TBD]

*2. "You've got to help me; she's a psycho! Did you know she tried to put my beloved bunny Fluffykins in a pot and boil her alive?" exclaims your brother, as he nervously pulls the curtain to check if she's lurking outside. "I tried to break up with her nicely, as I always do, but she won't take 'no' for an answer. Look at this — 426 unread messages already today — and it's only 2pm! You've got to make stalking a serious offence punishable by jail time and send this clingy hysterical woman to prison! Then, I'll be free to ask out that cashier at the local supermarket; she's a real cutie!" [Validity TBD]

3. "Although I agree with your brother's diagnoses, I disagree with his method of rehabilitation," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a psychiatrist, as @@HE@@ beckons your brother to a leather couch. "Serial stalkers are known to have mental disorders that increase their infatuation with the object of their desire, leading to irrational and anti-social behaviour. Prison time will not cure them. What they need is an extensive course of cognitive behavioural therapy, where they will learn to decode, process, and alter their warped thinking patterns."

4. "But he promised to be with me forever! I don't want anyone else — he's the one for me," wails your brother's ex, appearing from behind the couch and giving him a vacant stare. Then she turns to you and smiles sweetly. "You should make it law that anyone who has been ditched has the right to watch over their ex constantly for the next six months. Just to make sure they're okay and that they're sure they made the right decision." She turns again to your brother. "By the way, I know you're seeing that girl at the supermarket. STAY AWAY FROM HER OR I'LL BE USING HER INTESTINES AS FISH BAIT!"

[b][anchor=1543]#1543[/anchor]: What Are We Paying For? [Verdant Haven; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
As your Chief of Staff wraps up the latest whiz-bang press conference about a new government initiative, you're pretty sure you hear crickets in the room. That is, you probably would hear them, if not for the loud chorus of "Awwwwww" emanating from the state-controlled press pool, where most of the reporters are distracted by something on a monitor and are paying no attention whatsoever to the presentation.

The Debate
1. "Oi, losers! Pay attention!" snaps your murine-looking Chief of Staff, furiously launching an untouched stack of glossy full-color handouts into the distracted crowd. "You think we pay you to ignore what we have to say? And why is that live feed showing a rerun of last year's duckling parade instead of me? We've never forced your hand before, but this is too much... no more Mister Nice Government! From now on I want to see our message front and center on every platform! News scripts should be submitted for approval with no fluff pieces or unrelated content distracting from government messaging, and by thunder I never want to see the words 'rat-like' in the same sentence as my name ever again!"

2. "Huh, what? Oh, you're done?" mumbles Divit Dunn, political correspondent for the @@NAME_INITIALS@@BC, as he brushes aside an offending press packet. Seeming to notice your presence for the first time, he straightens up and continues, "@@LEADER@@, you've always respected the speech rights of your state media, and we've loyally kept the people happy by giving them what they want. The people just don't care about this... uhh... what was it again? Anyway, the point is that we have the nation's best interests at heart, and sometimes that means ducklings. If you share our love for @@NAME@@, you should increase funding for all of your media assets and issue new charters guaranteeing that we have editorial independence. Leave media decisions to your media experts!"

*3. "The people love you, true, and maybe that is even partly due to the media," agrees @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your eternally pragmatic Chancellor of the Exchequer. "Do you know what would make the people love you even more though? Tax breaks. Why should we pay for a bunch of pompous journalists to go around saying whatever they want if the public will ignore our content either way? Cut the media loose and let them compete on the free market like everybody else. We'll save enough to give the citizens a tax cut, and we can pad our general fund at the same time. Everybody wins!" [[color=blue]Must be Capitalist[/color]]

*4. "The people love you, true, and maybe that is even partly due to the media," agrees Judi Little, your eternally pragmatic Chairwoman of the State Committee on Expenditures. "Do you know what would make the people love you even more though? Tax breaks. Why should the state pay for a bunch of pompous journalists to go around saying whatever they want instead of what the people need? Cut the media loose, along with any other industry that doesn't want to toe the line, and let them experience how harsh a free market really is. We'll save enough to give the citizens a tax cut, and we can pad our general fund at the same time. Everybody wins!" [[color=blue]Must be Socialist[/color]]

The Issue
Concentrated grape juice bricks are being sold with the helpful warning: "Do not place this brick in a sterilized one gallon crock, add sugar, water, and yeast, and let stand covered in a warm location for seven days prior to bottling, or else an illegal alcoholic beverage will result."

The Debate
1. "They're makin' a mockery of ush, a mock-a-reee!" slurs your brother, taking a swig from a nondescript brown glass bottle. "Thes...sh... thesesh companiesh need to reshpect your autho...aurhoritah! Shilly word games changes...esh nothing! Punish them! Punn... issh... ish..." He falls asleep with an accusatory index finger still pointed in the air.

2. "We are absolutely devoted to sobriety!" protests the CEO of Temperance Grapes, the manufacturer of the offending product. "We are merely offering advice to help maintain legal compliance. Tell your regulators to stick to enforcing the letter of the law, instead of inventing problems where none exist! Which reminds me, we need to add a warning to the packs of baker's yeast we sell as well..."

[b][anchor=1545]#1545[/anchor]: Deep Down Up to No Good [Baggieland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Many years ago during a skirmish between Dàguó and the United Federation, the [i]UFS Fricking Awesome[/i] was sunk off the coast of @@NAME@@ with many lives lost. A United Federation businessman recently dived on the site to place a wreath, but discovered that the ship was completely gone, a casualty of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ metal salvagers.

The Debate
1. "That was a war grave!" declares Randy Cox III, the UF businessman, as his scuba gear drips water all over your office. "A local fisherman told me that the bones of the sailors who died on that ship were just dumped on a landfill. This is outright sacrilege! Not only must these piratical bottom-feeders be arrested, but @@NAME@@ must do all it can to protect other war graves in its waters; you need around the clock patrols by the coastguard and warships, whatever it takes!"

2. "That ship belonged in a museum!" shouts fedora-wearing archaeologist Illinois Smith. "Those wrecks need to be excavated by qualified archaeologists, and everything there brought onshore and preserved in the National Maritime Museum. Only responsible professionals like me can be trusted to take due care with these precious historical artifacts!" He twitches slightly, hoping no-one will mention the time he swapped an ancient imperial corpse for a diamond, or used an arm bone as a torch, or endangered an 11-year-old he had employed as an impromptu local guide.

3. "Let's not get in the way of business, shall we?" pontificates Achenar Ponta, the owner of a maritime metal salvaging company. "These ships contain tons of low-background steel, and salvage operations provide jobs and considerable economic and scientific benefit. The [i]legal principle[/i] of [i]'inventores possessores, amittentes lamentantes'[/i] clearly applies here. As for any organic impurities entangled in the salvage, they most certainly do not end up in landfill: they're hygienically cremated during the scrap melting process. I say that any ship sunk in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ waters is @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ property, and so long as we pay our corporation taxes you should be encouraging our entrepreneurship."

[4]. "I say there aren't enough shipwrecks in our waters," ponders Debra Wickwire, the owner of another salvaging company, as she takes a swig from your coffee before you have a chance to grab the cup. "Maybe the government could look the other way while we place a sea mine or two on the busier coastal trade routes. Companies like mine can then just lurk nearby, and we can clean up!" [[color=red]Must have Autarky?[/color] OR [color=purple]Must ban WMDs?[/color] TBD.]

[b][anchor=1546]#1546[/anchor]: Fool's Gold [Electrum; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
When @@NAME@@ instituted the gold standard, it brought transparency and stability to the sometimes-fickle economy. The economy responded strongly — so strongly, in fact, that the government is finding it difficult to maintain sufficient gold reserves to finance its growing obligations, should they suddenly be called in.

The Debate
1. "If we need more gold, then let's go digging!" hollers Minister for Creative Solutions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, excitedly hefting a pickaxe. "There are viable gold deposits right under @@CAPITAL@@ and some other big population centers. If we loosen restrictions surrounding the use of sodium cyanide, and allow some of the other practices needed for extracting gold from low-grade ore, we'll be able to boost our reserves in a jiffy! Now that's an Au-some idea."

2. "There's no need to do all that work... the real problem is private ownership of gold!" argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Minister for 'Creative' Solutions. "If our people are holding on to gold, then we can't use it to back our currency. We need to abolish private ownership of gold, and compel people to turn it in for its fair market value! Of course, there is the teeny-tiny complication of people hiding their holdings from the government, so we'll also need to establish a new investigatory agency to look into potential cases of hoarding."

*3. "We have an open economy — if we need more gold, we can trade for it!" observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your creative Minister for Solutions, known for @@HIS@@ connections to war zones across @@REGION@@. "Thing is, you don't just want to buy it using @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ — that'd be trading gold for gold. You need somebody willing to make a different sort of exchange. As it happens, I know some bloodthirsty rebels... err, I mean plucky freedom fighters, who would happily exchange some of their vast gold reserves for material support in the form of bombs and ammunition. Say the word and we'll turn lead into gold!" [[color=purple]Must not have Autarky[/color]]

*4. "The challenge is that we have a closed economy" observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your creative Minister for Solutions, known for @@HIS@@ connections to war zones across @@REGION@@. "Our ability to finance our obligations will always be limited by our domestic stock of gold. If we open our borders to trade, I bet I can find somebody willing to send us gold for something we don't need as much. As a matter of fact, I know some bloodthirsty rebels... err, I mean plucky freedom fighters, who would happily exchange some of their vast gold reserves for material support in the form of bombs and ammunition. Just say the word and we'll turn lead into gold!" [[color=purple]Must have Autarky[/color]]

5. "This policy experiment has been madness! Why are you trying to save it?" pleads Ruel Taylor, an overwrought employee of the Central Bank of @@NAME@@ taking a break from haranguing passers-by about something called 'Floating Rates.' "There is no way we can mine, seize, or import gold fast enough to meet the demands of our swelling economy. End the gold standard and allow our currency to fluctuate again on the open market, or we'll suffer an economic catastrophe that makes our current limitations look like a holiday!"

6. "This policy experiment has been madness! Why are you trying to save it?" pleads Ruel Taylor, an overwrought employee of the Central Bank of @@NAME@@, taking a break from haranguing passers-by about something called 'Currency Convertibility.' "There is no way we can mine, seize, or even import gold fast enough to meet the demands of our swelling economy. End the gold standard and return to issuing fiat currency, or we'll suffer an economic catastrophe that makes our current limitations look like a holiday!"

[b][anchor=1547]#1547[/anchor]: The Return of the Prodigal Son [Baggieland; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
Some time ago, the government began abandoning children to raise themselves in the wild. Now, many of these feral children have come of age and are ready to rejoin society.

The Debate
1. "See what a success this policy has been!" boasts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Education, who has had very little to do these past few years. "We've saved so much money on schools, child services, hospital admissions... The state of nature is much more efficient than our government. On top of that, the wolves — or bears, or whoever — raised these children well with a sound grasp of family responsibility and societal togetherness. To take the next step, let's put these free-range @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ into the menial jobs no one else wants. @@ANIMAL@@ see, @@ANIMAL@@ do!"

2. "MY BABIES!" wails @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a mother who had to give up her children to the wild. "My home has been so empty these past years; I just want my little cherubs back... NOW! I don't care what physical or emotional state they're in, or whether they've brushed their teeth in living memory. A mother's love is all they need to once again become valued, cherished members of society."

3. "You can't just reintroduce these creatures into society without any checks," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Social Services, keeping @@HIS@@ distance from a formerly wild child who has also been brought into your office. "There should be at least a year's reintegration period at an educational institution, where these people can catch up on their language skills, as well as learn about human societal norms. They need to be supervised very carefully and have support staff available for them at every stage of their journey, for their own safety as well as ours."

4. "Grrrrrr," snarls the young @@MAN/WOMAN@@ in your office. "Me like forest. No like city. Me back to forest. Stay there. Forever." @@HE/SHE@@ bounds out of your office on all fours, swinging from the chandelier as @@HE/SHE@@ goes.

[b][anchor=1548]#1548[/anchor]: Killing in the Name of Beer [RedBrickLand; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
Ever since the establishment of prohibition in @@NAME@@, organized gangs have attempted to smuggle alcohol into the nation. The resulting conflicts between gangs and police have grown in size and frequency, until a recent incident sparked a full-scale battle which claimed the lives of multiple innocent civilians.

The Debate
1. "Won't somebody please think of the civilians?" wails perpetual gadfly Helen Hatesad, wringing her hands in despair. "Prohibition has turned @@NAME@@ into a dangerous nation full of police violence and trigger-happy gangsters, unsafe even for its own citizens. The only way to stop the violence is to repeal prohibition! Innocent lives are at stake here, @@LEADER@@! If somebody wants to drink themselves into a stupor, then at least they're only harming themselves."

2. "What about their family members?" snaps @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Ness, your Supervisor of Blocking Ethanol Revenue, as @@HE@@ slams @@HIS@@ fists on your desk. "Without prohibition, my screw-up son-in-law will be drinking booze all day, and when he gets drunk... I can't let that happen! Prohibition ain't the problem, it's the lack of funding to enforce it. If we allow booze, @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ will be even more at risk from alcoholism, liver disease, and drunken violence! You should give us more equipment and resources, so we can stop these smuggler gangs and respond to their violence at the same time. Things might get a little spicy at first, but if those gangsters think they can outgun the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ government, they've got another thing coming!"

3. "Don't raise the temperature — promote temperance! If we want to stop the gang violence, we have to remove the reasons people join gangs," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a local teacher, from the head of a children's tour group that has somehow made its way into your office. "Gangs are so powerful because they can recruit young, vulnerable, and disaffected teenagers, leading them into lives of violence and dipsomania. To stop gangs from taking advantage of the youth, we need more progressive social policies in education and welfare, to show kids there's another way. We should also run a public awareness campaign to educate young people about the dangers of public enemy number one: Mr. Alcohol. If we re-educate the people they recruit, the gangs will simply fade away!"

4. "You know, what if all this violence ain't so bad, eh?" interrupts a trenchcoat-wearing man outside your window, who you recognize as infamous mob boss Morbidly Obese Tony. "It keeps the do-gooders distracted, and I'm sure some people could even profit from this funny little situation. Say, why don't you 'inspect' the funds going to the police force? I mean, who's to say that they didn't kill those civilians themselves? And you know, since I'm such a charitable guy, I'll be sure to make a 'donation' to your party once you're done with all of this. You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours, capisce?"

The Issue
The clock chimes as you finally get home. Eleven bells. Is it really almost midnight? Your head is swimming from a day filled with inane meetings about park benches, how big supersize meals should be, and whether or not nuclear annihilation would really be a bad thing in the age of global warming (you figured it'd probably be fine, on balance). As you settle at your desk to finish a couple pieces of correspondence, you realise you've been doing this thankless job for twenty years now. Twenty years! A cause for celebration indeed, so maybe you can spare a couple of minutes to take a break. Thus the masochist within you has decided that, to celebrate this anniversary, "unwinding" on NationStates before bed would be "fun". There's so many things to do, though, and so little time — so what do you focus on?

The Debate
1. Ah, the General Assembly. The perfect place to go if you really want to waste time debating whether or not "shall" or "will" in a piece of legislation results in banning opposite-sex marriages, or potentially criminalising making your favourite horse a member of parliament. The friendly regulars, the welcoming Old Guard; they don't exist in the General Assembly. It's a free for all. It's sink or swim, baby. Publish or perish. Only lawyers need apply. Or something to that effect. If you want to exert control over what is and isn't legal in other nations, though, and mould a multiverse in the image of your own ideals, the General Assembly is exactly where you want to spend your time.

2. Then again, your trigger finger is itching to do some damage in International Incidents. First, you need to find a willing enemy. Then, you can demarcate the boundaries of bloodshed so no uninvited armies can interfere. And finally, you can test out those weapons of mass destruction that you've been eyeing in the shopfronts — only with your enemy's permission, of course. @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ aren't monsters.

3. Thinking on it, though, who needs permission? There's a whole world of regions out there, ripe for the taking. Even working alone, there's plenty to be accomplished, if you're content to play the long game. A word in the right ear here, a polite request for an endorsement there, it's all too easy playing a role — they'll never suspect who you were until it is far too late. Now which region was it you've always wanted to take down?

4. Of course, if a thrill is what you're after then there's bound to be a Sports tournament you can sign up for. Unfortunately, that's no guarantee of success; @@NAME@@'s athletes are at the mercy of fate! Maybe you should call upon the priestess Margaret to sacrifice 1093 rubber chickens to the random number deities on your behalf. But you'd better move fast, because it's almost cut off time!

5. That said, something inside has been gnawing at you. It has been a while. You look at the top of the page and see that you have five issues to address. The reason you first joined NationStates was to continue making decisions outside of work, even if those decisions had no real-world consequences. Except for those meaningless little golden badges on your page. Deep down in your heart of hearts, you know it's time to answer issues on all of your puppets. After all, you're just a primate who can't help but to push buttons for a dopamine release.

6. You then remember that the United Federation Intelligence Agency recently published the latest version of its World Factbook, a widely used resource amongst foreign diplomats for information about the world's nations. Much of the information it contained about @@NAME@@ was just plain wrong, and your own diplomats found themselves fielding dozens of calls asking if it was true that you had been replaced as leader by a @@ANIMAL@@. How much easier it is to set the record straight when you write your own factbooks! The stats are all wrong anyway — your words will tell the real story. If only somebody would read them.

7. Going to your Nation Page, you spot the little card icon staring back at you. Clicking it, you realise you have twenty-two copies of your own trading card. Perhaps this is a good time to add some variety to your collection — there are plenty of ongoing auctions, ready for you to swoop in at the last moment. All it takes is a nation, or fifty, to start sending you some gifts to sell. If you become wealthy enough, you can disguise your narcissism as altruism and stage a giveaway, or hoard a card that nobody will care about until you inflate its price to a ridiculous valuation. With every new pack comes the possibility of a legendary find...

8. The real treasure, however, is the hidden content. Do people even know about the NationStates Against Humanity minigame? Or the Challenge System? You should load up the secret URL and just wait an hour, or three, to see if anyone starts a game. Who cares if no-one turns up? You'll get that great feeling of knowing that you're part of a special elite, a secret Illuminati privy to mysteries that the hoi polloi know nothing of.

9. Out of nowhere, you're struck with the sort of idea that normally only occurs to one of your loopy cousins after a indulging in a mix of self-prescribed herbal remedies: what if you just bought the whole website? That Max Barry fellow certainly couldn't object to a new swimming pool filled with cash, courtesy of your National Treasury. With NationStates under your personal control, the site could finally have unending nuclear war! Zombie apocalypses that permanently affect your population! An IPO that actually earns you money! Maybe the admins could even bring back NationDates...

10. Seriously though, it'd be a terrible shame to waste all that money on a game where other people have the audacity to think their opinions matter — why, you've got literally all the answers to pressing real-life conundrums right here, inside of you! Indeed, people in general really should listen more to you. Wait, what is this? People in General arguing about left and right wing extremism? Gun control? Opinions on capitalism and cancel culture? Oh, abortion! [i]*knuckles crack*[/i] Yes, the world needs to hear from you on this.

11. Alas, the tyranny of choice is just exhausting. You had a long day, and you've spent so much time trying to decide what part of NationStates to play, it's almost time for bed. So how about you roll up your sleeves, pour a drink, and then just chill in one of the spam game threads for five or ten minutes? Whether it's pretending to be a brony, or calling the AN a talentless troubadour, sometimes reverting to childhood silliness is the best way to spend one's time.

[b][anchor=1550]#1550[/anchor]: A Friend With Weed Is a Friend Indeed? [Westinor; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
Recent reports have revealed that drug cartels are supplying the poorer citizens in @@NAME@@ with food and medical supplies, currying favor among the masses and in turn making it much harder for the police to apprehend drug kingpins. Several encounters between locals and law enforcement officials have escalated into full-on riots, with large crowds throwing rocks at police who were attempting to arrest suspected cartel members.

The Debate
1. "The downtrodden, the oppressed, the destitute: these are our people," claims militant weed distributor Ivana Smoke, who is rumored to run half of the black market operations in @@NAME@@. "We provide them with essentials that the government neglects, and in turn they shield us from unjust prosecution. This war on drugs is getting you nowhere — your own citizens aren't even on your side! Cease this mindless vendetta, and tell your pigs to stay out of my territory. Not only will innocent people stop getting hurt, but you can give everyone a tax cut since you won't need as many police. Don't you want to support the disenfranchised and the poor, @@LEADER@@?"

2."Hey! Quick, grab 'er!" orders Police Chief Amber Kidman as several security guards attempt to tackle the kingpin, who disappears in a cloud of strange-smelling smoke. "Gah, we'll get them soon enough. @@LEADER@@, we can't let our glorious @@TYPE@@ be tainted by these ghastly substances. The best method of alleviating poverty is to crack down on all of the drug-pushing criminals that are trapping our people in a cycle of addiction. Give us more funding, more individual autonomy, and allow us to arrest any civilian seen in league with these dastardly thugs! That'll show those high-in-the-sky idiots who's boss."

3. "Brutality won't solve the problem; it'll just cause our streets to be awash with blood!" insists social worker Edward Rivera, who is often seen in @CAPITAL@@'s dingiest soup kitchens. "If you want to prevent people from aiding or joining the drug cartels, we need to improve the schools and social services in these marginalized areas, and open some food banks and medical clinics. By giving our less affluent citizens a path out of poverty, they won't need to rely on criminals for support, and the problem should dissipate... after several years of hard work, of course."

4. "Theesh people are doing ourrr own work for us!" exclaims your brother in extremely slurred speech as he takes a hit out of an impossibly large bong. "Let themm *hic* keep feeding them or whatever, and..." He doubles over and coughs several times. "We can focush on other stuff like *hic* tourism, or something. Isn't thish a great opportunity to promote our sight-seeing industryyy? I'm sure people would looove to feed the pheasants. Or something. Haha!" He then vomits on some important papers you were holding and passes out on the floor.

"Do you know how long it took me to do my hair that day? I mean sure, starving children in Kawandaland, children's hospitals in @@CAPITAL@@, and all that jazz... they're all terribly worthy causes. Why don't we commit to increasing foreign aid, income support and health spending? That'll reduce the need for charities, and will make us look good too." [color=purple]Must not have physical currency[/color]

3. "What, @@HE_1@@ couldn't spare a half-@@CURRENCY@@, so now the taxpayer has to foot the bill?" mocks your Treasury Minister. "@@LEADER@@, it'd be politically wise to fire this skinflint from your cabinet, and to publicly condemn @@HIS_1@@ lack of compassion, maybe while you're looking sad and tearful serving the homeless in the soup kitchen or something. It'd be a cheap way to make you look great, all while distancing yourself from political amateurs who make silly mistakes."

4. "Actually, I find those charity chumps pretty annoying too," chimes in your brother. "The other day I was being cornered by this spotty boy who kept going on about landmine victims, and he didn't go away till I wrote him a cheque. I can't wait till he reads what I wrote on it — suffice to say it contained canine speculations about his maternal lineage. You should make it illegal for these panhandlers to approach and harass people. If I want to donate, I'll walk over to donate. Otherwise, charity beggars should stand quietly and stay out of my way!"

[b][anchor=1552]#1552[/anchor]: An Issue About Nothing [Nardin; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
A raucous crowd draws your attention during your visit to the newest wing of the @@CAPITAL@@ Art Museum. The nation's artists and critics have gathered around controversial experimental artist Salvatore Niente's newest piece 'The Indefiniteness of Memory', an 'invisible' clock statue. They are all eager to give their impromptu opinions to you rather than to the nation's poorly circulated art periodicals.

The Debate
1. "Absolutely ludicrous, just look at it!" scoffs sculptor @@RANDOMNAME@@, throwing @@HIS@@ beret on the ground and stomping on it for good measure. "Oh wait, you can't, because it's literally nothing! Even the most gullible of the hoi polloi can tell you this is not art. True art should convey emotion, express creativity and help others see the beauty of the world! Concept art such as this has no place in these hallowed halls of the masters."

2. "How can anyone seek to establish arbitrary rules for creating art, or enforce styles of a bygone age?" inquires Salvatore Niente, protectively clutching the statue close to his body before being asked by the museum guards to step away from the exhibit. "My sculpture is made of air and spirit, requiring the viewer to use their full power of imagination to grasp. I make no apologies to philistines who don't know how to imagine. Really, you should be helping museums invest in thought-provoking and expensive art that appeals to the modern psyche, such as blank canvases, fruit taped to walls and even someone performing a guttural scream into a microphone."

3. "Who, like, even wants to go to an old boring building for art anyway? You have to walk around and look at what some stuck-up rich dudes thought looked cool hundreds of years ago," says your nephew, a 'crypto bro' hustling for some dough. "It'd be pog if you made a VR museum that showcases a curated collection of digital art. It's a good investment too, with fully guaranteed returns on the blockchain. I know you're old and out of touch, so let me know if you need help with what's dope and what's not."

[b][anchor=1553]#1553[/anchor]: Fifteen Minutes of Flame [Savantoj; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
A massive fire recently struck the vaults of famed @@DENONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ movie studio @@NAME_INITIALS@@GM, tearing through the complex in less than 15 minutes. Questionable storage practices and a lack of fire suppression systems led to the only known copies of many early @@DENONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ films being destroyed in the blaze.

The Debate
1. "This clearly shows that big companies can't be trusted with preserving our culture!" opines self-identified movie critic @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Dogme, best known for espousing the opinion that post-processing should be banned. "Those ignorant cretins couldn't give two @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ about 'An Investigation in Indigo,' or any other film that isn't raking in cash. In my unerring opinion, we need a national film archive with proper storage conditions and protection, overseen by people who truly appreciate the artform, such as yours truly. Then maybe we'd gain some artistic integrity as a nation, and maybe my family would finally stop bugging me about this whole job nonsense."

*2. "This wouldn't have happened if those movies were digitized!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a digital media activist who only goes to theaters for the overpriced snacks. "Well, the fire probably still would've happened, but at least no one would actually care about it! Film reels naturally deteriorate over time; if the fire didn't destroy them, age and neglect still would. We're progressing into a new era, and the way we preserve media should reflect this! Finance the digitization of our cultural film legacy, and mandate that all movie studios save their works in a digital vault of sorts, hosted on redundant servers and accessible to all. Sure, they'll cry about piracy, but @@NAME@@'s amazing culture should be shared with the world." [[color=blue]Must not ban computers[/color] OR [color=blue]Must not ban internet[/color]]

[4]. "Ugh, why does anyone even care about this?" asks soda-sipping teenager @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Most of those movies were probably trash anyway. Why else would nobody have made copies? Just tell the studios to put anything they're not using up for auction. If people want to protect those glorified slideshows, they can do it themselves. It would be a win for everyone involved, and then maybe I can go a day without hearing old people whine about their taxes for once." [[color=blue]Must have private industry; TBC[/color]]

[5]. "Ugh, why does anyone even care about this?" asks soda-sipping teenager @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Most of those movies were probably trash anyway... I've never even heard of them!

You just can't expect my generation to care about some glorified slideshow — technology and taste have advanced too much!" [[color=red]Must ban sequels[/color]]

[b][anchor=1554]#1554[/anchor]: Trajectory x Velocity = GOOOOOOOOOAAAALL! [Baggieland; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
According to breaking news reports, an avalanche the width of three football fields just swept through a mountain community in western @@NAME@@, leaving a runout zone the size of 50 football fields. Survivors are being evacuated to shelters at a nearby football field.

The Debate
1. "Ugh! Why is everything measured in football fields these days?" bemoans your niece, throwing down her maths homework in despair. "Look at this stupid maths question I've got to answer: 'If a train is travelling at 40m/s, then applies the brakes at 1.1m/s2, how many football fields will it take to stop?' I've never watched a game of football in my life... this has no meaning to me whatsoever! You've got to mandate that teachers, newscasters, and scientists stop using these so-called 'visual comparisons' and stick to standard mathematical measurements. Maybe then I'd be able to pass my exams." [does not use metric system]

2. Ugh! Why is everything measured in football fields these days?" bemoans your niece, throwing down her maths homework in despair. "Look at this stupid maths question I've got to answer: 'If a train is travelling at 40m/s, then applies the brakes at 1.1m/s[sup]2[/sup], how many football fields will it take to stop?' I've never watched a game of football in my life... this has no meaning to me whatsoever! Don't we require the metric system to be used in this country?

Maybe then I'd be able to pass my exams." [[color=purple]Uses metric system[/color]]

3. "Hey! I've found these comparisons very useful," blurts your brother, as he checks the latest football scores. "How long is a kilometre, how heavy is a gram? I don't know, 'cause I have problems picturing them in my mind. If you say the length of ten football fields or the weight of half a ping pong ball, then I get a better grasp of the size of things. From now on, @@NAME@@ must always use helpful comparisons alongside the usual measurements, so everyone will be able to grasp the width, or is it breadth?" [[color=purple]Does not use metric system[/color]]

4. "Hey! I've found these comparisons very useful," blurts your brother, as he checks the latest football scores. "How long is a kilometre, how heavy is a gram?

5. "Do you know how big that avalanche was?" hollers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an evacuee being grilled by journalists about whether the sound was more similar to a freight train or a thunderstorm. "I DON'T CARE! The scientists and mathematicians can sort that out later. All I know is that my town has been flattened and I expect the government to rebuild everything, even if it's going to cost them as much as two football stadiums!"

[b][anchor=1555]#1555[/anchor]: Deaf Trap [Cassinia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Celebrity "wellbeing guru" Gwen F. Poltroon recommended to her social media followers that they should regularly clean their ears with cotton swabs (more commonly known by their brand name 'Cute Yips'). This has prompted audiologists and ENT doctors to express concern that doing so can damage ears by packing wax deeper, irritating ear canals and sometimes even perforating eardrums.

The Debate
1. Your short-statured and short-tempered health minister waddles angrily into your office, red in the face. "I have three little words for you: BAN THEM. Uh... PLEASE. No matter what we do, people are still going to use them incorrectly. The general public has proven itself too stupid and too weak-willed to resist sticking them in their ears."

2. "Look, we market these things as beautician tools, arts and crafts items and multi-purpose medical application devices. It even says here in the leaflet that you shouldn't put them in your ears," complains the CEO of Cute Yips, absent-mindedly twiddling a cotton bud in his ear. "Still, you have to respect bodily autonomy, and the right of individuals to do unwise things. I mean, honestly, in the interests of personal freedom we ought to be allowing Cute Yips to be marketed and sold specifically for these purposes, instead of being all nudge-nudge-wink-wink about it."

3. In a booming voice, the entrepreneur inventor of EarVacCleaner interrupts: "Here is a new and innovative solution! With its ergonomic design, the EarVacs2000 has the power and precision to remove up to 3 ounces of earwax! With regular government-funded ear suctioning programs, people will be empty-eared and will have no need for cotton buds. The EarVacs is completely safe. Compweetwee saaaaayfe." His left eye twitches and one shoulder droops as he starts to drool.

[b][anchor=1556]#1556[/anchor]: Gimme Shelter [Nuremgard; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Recently, a transgender woman was murdered by her abusive partner, despite seeking refuge in a shelter for victims of domestic and sexual abuse days beforehand. It turns out that she was initially given shelter, but then forced to leave again when it transpired that she was transgender.

The Debate
1. "Look, I'm sure transgender women think they are women," retorts infamous feminist campaigner and author Jay Kayer-Owling. "Women at these shelters are trying to get away from abusive men. They can't feel safe if men are in the same place, and will be afraid to seek help because of it. Only biological women should be allowed in our safe spaces. Perhaps these men in dresses can have their own separate shelters, if they need them, where they can stay with people of their own sort."

2. "Don't listen to that TERF! It's disgusting and disgraceful that anyone could try to justify a woman being sent back into such a violent and dangerous situation!" exclaims prominent transgender rights campaigner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, threatening the author with a lacrosse stick to emphasise her point. "All women deserve protection and safety from abuse, whether they are transgender or cisgender. Women's shelters must not discriminate! If you are a woman and you need shelter you should be granted it."

3. "Actually, anyone can need shelter, and that includes men," observes men's rights activist Watt Abe Owtus, who has been slapped in the face by women many times. "Shelters should be gender-blind, and allow anyone who needs refuge to stay there, whether it's because of abuse, homelessness or because their mum has told them they can't stay in their basement any more. I mean, it might be a good place for nice guys like me to meet women who need a white knight to save them. Not all guys are abusers, you know!"

4. "Can we not just recognise that transgender people are immoral, mentally ill or both?" asks conservative commentator @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Men cannot become women and vice versa no matter how many surgeries or whatever they get. That's just biology. We should criminalize cross-dressing, ban transgender ideas, and admit for mandatory psychiatric treatment anyone who insists on pursuing this perversion."

[b][anchor=1557]#1557[/anchor]: The Artist Is Literally Present [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Noahs Second Country][/b]

The Issue
Performance artist Maureen A Hamsandwich is launching a new exhibition tomorrow, wherein she intends to sit silently in a chair eight hours a day for a whole month. Visitors are invited to freely make eye or even physical contact if they desire. Surprisingly, you have received a personal appointment, scheduled to be the first of many to lock gazes with her.

The Debate
1. "Static and silent, this is a piece that explores the power of stillness," enthuses a fidgety cultural aide who looks suspiciously similar to the artist but in a red wig, buzzing around you excitedly. "I heard that in a similar performance elsewhere, some visitors broke down in tears as they confronted their internal monologues. You should plan to do something like that, and show the people that you really get postmodern art." She giggles, then dashes out of the room.

2. "She's clearly some sort of masochist, just wanting people to poke and emotionally abuse her," observes a passing intern, seemingly the last speaker's blonde twin, firing an office staple gun into the back of her own hand to emphasise her point. "So-called "artists" like this deserve to be mocked. You should go in there, give her a slap, berate her for wasting everyone's time, then head back to work. Busy busy." She looks at her watch and walks out, purposefully.

3. "Frankly, the whole thing bores me," yawns a civil servant, whose grey wig seems to be slipping off as she rushes in, out of breath. "Clearly, you're being drawn into the performance, used to generate free publicity. The best thing you can do is ignore the whole charade, and go across town to a different exhibition that is opening on the same day. I have a pamphlet here: Treasures of Romanticism, a Retrospective on Landscape Paintings of the Sublime. Actual brushwork, and realistic pictures. That's proper art, with none of this performance nonsense. I'll go ahead and grab you a ticket." She strides off.

[b][anchor=1558]#1558[/anchor]: Unequal Treatment? [Erynia and Draconia, Courelli; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
During a press briefing, which had somehow been booked at a landscaping business on the rough side of town, one of your aides received a vicious paper cut. Almost immediately, your entourage found itself being led towards a set of dilapidated buildings to seek care. What your staff had mistaken for abandoned apartments turned out to be a hospital – a stark contrast to the world-class medical facilities in the posh enclaves across town.

The Debate
1. "For decades our health and well-being have been neglected, and we won't take it any longer!" declares exasperated local resident @@RANDOM_NAME@@, lingering next to you in the waiting room. "Are we not @@DEMONYM@@, too? My neighborhood shouldn't determine the quality of the healthcare facilities I visit, and I shouldn't have to sit in a dingy waiting room for hours just to see an overworked triage nurse who's already got twenty other patients! We demand more health subsidies for poor neighborhoods, and hey, maybe you can require that junior doctors serve in our hospitals for a few years, as a condition for getting their full license?"

2. "The problem isn't the resources they have – it's how they use them! Did you read about all the fraud, waste, and abuse going on?" interjects Minister of Health @@RANDOM_NAME@@, flipping through a spiral-bound copy of @@HIS@@ ministry's latest several-hundred-page report. "Hospitals like this are typically poorly equipped, poorly maintained, and churn through staff, because their administration is too busy paying for executive washrooms in their offices, and 'management retreats' at fancy resorts. What they really need is additional oversight! Allocate funds to my budget and I'll enact more stringent regulations, with routine inspections to ensure all hospitals are up to par."

3. "You can't put a bandage on a fourth degree burn and expect it to heal!" cries the hospital's head surgeon, suddenly leaping into the room with a reflex hammer in one hand and a diagram of a sickle cell in the other. "This is a symptom of that great plague upon our nation: for-profit healthcare! The rich can afford luxury treatment while the poor suffer in dirty, understaffed hospitals, all while insurance and pharmaceutical companies profit off their hardship. The solution is clear: nationalize healthcare, and let us provide equal care for all, regardless of residence, finance, or social class!"

4. "If you don't like the healthcare you're getting, pack up and move," butts-in @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a 'self-made' business@@MAN@@ here performing community service after @@HIS@@ most recent public escapades got reported to authorities. "What makes @@NAME@@ so great is that if you're unhappy with your current conditions, you can change them with just a little hard work. The government doesn't need to spend all this unnecessary money or make weird, complicated regulations. Instead, you should drastically cut your healthcare spending. That will encourage these unhappy people to find better jobs and improve their own circumstances. It's the @@DEMONYM@@ way!"

[b][anchor=1559]#1559[/anchor]: Skin's the Wrong Colour [Sacara; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
One of your nephews decided to go under the needle, and cover half of his body in a veritable panoply of tattoos depicting various scenes from a number of Nicolas Cage movies. As a result, he was fired from his job as a school receptionist.

The Debate
1. Your nephew, flexing his arm to make Ghost Rider and H. I. McDunnough dance with each other, complains to you: "This is nothing less than obvious discrimination! I was excelling at my job, had Employee of the Month three times running, my colleagues said I was a kick-ass national treasure. But as soon as I got all inked up, my job was stolen from me, gone in sixty seconds, given away to my assistant Mandy. There goes my job at Ridgemont High! You have to stop businesses from discriminating against those who want to express themselves. In fact, you have to protect the rights of free expression and bodily autonomy, and make sure that nobody ever is discriminated against for what they choose to write or draw on their body. You know, it could happen to anyone, it could happen to you."

2. "There's no good reason not to fire a person who chooses to put something like that on their body," counters school governor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Personally, I don't trust people who have tattoos; their rebellious self-mutilation suggests criminal nature and disrespect for authority. I want our employees to look professional, and to set a good example to children. He voluntarily altered his appearance, and the law must respect the right of employers to terminate employees who violate appearance standards."
