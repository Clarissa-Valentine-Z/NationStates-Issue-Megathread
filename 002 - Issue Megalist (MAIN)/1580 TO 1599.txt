[b][anchor=1580]#1580[/anchor]: Profitable for Doctrine [Tinhampton; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
A bored local priest, checking the math in @@HIS_1@@ parish’s budget documents, has discovered that the nation makes millions in tax revenue from sales of @@RELIGION@@’s most sacred text. The book’s liability for VAT, or Value Added Tax, immediately became the topic of @@HIS_1@@ next sermon, which @@HE_1@@ is now delivering to you.

The Debate
1. “This is undoubtedly a stain on the soul of @@NAME@@,” laments the priest, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, turning to page thirty-one of @@HIS_1@@ sermon. “Our houses of worship need repairs, our clergy need salaries, and our leaders need bigger private yachts to spread the word to more places. We work tirelessly to bring the message of @@RELIGION@@ to the people, but the donations we need won’t come from a population that feels priced out of the religion in the first place! If you waive VAT on the holy book, we can save both their souls and their wallets... and you can justify fining people who fail to attend services!”

2. “Why should some priest I haven’t seen in years have all the fun?” grumbles your least-pious intern, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, stashing a magazine of questionable morals behind @@HIS@@ back. “Sure, it’s the national religion, but why should it enjoy special tax privileges for whatever pamphlet it’s selling today, when comparable products offer much more exciting, err... educational content? If you’re going to slash VAT, do it for all printed material, no matter who it benefits, or how taboo it’s alleged to be! You can make up for it by raising taxes on the church hierarchy.”

3. “What nobody has mentioned is where all the money is going!” howls government minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who insists on being called your ‘Lord Spiritual’. “I’ve had multiple low-level staffers look into it, and they tell me that the VAT levied on the scriptures is going towards all sorts of secular purposes: abstract art festivals, street lighting for rural mud paths, food for the poor, you name it! It is a disgrace that such a religious nation doesn’t make sure the funds it raises from the faith stay in the faith. I’m not asking you to cut VAT or anything like that, just make sure the income goes where it’s needed the most — my ministry! I can’t imagine anyone who wouldn’t be delighted by this!”

[b][anchor=1581]#1581[/anchor]: Circling the Brain Drain [West Barack and East Obama; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A scheduled meeting with the nation’s top medical research think tank had to be cancelled after it transpired that every expert member of the group had emigrated to take up well-paid jobs overseas.

The Debate
1. “@@NAME@@ is suffering from a shortage of educated professionals across the board,” sighs your Minister of Manpower, as he takes a seat next to you in the empty conference room. “This exodus of professionals is grinding our economy to a halt. And who can blame them? They get paid twice as much to do the same job in another country. We must push for greater incentives for these professionals to remain, such as less progressive taxation and high income-friendly exemptions and loopholes. As an extra benefit, it means top earners like you and me will be better off too. Win-win!”

2. “Sure, professionals can make more in the United Federation or Brancaland, but did you know that a consultant neurosurgeon in poverty-stricken Bigtopia makes less than a janitor in @@NAME@@?” asks a nearby janitor, with a thick Bigtopian accent. “There’s no need to keep throwing money at ungrateful brats when you can fight fire with fire. If your country keeps losing its top academics to richer countries, just poach a few from poorer countries to replace them! Post adverts in poorer nations to recruit their professionals and create a visa fast-track and golden handshake scheme to make the whole process as painless as possible. It’s not brain surgery!”

3. “Even without this migration problem we still wouldn’t have enough skilled graduates to sustain our growing nation,” bemoans your Minister of Education, who takes a position at the lectern to lecture you. “We need to tackle the root cause of this problem, which is too few people with professional qualifications. Shift educational spending towards professional and job-related courses, and away from degrees and studies with no real world application.”

4. TBD

5. “Why are you even bothering with all these complicated solutions when there’s obvious and direct ways to stop people leaving?” asks your Minister of Security, slamming the door to the room closed to ensure nobody else can get in... or out. “If we don’t want them to leave, then don’t let them leave. Create some sort of exit visa system that only lets the least skilled workers leave the country. Failing all else, just tell them no, and take away their passports.”

[b][anchor=1582]#1582[/anchor]: Hospital Problems Ramping Up [Klaus Devestatorie, ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
Emergency departments in the public hospitals of @@NAME@@ are facing ever-increasing demand, and ambulances with patients in critical condition are regularly forced to “ramp” outside, queueing until a bed is available. After a five-hour wait caused an otherwise preventable death, your staff arranged for you to visit a hospital yourself to try and diagnose the cause of the delays.

The Debate
1. Before you’re even out of the car, you’re approached by @@RANDOMNAME@@, one of the drivers from a line of waiting ambulances. “If you’re here about that fatality, I can tell you right now that I’ve queued for a lot longer than five hours before! There’re a dozen ambulances here and someone is waiting in the back of each of them. That means there’re also a dozen ambulance crews that can’t save lives until there’s space here to free us up again. If you want us to cope, we need a drastic expansion of public emergency departments all over @@NAME@@!”

2. “There wouldn’t be anything like the current delays if ED staff were allowed to prioritize things properly”, moans @@RANDOMNAME@@, an exhausted-looking doctor slumped against a wall near the entrance. “Frankly, many of the people waiting for treatment don’t have anything particularly serious. We’ve got hypochondriacs, minor sniffles, and even people who just want to get out of the weather! The emergency department needs to be saved for people with actual emergencies. Can’t we just tell people with minor issues to make an appointment with their regular doctor?”

[3.] “But you can’t let them turn me away! I can’t go anywhere else!” howls @@RANDOMNAME@@, an elderly woman waiting inside for a doctor to examine her papercut. “I’d love to visit a private clinic, but I’m retired, and it costs a ridiculous amount of money to speak to anyone other than a receptionist! This is the only place that won’t demand payment up front. Since you already pay for care at public hospitals, surely you can cover private clinic fees as well for us vulnerable people? It’s not as if I like sitting here all day either!” [[color=purple]Must not have Geronticide policy[/color]]

4. Upon returning to your car, there’s a message waiting for you from @@RANDOMNAME@@, an insurance executive with an eye for opportunity. “I know not everyone is keen on privatising any part of the system, especially hospitals, but it’s a waste of my company’s capabilities if we’re relegated to administering government coverage for the pre-existing public hospital network. There’s no reason why we shouldn’t be allowed to operate our own emergency departments for anyone willing to pay! It’s the simplest and cheapest solution — for the government, at least. Don’t overthink it.”

[b][anchor=1583]#1583[/anchor]: Spare the (Plutonium) Rod [Cretox State; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
The chief engineer at the nation's largest nuclear power plant recently passed away after trying to skateboard down the side of a cooling tower. However, something even more bizarre than that has happened: some concerned busybodies with too much time on their hands are now demanding that you impose some form of regulation on the industry.

The Debate
1. "What do you expect us to do?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the nuclear safety inspector at Dankushima Nuclear Power Plant, as @@HE@@ stirs a cup of coffee with a glowing green rod. "Tell engineers to stop using the reactor core as a tanning bed? Board up the heavy water dunk tank? Give me a break! Tell you what, keep your government health and safety inspectors — and any kind of government oversight — away from our industry. We've got this, okay!"

2. "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds," intones Bobby Noppenheimer, a former worker at an old coal-powered plant. "I'm talkin' about the way this nuclear tech has killed the pre-nuclear world. These monstrosities are makin' everyone who works in them and lives nearby really sick and they're clearly unsafe! Us old-school power plant folks are losin' our jobs too, and tryin' to regulate these behemoths is clearly pointless! Just ban this nuclear nonsense and take the power back to how it was in the good ol' days."

3. "Both ideas are not great, not terrible," says Anthony Stephenov, acting chief engineer at the plant. "You shouldn't ban generally safe nuclear power over silly claims like 'people's skin shouldn't spontaneously combust' or 'an inspector's coffee shouldn't glow in the dark'; however, some of the more ridiculous games like Fuel Rod Frisbee and Geiger Counter Challenge need to go. Whilst a bit of basic safety training wouldn't go amiss, we shouldn't have to scrap our entire way of doing things just because some people got cancer or a few rivers burst into flames."

[b][anchor=1584]#1584[/anchor]: Loose Lips, Characters Shipped? [Novo Terres; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
In what has become the latest cultural controversy to strike @@NAME@@, the highly anticipated series finale of the long-running fantasy cartoon show Time Adventure saw two of the protagonist’s main male companions share a brief, romantic kiss, confirming a decade’s worth of rumors surrounding their relationship. Since this is nominally a children’s show, your office was soon animated by a cast of opinionated characters that is nearly as colorful as the ones seen on screen.

The Debate
1.“C’mon, grab your friends!” shouts Cora Sami, hustling a group dressed in various pieces of medieval paraphernalia to the front. “I KNEW IT! Nobody believed me when I said Prince Marcel and Bon Bon the Vampire King were dating! The other fans called me all sorts of nasty, homophobic names for years, which only proves we ought to have greater queer representation in our media! And not just the occasional peck on the cheek to queerbait folk like us — people of all ages need to see that these kinds of couples are just as healthy and ordinary as those in straight relationships, thereby normalizing them in everyday life. If you could subsidize the production of more high-quality, queer-friendly shows, you’d be just as heroic as Finnegan when he realizes that all he needs to defeat Glod is the power of song!”

2. “What is she even talking about? This is a show designed for KIDS. Is everyone ignoring that?” screeches househusband and parental rights activist Steve Conley, swaddling an infant as he desperately tries to pull his son away from the horde of cosplayers. “Kids cannot be exposed to sexuality — and I mean ANY sexuality, gay or straight — at such a young age! It’s absolutely indecent. What adults do with their own time is their own business, but marketing a colorful cartoon show directly to kids, and then adding in that sort of sexual content... it’s practically propaganda! You should set up a government review board for all media to keep smut out of the hands of our youth.”

[3.] “Subsidies and censorship, that’s all you statists ever talk about!” bellows prominent libertarian keyboard-warrior Quinn Eyvee, refusing to take off her fedora in your presence, which is presumably her way of disrespecting the very concept of government. “I’m all for queer representation in media — during the finale, I was really hoping for a ‘tender’ moment between the Ice Damsel and the Duchess of Lemonade, if you catch my drift — but why does ‘Papa Government’ have to intervene at all? As if it doesn’t already control every other aspect of our lives! Let companies decide for themselves what they want to put on the TV screen, and if you have a problem, lobby them instead. And as for YOU, @@LEADER@@, keep your hands off my media!”

*4. “None of these fools see the true value in this cartoon: a dystopian call to action!” babbles your advisor, Kat Tradora, drawing a series of mushroom clouds on your walls in crayon. “[i]Time Adventure[/i] takes place in a post-apocalyptic reality where weapons of mass destruction have practically made all human life extinct! Hence all of the vampires and kingdoms made of candy and whatever... but never mind all of this other talk! We need to make certain that if such an eventuality is ever reached, we’re ready for it! I’m talking bunkers, countermeasures, and, you guessed it, a massive thermonuclear weapons stockpile. Let these moral crusaders fight the culture war — there are real wars to be won!”

The Issue
A man just posted nude videos of his ex-partner engaging in various compromising activities on an online message board. This is just the latest example in a long string of similar online harassment cases that have been dubbed ‘revenge porn’. Your team of advisors has spent days looking at it, from every angle, but it seems there is currently no reference to this phenomenon in any Edushian legislation.

The Issue

A man just posted nude videos of his ex-partner engaging in various compromising activities on an online message board. This is just the latest example in a long string of similar online harassment cases that have been dubbed 'revenge porn'. Your team of advisors has spent days looking at it, from every angle, but it seems there is currently no reference to this phenomenon in any @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ legislation.

The Debate

1. "First off," shouts one of your legal advisors, "can we stop calling it 'revenge porn'? That clearly implies the victim has done something to deserve that kind of disgraceful mistreatment. Digitally Inflicted Criminal Castigation, please, and this is a particularly lowly form of harassment and sexual abuse. We need explicit and stringent legislation outlawing distributing, or threatening to distribute, a sexual image or video without consent. Only then will these poor victims get justice. We should also start some public information campaigns to teach people about the horrors of DICC."

2. "Where do you draw the line?" asks another one of your legal advisors, in a calmer tone than that of the previous speaker. "A law like that has risks of draconian miscarriages of justice written all over it, and it'll just end up a well-intended, but poorly executed, infringement of artistic freedoms and freedom of expression. This 'revenge porn', or DICC business, is just a specific form of harassment, right? I bet we have tons of other laws that — more or less — could cover this kind of thing. There're privacy laws, tort law and even copyright laws! Combine that with some criminal law and I'm sure you've got a case. Just because nobody has ever been convicted for something like that using laws like these, doesn't mean no one ever will be, right? Right."

3. "Pervs need to be weeded out before they act," interrupts yet another of your legal advisors. "We must prevent these incidents from happening as much as we can, and this is the perfect opportunity for letting the police surveil the internet more. I say whoever is caught watching any of these 'DICC pics' should be punished most severely. Actually, make that watching pornography in general; smut breeds smut, as Charlie Diccens used to say."

4. "Turnabout is fair play," interjects the IT-guy, who has been helping your legal team research instances of 'revenge porn'. "I've got software that can create unusually unflattering pornographic deepfakes of anyone the user has a face picture of, and then automatically send them to their entire contact list. People won't dare to post 'revenge porn' pics and videos if they know that kind of backlash will be popping up in their mom's inbox; it worked for MAD, it can work for DICC too! And heck, even if it doesn't, it'll so saturate people's expectations that real nudes getting out won't bother people so much. It's win-win... win!"

[b][anchor=1586]#1586[/anchor]: Don’t Point That Thing at Me! [Mierria; ed: Westinor][/b]

The Issue
An increasing number of advocacy groups across @@NAME@@ are showing up at political assemblies armed to the teeth. With the waves of shotgun-slinging school teachers and bazooka-brandishing businessmen showing no signs of stopping, even the most gun-friendly of politicians are going ballistic over the lack of government action.

The Debate
1. “Look, we all love the right to own and carry,” reasons the mayor of @@CAPITAL@@, who was recently threatened by a grenade-wielding granny over the quality of groceries. “But surely armed threats and acts of public intimidation take that right too far! You and I simply can’t do our jobs like this — please, @@LEADER@@, put a ban on guns in public places and end this mayhem!”

2. “Hey, hands off my heater!” growls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a libertarian activist who insists on watching your every move. “When we established the right to bear arms, this is exactly what we had in mind! The whole point, besides safety and shooting birds out of the sky for fun, is to keep politicians in line with the people. The threat of an armed and free populace is much scarier for politicians than any war could ever be, and exercising that right should NEVER be a crime.” @@HE@@ glares at you as @@HE@@ begins to polish @@HIS@@ rifle menacingly in your direction.

3. “These loons are out of control!” declares your Minister of Finance, as @@HE@@ drops the annual budget proposal on your desk with a satisfying thud. “You know what? I think it’s about time we equipped public figures with guns too — proper guns. That way, when they start firing at us, we can shoot back.” @@HE@@ flips to a page filled with earmarks for grenade launchers and flamethrowers, and begins to cackle.

[b][anchor=1587]#1587[/anchor]: @@DEMONYM@@, Interrupted [Reploid Productions][/b]

The Issue
A hard-hitting exposé into the treatment of citizens with developmental disabilities at the Sallowscreek State Residential Centre has shocked viewers with its images of filthy conditions, overcrowded dorms crammed with rusty bedframes, and emotional testimony of rampant abuses perpetrated by undertrained and callous staff. Angry families and disability rights advocates are demanding action to fix what they decry as a “festering snakepit.”

The Debate
1. “People with disabilities deserve the same basic dignity as everybody else! They shouldn’t be shoved out of sight and mind, warehoused like cattle, and tortured like this!” asserts Dr. Sebastian Hart, the author of several studies on the treatment of developmental disorders, some of which have even been published in actual scientific journals. “We need to provide tools for citizens with disabilities so they can fully integrate into their communities. With just a little money for supported living programmes that protect their rights and teach vocational skills, the more abled could even join the workforce. More workers means more tax @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@. Everybody wins!”

2. “You want to waste our tax @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ on WHAT?” scoffs conventionally attractive Amir Orbison, head of the @@CAPITAL@@ University Minarchist Club, who heard the word ‘snake’ and came sprinting from a campaign to ‘save the poor tax havens’. “Sure, close those money sinks down, but divert those funds to more important things, like protecting the property of those of us who’ve earned it! If these folks want to be treated like normal people, they should earn it too. I mean, if you can’t get something on your own merit, should you even want it?”

3. “Integration? Putting them out on the streets? Madness!” shouts Elizabeth vonBismarck while keeping her three children hidden behind her. “Either way would expose our healthy, normal children to these re... I mean, poor disabled persons. This story’s sad, but all it shows is that we need to improve these centres. The sound reasons for institutionalizing haven’t gone away: it’s bad enough when an infant has a tantrum, but when an adult has one, it’s simply unsightly — not to mention distressing for we who might see it. More funding for training, improved staff ratios, and better facilities will help keep them comfortable and prevent abuses in their separate spaces.”

4. “And she calls herself a parent? It’s beyond me!” tuts Patty Conway, easing some leaflets about community living from the hands of her forty-year-old son, who has some developmental delay. “When Gordon was born, doctors told me to put him away; forget him. That he’d be a burden. As though the sweetest soul on Violet’s green earth could ever be a burden. We need to reduce the population of those so-called ‘residential centres’; send the children home and transfer the funding to their families. Parents should parent, no matter how old their children are.”

5. Hack Mortendotter, your Minister of Ethically Questionable Research, slides quietly into your office and opens a black bag full of small vials of formaldehyde. “There is another solution to the problem, @@LEADER@@. What if we could work out the cause of human defects, fix them and — in time — make all these centres obsolete? Think about it: we have a steady supply of perfectly useful defective people whose families are happy to forget they existed. We should utilize that resource in scientific research. For instance, what if these individuals could surgically be perfected? Is it possible? Who knows? But won’t it be fun to try?”

[b][anchor=1588]#1588[/anchor]: More Popular Than @@FAITH@@ [Fr ance; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The Beat-Alls, an insanely popular Albionian rock and roll band, has arrived in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Lead singer Len Johnnon proclaimed the band to be “more popular than @@FAITH@@” in an interview, which has sparked outrage among your most pious citizens. As you head into work a few days later, there appears to be a bonfire of Beat-Alls albums and merchandise on the front lawn.

The Debate
1. “HOW DARE HE DISPARAGE OUR FAITH!” shouts an angry demonstrator while ripping apart a Beat-Alls album and chewing on a Singo Starr doll’s severed head. “I used to be a fan of these heathens! I guess you really never can meet your heroes... or in this case, I suppose you can’t pay attention to any of their interviews, or read their fan club magazine, or go to their concerts in the hope that Forge Barryson sees you and thinks you’re cute and is overcome by a sudden urge to ask you on a date and... um... Anyway, I say we put strict guidelines on what musicians can and can’t say — and that includes their song lyrics! That’ll show them!”

2. “I’m so tired of these fools on the hill. I meant nothing! Why are religious people so crazy nowadays?” asks Len Johnnon, whose latest non-apology interview is emanating from a nearby radio. “If I’d have said television was more popular than @@FAITH@@, I might have gotten away with it! But that’s beside the point. I want to tell you, everyone needs to just let it be and come together. Maybe your government could sponsor some sort of free speech and tolerance festival? With a little help from my friends in the band, I’d be happy to play a few sets and show that all you need is love.”

3. “I read the news today — oh boy. You know, honey pie, we wouldn’t be in this mess if we didn’t allow foreign music into our nation,” suggests your Minister of Security, who just came in through the bathroom window to avoid the protestors. “That band is from Albionia, a place known for hooligans that like to cause trouble abroad. If we just outlawed all foreign music and offered free lessons to aspiring local musicians, things would turn around more smoothly than a used record. Wait...”

The Issue
The Merovingian President is en route to @@NAME@@ for a state visit. However, the man is extremely tactile, always keen to over-extend handshakes, to hug at the slightest provocation, and even to cordially rest his left hand on inner thighs during conversations.

The Debate
1. “We need some sort of strategy to keep a diplomatic distance here,” whispers your Minister of Safe Spaces, leaning in conspiratorially to just under seven inches from your nose. “We can position your chairs on opposite sides of a large table, and ensure that at all the events you attend there will be always be an aide or three between you. That way he can’t be tempted to get too touchy.”

2. “Zut alors, this is not the president being trop romantique!” points out Pierre, a Merovingian diplomat. “He is not asking you ‘voulez-vous coucher avec moi’! Non! This is just the Merovingian way of being polite. You should just embrace him hard, take his bœuf bourguignon in hand, and plant a kiss on each of his cheeks. This will show you are a politicien du monde, hein?”

3. “We should neither be manoeuvring to avoid his advances, nor be forced to be inappropriately manhandled,” snaps dog trainer Milo Cesar, grabbing Pierre by the collar, and forcing him away from you. “Instead, the next time the Merovingian President touches you, just hold one hand up, and sharply scold him with a loud ‘No! Bad man! Sit!’ He, and all the other grab-happy gropers, need to be told that it is never acceptable to touch anybody without permission. Indeed, there must be a law against it!”

The Issue
Predictions of an unusually cold upcoming winter and a nostalgic trend towards old-fashioned home comforts have seen a spike in the number of fireplace installations, which are increasingly recognised as having significant health and environmental impacts.

The Debate
1. “Wood-burning fires are ecologically irresponsible,” complains environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, who has spent all morning handing ‘Save the Trees’ pamphlets to passers-by. “Good timber is being sent up in smoke, releasing carbon and particulate matter into the world. Ban fireplaces and domestic open fires now!”

2. “Whilst we’re at it, we should be banning oil and gas heaters in all newly constructed buildings as well. They’re bad, so bad, you know it,” adds @@HIS_1@@ companion, a pop star famous for his eco-conscious hit single ‘Mud Song’. “There’s plenty of other ways to keep warm indoors: air and ground source heat pumps, thermally passive buildings, or just wearing more clothes. If we want to make the world a better place, we gotta look at the man in the mirror, and make a change.”

3. Striding into your office brandishing a chainsaw, leathery-faced lumberjack Jed Sawyer swings the tool about erratically as he speaks. “You can’t bloody take away me wood fire! Ain’t nuffin’ better than a good ole fashion wood fire! Beautiful to look **cough** at, and there ain’t nuffin’ better to warm us up! **cough** Better than that electric heater **cough** garbage. And we’d been doin’ it for hundreds of years, and ain’t none of us gotten sick and the world still ain’t gotten hotter. Hundreds of years of burnin’ wood, and it’s still bloody freezin’! In fact, wood is good for the **cough** environment, you just gotta grow more of it! And burn more of it, sure, but that’s gotta be good for the **cough** economy.”

4. “Air pollution is only a problem if it reaches the lungs, right?” posits self-proclaimed Holistic Pneumologist @RANDOM_NAME@@, profferring a model of a decaying lung to you. “But if we make builders install really tall chimneys, then surely there would be no problem?”

[b][anchor=1591]#1591[/anchor]: (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Sample!) [Southland; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
Sampling — taking snippets of existing audio to be used or remixed in other songs — has become the latest trend among the nation’s hot new musical acts. After it was discovered that the producers of several popular albums had not received permission to use these samples, a related and not-coincidental trend emerged of record companies filing lawsuits demanding compensation.

The Debate

*1. “Our acts form the backbone of today’s most popular songs,” snaps high-powered blue-haired lawyer Ariel Vercingetorix of the recording giant World Music Group, “and not once have we been compensated! Take Bigtopianz Wit Attitudes’ [i]Straight Outta @@CAPITAL@@[/i], Life Slaps’ [i]The Currency Boutique[/i], and The L/M/G’s [i]1984 (What the Heck is Happening?)[/i]. Half the samples on these albums came from WMG’s catalogue. How many times were they streamed on Stripeify? Millions! How many @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ were we paid? Exactly zero. The government must legislate that all samples have to be cleared by the original recording label, no matter the cost, length, or obscurity!” [[color=blue]Must not ban internet.[/color], [color=blue]Must not ban computers.[/color]]

*2. “Our acts form the backbone of today’s most popular songs,” snaps high-powered blue-haired lawyer Ezra Wall, of the recording giant World Music Group, “and not once have we been compensated! Take Bigtopianz Wit Attitudes’ [i]Straight Outta @@CAIPTAL@@[/i], Life Slaps’ [i]The Currency Boutique[/i], and The L/M/G’s [i]1984 (What the Heck is Happening?)[/i]. Half the samples on these albums came from WMG’s catalogue. How many sales did these albums have? Millions! How many dollars were we paid? Exactly zero. The government must legislate that all samples have to be cleared by the original recording label, no matter the cost, length, or obscurity!” [[color=red]Must ban internet.[/color] OR [color=red]Must ban computers.[/color]]

3. “We wanted to pay for the samples,” interjects Ed Cumberbatch, better known as Ol’ Dirty @@ANIMAL@@ of Bigtopianz Wit Attitudes, whose normally coarse language and slovenly appearance are now restrained and well-groomed. “We gave up when they made unrealistic demands. To sample a single chord progression from the unknown Muddywater Revivals tune [i]Crescent Moon Arises[/i] they wanted seventy percent of our song’s profits. Then they separately demanded seventy-five percent to use five seconds of Emperor Crimson’s [i]23rd Millennium Bipolar Dude[/i] on the same track! It’s mathematically impossible! I beg you, declare that samples under, say, 6 seconds are covered by fair use. By sparing us this headache, you’ll save War Dog music and allow the creativity of a thousand acts to bloom.”

4. “Yo, my name is Minister Yoko Roberts and I’m here to say, that I have a sweet idea that involves equitable pay!” freestyles your Minister of Compromises. After seeing her verse met with dead silence, an embarrassed Roberts clears her throat and continues. “Sorry, I heard it on a cereal commercial. Anyway, I suggest that the government set an affordable flat fee per second for all samples, regardless of length or popularity. That will prevent price-gouging, while ensuring that the labels still get paid. It’ll even let us sneak in a tax! Sure, the labels will feel they’re not being properly compensated and some artists will still chafe about paying, but you know what they say about a good compromise.”

5. “I have a proposition for you boss,” interrupts multimillionaire producer and entrepreneur Dr. Me, who just wrapped up an 18-hour concert with the @@CAPITAL@@ Symphony Orchestra. “Me and my boys back at the studio have been recording instrumentals for our talent. If you’re willing to pay us up front, we’ll create a free music catalogue for all of @@NAME@@’s up-and-coming artists. Our beats will surpass all this copyrighted music, and you’ll create jobs for the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ music community. What’s not to love? I’ll throw in some of my ‘Tempos for Me’ earbuds for your staff to sweeten the deal.”

1. “Do you understand how truly terrifying this is?” screeches @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Averting Existential Crises, as @@HE@@ frantically screens through the WhoTube videos of @@HIS@@ public addresses. “Earlier today I could’ve sworn I’d heard audio of you making a 13-year-old cry at a public meet and greet alongside the leader of Maxtopia — so you’re telling me you’re not planning on merging our militaries to take over the world? Can’t say I’m not relieved; he can hardly put two sentences together... hey, your words, not mine! I think. Clearly, we need to ban all voice generation AI immediately, before this gets out of control.”

2. “I thought it was hilarious!” chuckles your office systems administrator @@RANDOM_NAME@@ over a remote phone line, audibly tinkering with @@HIS@@ laptop. “I know it’s daunting how quickly this technology is advancing, but think of all the industries that could benefit from it! Enhanced automated text narration in entertainment, greater accessibility in education, improved translation services, the list goes on...” The same program used to copy your voice finishes for @@HIM@@. “The advantages of using text-to-speech language models are numerous and provide limitless avenues for economic gain.”

3. “There is more to this than meets the ears, my dear @@LEADER@@...” orates Intelligence Director and wannabe playwright @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pausing for suspense. “Imagine it — with this technology in our hands, we have the chance to add a little bit of [i]dramatic flourish[/i] to words uttered everywhere! Drug capos ordering their henchmen into our police stings, Blackacrean spies reporting false intel... it’s a brave new world! And of course, anything you’d say would be subject to the same treatment. Who’s to say that Dàguó agents or rebel insurgents aren’t AI-generating those truly appalling things they claim you said about the Violetstone Tribe, or, say... the transcripts of this meeting? Ooh, that’s a twist. Write that down.”

[b][anchor=1593]#1593[/anchor]: Flap Over Flag Fashion [Lislandia; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
In celebration of the founding anniversary of @@NAME@@, an ardent fan of yours has sent you a homemade outfit created out of the national flag. The question of whether it is appropriate to don the flag as apparel has created a flutter of excitement.

The Debate
1. “This isn’t just disrespectful,” bemoans Rear Admiral @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ buffs the @@NAME@@ flag pin on @@HIS@@ lapel, “this is borderline sacrilegious! Why, just last week some of my sailors who were on leave reported seeing crowds of people at the beach clad in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@-flag swimsuits! SWIMSUITS! The flag should never be worn as clothing, and it is high time we cracked down on people who deface this hallowed emblem of our country. Impose heavy fines, have probation officers accompany them on shopping trips — whatever it takes for people to pledge their allegiance in the right way!”

2. “This guy’s full of hot air!” fumes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your fiercely patriotic Minister of Orwellian Orthodoxy. “Not only should people be allowed to wear the flag however and whenever they want, we should also mandate that everybody wear at least one thing with the flag on it at all times! That way, you will know who truly salutes you and this great country! Please Leader, give this plan your unflagging support!”

3. “If I may, I’d like to run an idea up the flagpole,” interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, director of the Vexillological Association of @@NAME@@. “Why don’t we unfurl a national flag code that outlines the proper etiquette for when to use — or not to use — the nation’s banner in any context? For example, flag-themed handkerchiefs would be marvellous to show off our patriotism whenever we host diplomatic events. However, patches on the buttocks of jeans show a bit of disrespect: have any offenders clean up the streets on community service after said diplomatic event!”

[b][anchor=1594]#1594[/anchor]: Bitter Bob the Builder [The Ice States; ed: Kaschovia][/b]

The Issue
Spiteful billionaire Bob @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, bitter after four of his latest mansion designs were rejected, has vowed to build a monstrous apartment complex right in front of your office building. Multiple members of your cabinet, concerned the breathtaking views of @@CAPITAL@@ from your windows could be blocked, insist you address the issue of these ‘spite buildings’ before construction commences.

The Debate
1. “We cannot possibly let this go ahead!” spits your eternally-angry Chief of Enforcement @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clutching @@HIS@@ fists tighter by the second. “Blocking those gorgeous views of @@CAPITAL@@ is bad enough, but boasting such obnoxious disrespect for our glorious government is nothing short of treason! Any building, or billionaire for that matter, to purposefully inconvenience you ought to be judged more damningly than to simply call them ‘spiteful’. Give my team the nod and I’ll have any eyesore you want demolished or hubristic billionaire arrested before sundown.”

2. “Yes, such an ugly building would be an attack on government eyes,” muses your hawkish Minister of Construction @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shuffling a stack of mysterious folders, “but this is a much broader issue than the one planned solely to block your office. Our usual detractors could be quick to claim overt corruption or even... a cult of personality. Instead, we must impose more stringent regulations across the board, banning the construction of all ‘spite buildings’ whether you’re the target or not, prioritising the protection of our nation’s most scenic vistas. Today cannot be the day we throw our splendid views of @@ANIMAL@@ Boulevard and @@CAPITAL@@ Street away.”

3. High-flying socialite @@RANDOM_NAME@@, accompanied by @@HIS@@ miserable-looking teenage son, slams a designer briefcase on your desk. “I understand why you’d be upset about this, but six-hundred wealthy tenants, willing to pay by the bucket-load for the views you so desperately claim, would beg to differ that Bob is the spiteful one here. A completely reliable source told me there’ll be heated swimming pools, designer fashion boutiques, and even a private hair salon in the complex! In the name of civil freedom, the government has no right dictating what can or cannot be built on private property, especially on the grounds of hurt feelings or so-called spite.”

[b][anchor=1595]#1595[/anchor]: Plausible Deniability [Caracasus; ed: Westinor][/b]

The Issue
A remote town in @@NAME@@ found itself consumed in mass hysteria and hallucinations for three days, sparking viral conspiracy theories that a shady, government-led research program had been conducting covert, psychological experimentation on the residents.

The Debate
1. “These fools don’t know what they’re saying!” hisses top general @@RANDOM_NAME@@, checking under your desk for hidden reporters. “No such research exists! Though, uh, just to loop you in, it does exist. Experiments like this one, known as MS-SUPER, are run by a private research group that we’ve allowed to operate in return for access to their data. We’ve managed to keep things on the down-low for a while, but now those eggheads and their sloppy security are putting us all at risk! Deny the allegations and put MS-SUPER under the full command and supervision of the military — we’ll make sure nothing else gets loose. Then we’ll finally crack down on some of that ridiculous blue sky research they’ve been conducting and focus on what’s important: developing non-conventional weapons for our armed services!”

2. “This... really happened?” stutters town resident @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, watching himself groom a disturbed-looking cat with his tongue on a laboratory playback tape. “I... they made me think I was a cat... for the sake of experimentation? Oh, the humanity — we’re citizens, not test subjects! We deserve justice! You have to launch an inquiry into every level of government, find everyone involved in this insanity and do unto them what was done to us!”

3. The door to your office creaks open, revealing your bewildered secretary. “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear everything from the other side of the door. Personally, a government-wide inquiry seems like a massive hassle for me to schedule. Why not make a clear statement on what’s been going on in MS-SUPER, and mandate that experimentation on human subjects require expressed consent? Seems simple to me — after all, I’m not opposed to that.” He gestures at @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, who is purring aggressively. “Just, you know, buy me dinner first.”

4. A dark-suited figure appears from the shadows, jabbing syringes into your secretary’s neck and @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@’s arm, before easing them both into unconsciousness. “Shh, shh... There, there.” The figure peers over you to look at the tape. “Ah, I remember that. And that. Not sure about that one though. Okay, I’ll admit this got out of hand — MS-SUPER was supposed to help us pry the secrets from the minds of enemy captives, but there was a bit of a... slip-up in applying the treatment. But hey, you can’t make an omelet without kidnapping and torturing the occasional civilian. If anything, this demonstrates how effective our techniques are — just invest a little bit more into our research and we’ll get you the results you need. As to the public, the sensible solution is to overwhelm them with lies, until everyone dismisses claims of any crazy experiment as nonsense. Try a classic conspiracy theory, like planes dosing swaths of @@NAME@@ with drugs — Wait, we did that too. Well, you get the idea.”

[b][anchor=1596]#1596[/anchor]: The Blame Game [The Free Joy State; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
After an incident in which a teenage gang broke into the home of your Minister of Justice, tied @@HIM@@ up, flogged @@HIM@@ with @@HIS@@ own extension cord, urinated on @@HIS@@ prized orchid, and left @@HIM@@ helplessly listening to overly peppy nursery rhymes repeated at maximum volume all night, citizens are demanding a solution to the rising youth crime.

The Debate
1. “The problem is the lack of sunshine, activity and healthy, fresh air!” notes permatanned physiologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who sports a T-shirt reading [i]Joggers Do It For the Endorphins![/i] “How many teens in @@NAME@@ are desperately unhappy and unfit? Is it any wonder these youths behave in a way detrimental to themselves and others? We ought to drag these kids out in the fresh air, and get them exercising in the brilliant sunshine! It’s for their own good, really.”

2. “Don’t blame it on the sunshine; blame it on the moonlight,” insists police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was once voted the least jolly police@@MAN@@ in @@NAME@@. “These droogs are cavorting ’til all hours, drinking their milk plus, causing mischief and whatnot. There’s no reason for them to be in the streets and stores and such, when they should be home, safe and out of trouble. Institute a fixed curfew, and make every rotten little brat get home before dark.”

3. “Don’t blame the sunshine or the moonlight; blame their parents’ obsession with having a good time,” grumbles childless traditionalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, founder of conservative parents’ advisory service [i]Rightist Parents are Right Parents[/i]. “Parents these days are obsessed with easy-answer self-help books like [i]You are Fab; It’s Everyone Else That Sucks[/i], with socialising, with shopping, and with doing it! If they choose to squander their lives on minutiae, if they are too selfish to supervise their children voluntarily, the state should force them. Make it an offence for any child to not be accompanied by a parent. Always.”

4. “We need to put the blame where it belongs: on the boogie!” roars oddly motionless evangelical preacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@. “Young people dance to music that carries intoxicating beats that seep into their bodies, infecting them with sinful syncopations. Soon, their minds are so addlepated by pleasure-seeking lyrics and pulsing rhythms, they cannot think clearly. Wrong seems right. Then you have sass, youth crime and salacious snogging. The way to sleep safely in our beds is clear: ban dancing, and any music with wicked rhythms that could lead to dancing.”

[b][anchor=1597]#1597[/anchor]: Haters Are Such a Drag [Falafelandia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Drag shows, a form of cross-dressing entertainment, are growing in popularity in television and theater, ranging from risqué slapstick to more “adult-only” performances. Conservative groups are up in arms against this new trend.

The Debate
1. “These [i]people[/i] are ruining our society,” wails concerned parent @@RANDOM_NAME_FEMALE@@, protectively clutching her 13-year-old son. “They’re corrupting our children, tricking them into believing that their twisted lifestyle is somehow normal and acceptable! These so-called entertainers are nothing more than morally corrupt brainwashers, undermining heteronormative family values. Why, just two weeks ago I caught little Tommy here hiding a women’s underwear catalogue under his bed, and staring longingly at a teenage girl in a dress! In the name of decency, completely ban the abomination of cross-dressing once and for all!”

2. “@@LEADER@@, we demand the right to free expression,” booms drag artist Jenny Tallkiss, adjusting her gusset. “Allow us queens and kings to perform! Plenty of kids have said that they enjoy our family-friendly performances. Some jokes go over their heads, sure, but if their parents want a double entendre I’m always happy to give them one. Don’t let the killjoys spit at our act, when others are happy to swallow it. These attempts to erase @@DEMONYM@@ culture are about as welcome as a dose of syphilis. Hey, you should formally show your support for us by doing your next speech in drag! Or are you already in character? Hard to tell, darling, hard to tell.”

3. “Now, now, stop all that fighting,” condescends your Minister of Compromise, firmly twisting the cap on a bottle of Eckie-Cola, only to have much of the liquid fizz up and dribble onto the floor. “Let people go to drag shows but ban children from them. That would make everyone happy, right? Except for the conservatives and the drag artists... but you can’t please everyone.”

4. “That entire argument is arbitrary, absurd, and aimless,” admonishes the assertive Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted child psychologist and author of the bestseller [i]Categorize Your Child[/i]. “Some drag interludes are wholly inappropriate for children, others are entirely innocent and innocuous, and some are frankly so filthy that even adults shouldn’t be exposed to them. Accordingly, the government must assess the acceptability of acts, assign them an access rating, and mandate who can and cannot view any given performance. Now, let’s discuss the organizational system of your files.”

[b][anchor=1598]#1598[/anchor]: Weeping Widows [Jutsa; ed: Kaschovia][/b]

The Issue
Several church officials across @@NAME@@ have spurred controversy after refusing to preside over marriages where one or both of the parties are widowed, alleging that it would be unfaithful to their late spouses.

The Debate
1. “It’s sacrilege, plain and simple!” snaps stubborn officiant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose village church has declined marriages to dozens of devastated widows. “Remarriage completely betrays the oath of eternal love and scourges family honor. I mean, can you imagine how awkward the afterlife would be for these blasphemers? It should be the law of the land, not just of the church, to deny the solemn blessing of marriage to those who have married before, even if their dearly beloved is, well... dearly departed.”

2. “Love prevails beyond death!” asserts local playwright @@RANDOM_NAME@@, handing out flyers for @@HIS@@ next one-act. “Divorce is indeed an act of sin against the eternal bond of marriage, but no registrar in this holy land ought to be empowered to deny widows another beloved. All star-crossed lovers entwined in the wake of death should have the right to the boundless bounties of love! Oh, @@LEADER@@, can’t you spare these poor souls the horrors of lifelong loneliness?”

3. “That’s a bit extreme...” sighs muddy gravedigger @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hoisting a rusty shovel over @@HIS@@ shoulder. “Sure, some churches might believe in officiating remarriages for the divorced, but the clergy should be allowed to think otherwise. They’re not all the same, you know! Divorce ought to stay illegal to stop ’lopements, but for the Great Creator’s sake, let the churches make their minds up on their own. Tough luck if the nearest willing church is a pilgrimage away.”

4. “When I said until death do us part, I didn’t mean for both of us!” bemoans widow @@RANDOM_NAME_FEMALE@@, who you’ve heard is suspected of dismembering her late husband. “It’s not fair that I should have to spend the rest of my life alone because my husband croaked. What if I bump into my next targe- um, soulmate, on the way home? You should allow divorce and remarriage, @@LEADER@@. Love sometimes ends in rather unexpected ways...”

5. “Death shouldn’t have to do anyone apart!” giggles your mildly psychotic Minister of Tying Loose Ends as she finishes yet another noose. “It wouldn’t be an issue if every couple passed on at the same time! Great Creator forbid someone does die before their spouse; who would take care of them then? Give my exalted ministry the go-ahead and we’ll mandate the timely sacrifice of all newly made widows and widowers. I’m sure their posthumous reunion will be worth the early exit from this realm.”

[b][anchor=1599]#1599[/anchor]: Baby Blues [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The latest census report has shown that 65% of the babies born in @@NAME@@ last year were male. The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Obstetricians’ Union explained that many couples who come from a patriarchal family background favor boys over girls, and therefore expectant mothers overwhelmingly opt for an abortion when they find out that their child is going to be female.

The Debate
1. “This only shows that the one-child policy was a big mistake!” grumbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the vocally feminist author of [i]Why XY: Running Away With Their Tails Between Their Legs[/i]. “You see, our country is full of male supremacists who ruthlessly abort a child once they find out it is a girl! In some parts of the country, there’s the sexist assumption that boys will be able to care for their parents, while girls are thought of as a helpless burden. With only one chance, parents always choose the boy! If we abolish all restrictions on the number of kids people can have, there’ll be no need for such atrocious femicides and future families will discover the joys of precious daughters.”

2. “We’ve abandoned nature!” exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a notoriously single Luddite, replacing your desk lamp with a gas lantern. “Mother Nature grants equal boys and girls, but we’ve created missing women and excess men — a purposeless surplus, destined to be bare branches on the family tree: deprived of a partner, struggling with self-esteem, and disconnecting from society. And the issue’s obvious: nature did not intend us to know the sex of our children before they were born. Everything was meant to be a pleasant surprise. @@LEADER@@, if you ban doctors telling parents the results of prenatal ultrasound screenings, nobody will be able to abort a child because of their gender, and nature’s balance will be restored.”

3. “I can’t believe my ears!” hollers pro-life activist @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, waving around disturbing battlefield images, which @@HE@@ claims depict aborted early-term fetuses. “Why does nobody focus on the real issue here? People are having abortions for frivolous reasons. Today they abort their babies because they’re the wrong gender. Tomorrow, they’ll abort them because they don’t look photogenic in ultrasound pictures! @@LEADER@@, we should criminalize all abortions unless the fetus has a serious abnormality!”

4. “Once again, science has the answer!” ejaculates fertility expert Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, handing an oversized plastic novelty sperm to @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, who throws it away, shrieking. “Using current technology we can centrifuge human semen and separate the cells that carry X chromosomes and Y chromosomes by exploiting the difference in mass between the two. That way, we can give parents a baby of their preferred gender via IVF with a 70% success rate. Help me establish fertility clinics nationwide and these abortions will be a thing of the past. Well, in 70% of the cases. But that’s progress, right?”
