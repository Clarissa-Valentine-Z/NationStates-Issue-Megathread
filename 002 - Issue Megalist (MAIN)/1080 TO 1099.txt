[b][anchor=1080]#1080[/anchor]: The End Was Nigh [Jutsa; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
48 hours ago, Lieutenant Colonel @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Air Defence Force received a nuclear missile detection alert advising @@HIM@@ that an ICBM from the hostile nation of Blackacre was inbound for @@CAPITAL@@. According to military protocol, @@HE@@ should have reported this immediately, which would have led to a nuclear counter-strike. However, @@HE@@ suspected a false alarm, and did not alert anyone of @@HIS@@ findings until later. Subsequent investigations showed that the system had actually detected a red balloon.

The Debate
1. "@@FIRSTNAME_1@@ saved the world from apocalypse!" sings Mrs. @@LASTNAME_1@@, @@HIS_1@@ doting mother. "Had @@HE_1@@ reported this, we would all now be radioactive ash! @@HE_1@@ should be lauded as a hero, and a saviour of the world's future! Speaking of the future, you should really put more tax money into malfunction detection training and overhauling the equipment. If my little angel isn't on duty and something like this happens again, who knows what might happen?"

2. "Sure, let's reward @@HIM_1@@ for not doing @@HIS_1@@ job," sneers your Minister of Propaganda. "We'd become an international laughingstock. Instead, we must pretend this never happened, and @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ must be demoted and appropriately disciplined for breaking protocol." @@HE_2@@ leans forward to whisper in your ear. "We'll probably need to do something about @@HIS_1@@ mother, too."

3. "The fact that we're always on the verge of nuclear apocalypse is a real problem here," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pacifist author of nonfiction paperback [i]Nukes: What Are They Good For?[/i]. "We must get rid of all of our weapons of mass destruction, so we can avoid, you know, destroying the world."

4. "Hey, what idiot put a red balloon up there?" asks globophobe Willy Denbrough, who had a bad experience with a clown back in 1986. "They're a waste of helium and are just useless nasty things. If we ban balloons, we'll be sure this problem won't arise again!"

[b][anchor=1081]#1081[/anchor]: The Queen in Yellow [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
An undergraduate medical statistician has stumbled across a weird occurrence: three of the five actors involved in a theatrical piece called [i]The Queen in Yellow[/i], as well as over ten percent of the members of the opening night audience, have since received diagnoses of various psychiatric illnesses. The media have picked up on this, labelling it "the play that sends you mad", and predictably ticket sales are now skyrocketing.

The Debate
1. "I, uh..." stutters Cassilda, a former actress in the play, dismissed for 'creative differences'. "I, uh, cth... think you fh... should stop the sh... show. My dreams haven't been right since I was in the pl... play. The strange m-moon, the sh-shadows lengthen..."

2. "Selective reporting!" shouts mathematics professor Camilla Whateley. "It's like when they claimed that fighter jet pilots were having more female children, all over again. You need to learn how selection bias and basic statistics work. More to the point, the nation needs to learn how these things work. I'd suggest making stats a compulsory part of a properly funded core school curriculum. 85.7% of the seven statisticians I surveyed agree this is a good idea. The other guy, he's just an annoying smelly little..."

3. "But..." interjects an excitable stranger with a queer narrow head, a flat nose and bulgy, starry eyes. "But this is the most important theatrical production since Shoggoth on the Roof! Please accept these free tickets from us devoted fans, then personally endorse this wonderful play."

[b][anchor=1082]#1082[/anchor]: It's Hard to Separate the Truth From Entertainment [USS Monitor; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
After an election season featuring bake-offs, dance-offs, rap battles, wet T-shirt contests, and occasional sumo matches between candidates for public office, some people think politicians are spending too much time on publicity stunts and not enough time on serious debate.

The Debate
1. "They aren't just publicity stunts," claims Tulsi Haggard, a surfer and country music star who serves as a member of Congress in her spare time. "These events are an important way for candidates to show that they're in touch with regular people. In fact, we should encourage candidates to express their individuality on the campaign trail. Now would you like to hear my latest song about sales tax exemptions?"

2. "When people run for office, they should be talking about the issues, not their music career," says politician Lisbeth Burrows as she looks around your office and sketches a plan for redecorating it. "You don't see me running campaign ads about how many computers I hacked for fun or how many tattoos I have. We need more responsible election coverage and better oversight of the process before we end up with Edward Rump or Catherine Gratwick leading our country."

3. "Even if Tulsi Haggard stops parading around half-naked, Lisbeth Burrows stops talking about her fry bread recipe, and Ernie Flanders stops conducting symphonies, that won't stop voters from getting duped," sulks your Foreign Secretary, Hillary Smoochinger. "As long as elections are a popularity contest, personality politics are going to get in the way of choosing the most qualified candidates. We should just conduct surveys to find out what policies our citizens want, and you could appoint the most qualified experts to implement them. It's still democracy, except that people are recommending policies instead of voting for candidates."

4. "What do we need surveys for?" asks yogurt manufacturer and inflammatory political activist Steve Dannon. "If people aren't smart enough to see through these campaign gimmicks, they aren't smart enough to know what policies are best for the country. The fact that [i]these[/i] people are allowed in positions of power and I'm making yogurt should be all the evidence you need that democracy doesn't work. Why don't you just get rid of it? I'd be happy to give you some advice on how to run things."

The Issue
After a ring of black market fences were caught dealing in stolen goods from @@CAPITAL@@ to the rural village Noh Weir, pawn shops have fallen under scrutiny for their role in reselling illicitly-acquired wares.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, I've had it up to here with these pawn shops. They've taken it a step too far!" The flustered @@RANDOM_NAME@@ shakes @@HIS@@ fist. "They bought my TV from a criminal! Then sold it back to me! Sure, it took me a week to even notice, and only because of the smell, but that doesn't matter! They are accomplices to this crime, and I demand justice. No, I demand vengeance! No more second-hand stores!"

2. "We don't need such a drastic decision," pipes up Minister of Justice @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We just need to regulate these stores. Before any product can be sold, run these items through some police databases, and take extensive notes on the seller to crosscheck for criminal history. Sure, it will cost the taxpayers a bit, but they'll make it back with the great deals on used stereo systems."

3. Pawnbroker @@RANDOM_NAME@@ removes @@HIS@@ sunglasses. "I've been in this business my whole life, like my father before me. But now a few bad apples are giving us a bad name. If you help subsidize a television show about our hard-working salespeople, maybe we can change the public's mind. I'm sure we can meet halfway."

4. @@RANDOM_NAME@@ finally steps forward from the shadows, inviting you to kiss @@HIS@@ ringed hand. "Look, @@LEADER@@, let me be clear. This is a perfectly legitimate business. We can provide paperwork on our taxes and all. But I'd rather just give you a gift of a widescreen plasma TV. Just be careful, you might blind yourself on this picture quality. If you do, perhaps... turn that blinded eye toward our business."

[b][anchor=1084]#1084[/anchor]: How Now Kowtow? [Nuremgard; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Following an incident in which a newly appointed diplomat from a small neighbouring nation attempted to greet the monarch of @@NAME@@ with a high-five, people are questioning just how much deference should be shown to royalty.

The Debate
1. "People have forgotten how to treat their social betters," says arch-conservative courtier @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose manservant holds a pack of ravenous hounds on a leash. "Giving proper deference to our reigning sovereign is the duty of every patriotic and right-minded subject. A bow or curtsy is not enough. Citizens and visitors must demonstrate true respect by prostrating themselves on their hands and knees before the monarch in a deep kowtow. Maybe then they'll learn their place."

2. "I don't think we need to go quite that far," interjects Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, squirming away from the hounds who are showing particular interest in @@HIM@@. "I am all for giving respect to the monarch and their family, but there is no need to kowtow. With a simple bow or curtsy, people can show respect and maintain their dignity."

3. "Kowtowing? Bowing and curtsying? What century are you all in?" exclaims Prince @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, heir of the nation that caused the incident, who was recently featured in [i]Monarchy Magazine[/i]'s '40 Cool Courtiers Under 40' issue. "Why doesn't the monarchy show how with-it and relatable it is by abolishing all protocol? It'll make the sovereign of @@NAME@@ closer to the people!"

4. "Or, we could just get rid of the monarchy," suggests unconventional socialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, author of famously short manifesto [i]Simple Solutions for Troubled Times[/i]. "Then we wouldn't need to worry about how much respect to show the monarch, because there won't be one. Simple."

[b][anchor=1085]#1085[/anchor]: Nuke Before You Leap [Nation of Quebec; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
Traditionally, the leader of @@NAME@@ is the only person in the country who can authorize the use of nuclear weapons. However, the increasingly threatening rhetoric between @@NAME@@ and Blackacre, another nuclear weapons state, is making the top brass of the military concerned that the lack of checks and balances could easily trigger a nuclear war.

The Debate
1. "There needs to be more than just your authorization to launch an attack with our WMDs," asserts General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the senior commander of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ military. "It's not that we don't trust you. It's just that this Blackacre situation is giving us lots of sleepless nights. All it would take is for one insult or threat to be taken too seriously and we'd be hurled into a devastating war we may not recover from. Launches of WMDs should require the approval of the military brass plus some additional checks and confirmation codes, not just your assent. Nothing wrong with being a little cautious, is there?"

2. "Getting everyone's consent takes time, and time is a luxury we can't afford in a volatile situation," states your security adviser while drawing devil horns on a picture of Blackacre's leader. "Do you think the dictator of Blackacre is going to waste time with consultants when she decides to launch her nukes? We need to act fast in these kinds of situations. You, @@LEADER@@, need to have the ability to unilaterally declare nuclear war and launch our most powerful weapons without anyone getting in the way. Just push the big red button and Blackacre goes poof!"

3. "Or better yet, you can start dismantling those weapons!" demands your wayward niece, wearing a t-shirt with the words 'No More Torpedoes' emblazoned across the chest. "These bombs are capable of destroying Zeesh ten times over! @@NAME@@ must make a stand and take the first step towards peace. Ban weapons of mass destruction, and other brave nations will surely follow suit. I don't want my future children to inherit a post-apocalyptic @@NAME@@!"

4. "The problem here is the figurative big red button itself," muses Dr. Honey Bell-Lecter from the Institute of Thought Experimentation. "Launching nuclear weapons is an action that would definitely kill millions and could kill everyone in the world. Simply ordering a nuclear attack doesn't have enough moral cognitive weight to it. Thus, the launch codes should be stitched in the viscera of one of your loved ones. That way, you can still trigger global Armageddon if you deem it necessary, but having to first kill and disembowel your loved one makes the suffering sufficiently real for you and forces you to confront the ethical consequences of your actions."

[b][anchor=1086]#1086[/anchor]: Fun in the Sun [Baggieland; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
Neighbouring Bigtopia has gone on a tourism promotion overdrive, with spectacular advertising that is bound to attract visitors in their droves. Worried by the likely fall in foreign arrivals, your Tourism Minister has suggested an area of @@NAME@@ be marked for development. However, what area should be selected and what type of activities should be promoted?

The Debate
1. Oi guv'nor, what them tourists want is to feast their peepers on real life, with real people," suggests 'Acksaw 'Arry, a colourful gent, who has an equally colourful association with the law. "Spend a few bob building up the working-class areas of @@CAPITAL@@. We'll take them tourists round our gaffs, get their laughing gear round a few Dame Ednas, and have a knees-up round the ol' Joanna." One of your aides, who is from that area of @@CAPTIAL@@, translates: "He said that the tourists should experience traditional home hospitality, with beverages and a sing-a-long."

2. "One proposes that you send those tourists to one's stately home," opines Rubert Holdsworth-Wellington, an eminent member of @@CAPITAL@@'s old money. "There's acres of room, literally. There will be fine dining available throughout their stay and for entertainment they may savour some outdoor pursuits. For example: one's two-acre maze, horse-riding and of course, learning the skill of hedge artistry. Just pay one a stipend for allowing those riff-raff into one's home."

[3]. "G'day mate! Send 'em tourists down to the beach," declares Sheila Billabong, as she hands her surfboard to your Tourism Minister. "We'll show them how a true-blue @@DEMONYM@@ lives life in the sun. We just need you gumument fellas to put shark nets all over the place; then those tourists will be riding waves in no time!" [[color=purple]Must not have a trash environment[/color]]

[4]. "Y'all shouldn't listen to those guys; they're all hat and no cattle!" states Chuck Butch III, whose riding spurs barely fit through your door. "Send those tourists to my ranch; there ain't nothin' bigger or better. We'll show them how to herd cattle, use a lasso, and treat them to the biggest darn steak they've ever seen! With a bit of extra moolah from the gov'ment, I'll set up a rodeo. Yee-haa!" [[color=blue]Must not be vegetarian[/color]]

5. "Yodel-lay-ee-dee," exclaims Frau Helga Krapps, who is trying to set a new fashion statement with her pinny. "Ze tourists vould be much better coming to my ski resort in der Alpen region of @@NAME@@. They can stay in mein beautiful chalets overlooking ze pistes. Ve have skiing, snowboarding und sledging for ze little munchkins. I just vant ze government to let us put artificial snow on the slopes for drier seasons. Danke!"

6. "Hey man, we should, like, promote sustainable ecotourism," insists Dylan, a tatty looking fellow who you swear just had a small creature rummaging around in his beard. "Our countryside is pretty cool, @@LEADER@@. The government should make laws to protect our forests and rivers, then those tourist dudes will come in swarms to marvel at Mother Nature's creations man!"

7. "Get off my property!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is rumoured to be the grumpiest @@MAN@@ in all of @@NAME@@. "I don't want no tourists coming over here and having fun, especially near me. Hey, you tourists! No fun, do you hear? Folks used to be able to have fun 'round here, then some tourists came along and started having some fun - ruined it for everyone. Tell them tourists they're not welcome here!"

[b][anchor=1087]#1087[/anchor]: An International Dictatorial Dilemma [Chan Island; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The Despojanbourg Republic is a tiny but strategically located mountainous country that has long been in your nation's repertoire of allies, despite its reputation for below-average human rights. The authoritarian, fiercely pro-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ government is a linchpin of regional security. However, a recent series of enormous protests calling for "real democracy" and "new leadership" has shaken its stability to the core.

The Debate
1. "You can't let our friends go down if you can help it," explains strategic analyst @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who almost looks like a different person every time you see him. "Despojanbourg has helped us eliminate countless terrorist cells and apprehend many other criminals. They have scratched our backs so much, it's time we scratched theirs. I recommend sending a military expeditionary force to crack down on the protests and help them root out dissidents. It'll probably look bad in the press, but we have to stay safe."

2. "You're right, it will look awful in the press," notes your rarely seen Minister of Whispers after entering the room through a concealed passage under the floorboards. "That's why we need to be much more subtle about this. Instead of soldiers, send in operatives to assist their secret police, diplomats who will promise to negotiate changes - without actually doing anything, and 'election observers' to come up with even more creative ways of rigging their upcoming sham elections. Nobody will ever know a thing."

3. "Why are we propping up a failing dictator?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your more idealistic and hot-headed advisors. "Just because they were nice to us one or a hundred times? No, declare your support for the coming revolution. Call for real, free, and fair elections! These people deserve a government that isn't hopelessly corrupt. I'm sure the members of their current administration will receive a fair trial... as long as they're not beaten to death by angry mobs first."

[4]. "You're partially correct," notes Major General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who reportedly uses a level to ensure that @@HIS@@ haircut is perfectly flat. "The people of Despojanbourg absolutely have a right to democracy, but our people also have a right to stay safe. Therefore, the solution is obvious: let them have their new government, but inform the new administration that we'll end all military and economic assistance unless they allow us to convert some of their land into @@DEMONYM@@ military bases. Sure, they might complain about 'sovereignty', but sovereignty doesn't stop Maxtopian-inspired terrorists. We do." [[color=purple]Must supply foreign aid[/color]]

The Issue
Scandalously, a recent TV interview revealed that your Minister for Public Health doesn't know much about being healthy. @@HE_1@@ didn't know the difference between a bacterium and a virus, and thought that Ebola was the name of a Bigtopian princess.

The Debate
1. Director of Communications Malcolm Capaldi has had a very busy day shouting at his inferiors, but makes some time to shout at you. "Right, that is it! I've had enough of politicians with no experience or knowledge of their department's aegis. It's about as useful as asking a brain surgeon to climb a tree! What's next? An Environmental Advisor who doesn't believe in climate change? I say we need properly qualified professionals leading their departments. A doctor caring for the health service, a teacher in charge of education, and so on. In fact, there should be a mandatory examination paper that you have to pass to hold a government position. No more idiot politicians, please!"

2. Much to everyone's surprise, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, the shamed Public Health Minister, squeezes in through your window, having climbed a tree to your floor. "Whew... I think I've evaded those journalists! I agree that we must ensure this doesn't happen again. We ministers should be better supported in our appointments; we can only be as good as our briefings! A proper team of aides and analysts for all officials will ensure we don't get caught out again, even if it increases administrative costs. Oh, by the way, in case anyone asks you, it turns out Ebola is a type of disease!"

[3]. Rummaging through your desk for valuables, an uninvited burglar decides to comment. "If I may speak for us decent working folk, I can honestly only name one or two ministers in your Cabinet. Why? Because we, the people, didn't elect them. No one in government should be doing a job unless the public chose them for it. We must hold elections for all ministerial posts. There's only like six of them, aren't there?" [[color=blue]Must be democratic[/color]]

4. Your mother walks in with a tray of freshly baked cookies for everyone. "I don't know about all these big ideas; the problem is quite simple. Only you know how you want to run this country. It's all well and good having friends to help but I'm not sure they actually do anything. Surely you can do it all yourself, little darling; you shouldn't let anyone question your decisions or your absolute rule. Any spare politicians that won't bow out gracefully you should get rid of. Just give them a poisoned cookie or something." She smiles innocently as your Public Health Minister desperately spits out a mouthful of crumbs.

[b][anchor=1089]#1089[/anchor]: Woman Trouble [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Since you reaffirmed your government's opposition to female suffrage, a band of highly militant suffragettes have been causing trouble in @@CAPITAL@@, inflicting criminal damage on property and even employing violence against policemen.

The Debate
1. "Pah! This women's rights rubbish is all piffle and poppycock!" boos Henry Hasquith, your Minister of Misogyny and author of the scientifically dubious pamphlet [i]Women Have Squirrel Brains, and 999 Other Facts[/i]. "Women lack the temperament for politics, and they are more than adequately represented at the ballot by their fathers and husbands. If women stepped into this masculine sphere, nature would be destroyed; women would lose their sweetness and become masculinised. Suffragettes are palpably and demonstrably clinically insane. Lock these poor souls in an asylum, for compassion's sake, and give them every treatment to cure them of their morbid hysterias."

2. "I'd caution underestimating the so-called weaker sex," warns special branch police chief Brendon Steed. "These terrorist suffragettes are not ill; they are seditious criminals. They don't need to be rehabilitated, they need to be defeated! The very fabric of social order is at risk here - give me and my men the resources and permission to do what is needed, and we will break the back of this rebellion." He slaps a truncheon into a leather-gloved hand. "Literally."

3. "We have to face facts: these women aren't going away," mutters your pragmatic Minister of Solutions. "Maybe we should give them a little of what they think they want. Limited women's suffrage isn't going to hurt us, if we're careful about not giving them any real power. It's not like they'll use it, anyway. After all, some women have worked in trusted roles in @@NAME@@ for many years. But we shouldn't go around, implying suffrage is a right, regardless of stability or status. How about we grant women over thirty the vote, as long as they hold property, and pass an intelligence test that demonstrates they intend to vote for the right party? Surely that's a fair solution that everyone can live with."

*4. "This disparity cannot stand," shouts suffragette Christine Pankhurst, bursting into the room and hurling a Votes for Women banner at you. "For the laws we obey, for the taxes we pay, we demand our right to have a say! This deplorable oppression has forced us to do that which we would never do: break the law so that our own government will finally hear us! Yes, some commercial premises might have had their windows broken; some mail boxes may have been blown-up. But only by striking at @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ enterprise could we get you to listen. We were driven to desperation by your constant disregard of our plight. We are not law-breakers; we wish to be law-makers. And it is incumbent on you, @@LEADER@@, to give us the vote and a chance."

[b][anchor=1090]#1090[/anchor]:  I Ain't Afraid of No Girls [The Free Joy State; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
The all-female remake of the cult camp comedy film [i]Ghost-Smashers[/i] is the latest in a string of controversial female reboots of beloved media franchises. This trend has not gone unnoticed by the blogosphere, which has been alight with uneven reviews, some applause and thirty-page dissections of each line.

The Debate
1. "This is a desecration of a classic," reads a rant from the blog of InternetGenius72, who boasts in his bio that he is forty-five and can quote every line of the original [i]Ghost-Smashers[/i] backwards.  "The original wasn't about four chicks; it was about four [i]dudes[/i], okay?  Four dudes with cool shades and boilersuits and short-wave sonic matter-busters.  Now, they've turned it into four chicks, with [i]families[/i] and [i]feelings[/i] and they replaced the matter-buster with an ionising particle-blaster.  What's next?  The maverick cop movie [i]Dirty Harold[/i] remade as [i]Dirty Harriet[/i]?  I'm not a sexist or anything, but I want people to stop tampering with the classics.  Filmmakers should make something new — remakes and sequels always suck."

2. "The female-led reimagining of the iconic [i]Ghost-Smashers[/i] is one small step to placing women in the driving seat of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ cinema, and I say it's about bloody time!" shouts the host of feminist panel-show [i]HERstory[/i], looking nonplussed when people in the room don't cheer.  "@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ media has traditionally portrayed manhood as strong and powerful, while womanhood is depicted as the sweet and subservient helpmeet.  Well, I say we promote media that show men being sweet and women being the tough leaders of tomorrow they were born to be.  Can I get a whoop-whoop?"

3. Your computer pings with a message: "My name is @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, and I represent The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Kings, which aims to rebalance the power between men and these hussies.  First, they got the vote, but that wasn't enough.  Now they ruin our movies, looking without shame down camera lenses and swearing and flirting with men who don't even deserve a woman.  All while taking great parts from good men who would've been great actors.  It's time you put these uppity slatterns back in their place.  Ban womenfolk from playing any role that doesn't portray modest, sweet and submissive ladylike behaviour.  P.S. Porn is fine."

4. "All these people are crazy," mutters @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Film Appreciation Society.  "Nevertheless, it has to be said that there has been something of a dearth of quality parts for women and minorities.  And this [i]Ghoulie-Hitters[/i] — is that right? — hardly seems to redress the balance with its gaudy effects and lack of nuanced characterisation.  We must fund high-quality films that provide meaningful and intelligent roles depicting the trials of three-dimensional @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ men and women of all backgrounds.  Loud whizz-bang effects may be more attention-getting, but it's the stories and the people that truly matter."

The Issue
Due to a mix-up at the border, a number of immigrants have been sent backward, downward, upward and sideways to various detention centres across @@NAME@@. In the midst of the confusion, several thousand children have been separated from their parents.

The Debate
1. "Look, these migrants have [i]clearly[/i] violated the law! Clearly!" says your Head of Immigration @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ closely inspects the stamps on your passport. "Not only did they cross the border [i]illegally[/i], but then they have the gall to ask for citizenship. Sure, the children may not enjoy being separated from their parents, but that's what they get for breaking the law! If it was national policy for illegal immigrants to be treated as the criminals they are, to have their kids taken away, far fewer of them would come to our country. Guaranteed." @@HE@@ runs out of your office to pursue a worker with a Marche Noirian accent.

2. "Seriously?" gasps @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, who just got out of her latest therapy session with her eight-year-old child. "Look at my little @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@. @@HE@@ was separated from me at the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ border, taken away the moment I asked for asylum. @@HE@@ spent so many months in that state facility that @@HE@@ can hardly talk in Bigtopian, and @@HE@@ keeps trying to arrest the other young children in the playground!

"Separating children from parents? Putting immigrants in jail? Deporting migrants back to the wrong country?

1. "These children are a potential source of danger!" says death camp survivor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Think what would happen if one of them rose to power in @@NAME@@ and repeated Terallihitlah's crimes here. They have to be put under surveillance to make sure that never happens. And if they turn out not to be as evil, then we ought to be monitoring them to protect them from those with a misplaced sense of vengeance against them. Either way, everybody is safest if we keep a close watch."

2. "That's not enough!" yells Bigtopian human rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What if someone marries them without knowing? What if they have kids? Terallihitlah systematically murdered millions of Bigtopians because he believed we were genetically inferior. We can't allow his DNA to stay in the gene pool! These abominations must die!"

3. "What is wrong with you people?" civil rights lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ wants to know. "Don't we have anything better to do than judge people by their DNA? These children aren't Lee Terallihitlah and they haven't done anything wrong. It should be illegal to discriminate against people based on their genes."

4. "Hey, like, maybe we can use this," says controversial pop singer Britney Speer, as she bounces into your office dressed in a bizarre mix of sequins, body paint, and fascist regalia. "You can recruit the clones to work for you and have them travel the country promoting patriotism. What could possibly go wrong?"

[b][anchor=1093]#1093[/anchor]: Ignorance is No Excuse? [Matroyska; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
After a widely followed trial in which an ordinary citizen was prosecuted for tax evasion, insurance fraud, and serial jaywalking due to small legislative changes that were only implemented the previous month, many are questioning how changes in the law should be communicated to the general public.

The Debate
1. "It's not my fault I broke these idiotic new laws if I wasn't even aware they existed! How was I supposed to know that claiming my seven cats as dependents for tax purposes was no longer legal?" protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was recently convicted and is awaiting sentencing. "Every time new laws are put in place, there should be a two-month grace period before they can be enforced. Furthermore, to make sure each citizen is aware of the changes, the government should send regular updates on new legislation to every registered address in @@NAME@@. It's the only way to stop travesties like this from happening again!"

*2. "Nobody sends letters any more; what are you, a square?" taunts spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from Webflix, one of the largest digital streaming services. "Everyone gets their information from the internet now. Just incentivize all of the streaming services to regularly provide updates on new legislation. In fact, we could have our own show, hosted by celebrities like what's-@@HIS_1@@-name, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, and maybe even @@RANDOM_NAME@@. The people will love it! Everyone will want to watch @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Law News Forum on demand!" [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

*3. Nobody sends letters any more; what are you, a square?" taunts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the managing director of the @@ANIMAL@@ News Channel. "Everyone watches TV now. Just incentivize all channels to regularly show updates on new legislation. In fact, we could have our own weekly show, hosted by celebrities like what's-@@HIS_1@@-name, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, and maybe even @@RANDOM_NAME@@. The people will love it, tuning in every week to watch @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Law News Live!" [[color=red]Must not have internet[/color]]

4. "Why should the taxpayer fork out for information no one uses, or allow grace periods for corrupt people to repeatedly break laws and plead ignorance?" asks devoted penny-scrimper @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who appears to have helped @@HIM@@self to the entire contents of the candy dish in the lobby. "If someone wants to know something, they should have to find it out at their own expense by doing their own research. If that's too much effort for the couch-potato youths of today, then they'll just have to risk the legal consequences of their misguided actions!"

[b][anchor=1094]#1094[/anchor]: A Political Cover-Up [Jutsa; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
A complication arose yesterday when three ambassadors from the conservative nation of Althaniq had a meeting in @@NAME@@, only to find themselves surrounded by a bunch of naked diplomats.

The Debate
1. "You must do something about this outrageous impropriety!" exclaims Ambassador Myron Jakeem, trying his best not to look at you. "Your custom of nudism may be fine for you, but it's completely unacceptable in our culture. I beg of you to allow your people to wear proper clothing during international meetings - for the sake of human decency."

2. "Look, I'm not saying that everybody is a pretty sight," begins @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ diplomat @@RANDOM_NAME@@, making no effort to cover the more pendulous parts of @@HIM@@self. "But why should we pander to their culture? If anything, they should be showing respect for our ways. They need to loosen up: we should force them to disrobe when they come here. Once they've experienced the freedom of nudity, they'll appreciate how liberating it is!"

3. "Or, you know, you could just put some clothes on everyone," suggests your mom, as she hides her modesty behind the drapes. "It's not only diplomats who are finding this lack of a limitation restrictive! I honestly don't know where to look while I'm talking to your grandparents, frying food is downright painful, and don't even get me started on trying to go for a morning run. You must put an end to compulsory nudity!"

[b][anchor=1095]#1095[/anchor]: Make The Cut [Australian rePublic; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
When the grass on a roadside patch of lawn in front of @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@'s house grew so long that a herd of wild deer moved in, the local council tried to force @@HIM@@ to mow it - a job @@HE@@ claims is not @@HIS@@ to do. Unexpectedly, this all-out turf war escalated over several months, till finally the problem has found itself on your doorstep.

The Debate
1. "It's a bloody outrage, it is!" complains @@RNAME_1@@, who has showed up wearing nothing but a grubby string vest and stained briefs that have seen better days. "Some whinging council nerd says it was me land to mow and I gotta mows it! So then I told 'em since it was me land, I can do whats I wants with it. Then they tell me it's their land, but I gotta mows it. Anyways, I tells 'em: if it ain't me land, then it ain't me bloody problem to mow the land, is it? If they want it mowed, they can bleedin' mow it themselves!"

2. "Surely you can't expect us to look after every nature strip in our local government area?" asks Councillor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving the red-ink-covered printout of the Local Authority's annual budget. "By the time we pick up litter and pull weeds, we'll need to be doubling our council rates! And when we do increase our rates, everyone chucks a stink! Force the idling bludgers to be socially responsible for once in their lives, and get them mowing!"

3. "The whole problem appears to be that it's not the resident's land," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Creative Solutions. "So what if we were to change that? Expand land rights out from the front door to the road. Homeowners get a land windfall, local authorities get to devolve responsibility. What could possibly go wrong?"

4. "Hard problems need hard solutions," observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, manager of ConcreteIsUs. "Why don't we just pave over the damned nature strip? That way it won't matter whose land it is as no one will have to mow it."

The Issue
Upon allowing @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ to vote, it has come to light that elements in society are training large teams of them to vote for specific candidates and causes. With hordes of @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ forming an orderly line outside a nearby polling station, you decide to listen to a group of fervent bystanders.

The Debate
1. "Take a good, hard look at what we have become," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who, along with @@HIS@@ friends and family, have supported the same political party for decades. "Are you telling me it's a coincidence that their voting patterns are virtually identical? That they all willingly would vote against their own interest, like supporting candidates deep in the pockets of the agricultural-industrial complex? I'm telling you, animal-whispering yahoos are allowed to vote tens, even hundreds, of times through their 'associates'. It's unfair, and it's voter fraud. Clearly, we need to forbid @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ from voting."

2. "Don't say that around Mr. Puffles," lectures Mama @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, covering her pet's ears with a crochet scarf. "If @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ are being manipulated to vote a certain way, we need to find and crack down on those trying to abuse the system. In addition, you should install an unbiased program to teach @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ how to resist this kind of conditioning, allowing them to vote freely, of their own mind."

3. "With @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ this was bound to happen," whispers Milo Cesar in a Wezeltonian accent, while asserting his dominance over Mr. Puffles. "They are intelligent, yes, but crave leadership. It is only natural that they seek guidance. The real question is, who is best fitted to guide them? Perhaps it is you? My rates are very reasonable, and with discipline and affection - in that order - I will make you the leader of the greatest pack @@NAME@@ has ever seen."

[b][anchor=1097]#1097[/anchor]: What Do We Do With a Drunken Sailor? [Caracasus; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ navy has always allowed shore leave when docked at ports in the tiny allied nation of Prudenlund. However, after a brawl involving two hundred rowdy @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ sailors in Prudenlund's quiet city streets made international news, the admiralty has begun exploring ways to repair its image.

The Debate
1. "This... this is disgraceful!" states red-faced Rear Admiral @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "These sailors are acting like common hooligans! I say we round them up, court martial the ringleaders and forbid all shore leave for the foreseeable future. Our reputation is at stake here."

2. "It's not shore leave that's the problem here, it's the devil's nectar!" notes dour-faced Warrant Officer @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "Let our sailors have their shore leave, but forbid them from drinking. We'll just breathalyze them on their way back to the ship. As for any that fail... well, we can always break the old cat o' nine tails out of the naval history museum."

3. "A drop of @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@'s Blood never done us any harm!" chants Bosun's Mate @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, swaying slightly from side to side. "Getting hamm... er, drinking on shore leave is a sailor's right from time immemorial! Those stuck up Prudenlundians wouldn't know a good time if it smacked them round the head with a bottle! If they're so opposed to our lot enjoying themselves - then our ships should just avoid their ports and maybe we should stop trading with them too. That'll learn'em!"

4. "Now... now wait here just a minute..." slurs a queasy cadet who appears to have gatecrashed the meeting. "I've been talking to my mates, right... and we don't wanna be in the navy any more. We might have to kill people and that's kind of a downer... but on the bright side, we throw the best parties! Say, that's a thought - let's get rid of the whole navy nonsense and open up our warships for party cruises!"

[b][anchor=1098]#1098[/anchor]: Edged Out [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive] [/b]

The Issue
Banning guns has reduced gun crime, but in its place knife crime is rising. A recent anonymous survey of teenagers suggests that a frighteningly high proportion of them carry a blade routinely.

The Debate
1. "My son was stabbed three times," weeps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, parent of a hospitalised teenager, "all because he looked at someone the wrong way. Well, yes, and spat in the girl's face. Sure, and he poked her once or twice with his finger... look, that's not the point! We have to ban concealed weapons of any sort!"

2. "A knife is a vital tool!" exclaims outdoorsman @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, using his Bowie knife to peel a banana. "Responsible adults like me shouldn't be punished! Just ban blade ownership till the age of majority; let grown-ups carry whatever blades they need to. Ouch!" He yelps as he nicks his finger.

3. "Tribes in the Kawandaland jungle give children knives to play with as soon as they can walk," observes hippy mum @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, handing her six-year-old son a bottle of bleach for his household chores. "Maybe if we trusted our children more, they'd learn responsibility at an early age. I say that every child should be encouraged to keep a knife on them, and taught to use it for creative purposes, like whittling or splint basketry."

4. "I can't believe one is reduced to this; I'm frankly dying of embarrassment here, old chap," mumbles @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, an adolescent highwayman waving a silver butter-knife at you as he tries to mug you. "How is any self-respecting criminal meant to be taken seriously these days? For the sake of our national dignity, my dear bureaucrat, you must allow us to have our firearms back! Also, give me your valuables, or I'll slice your gizzard."

[b][anchor=1099]#1099[/anchor]: New Satellite Blues [Ransium; ed: Pogaria] [/b]

The Issue
The @@NAME@@ Aeronautics and Space Administration (@@NAME_INITIALS@@ASA) is currently reviewing proposals for a new flagship satellite project. Debates about the merits of each plan have become so intense that a recent fight resulted in thousands of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in damage to pocket protectors, calculators, and glasses. Agency heads have therefore deferred to you to decide which project should be chosen.

The Debate
1. "This isn't rocket science!" states @@NAME_INITIALS@@ASA astronomer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@HIS@@ bow tie still ruffed and @@HIS@@ glasses askew from the recent funding fight. "@@NAME_INITIALS@@ASA needs to create wonder in the young and old alike, while also performing cutting-edge science. My proposed space telescope, Bubble, is the ideal tool for this. Think of what pictures it could take: supernovas in the process of erupting, crystal-clear images of nebulas on the shoulders of Orion, C-class stars glittering near Tannhäuser Galaxy. Without Bubble, all these moments will be lost, like tears in the rain."

2. "I find my colleague's position to be myopic and self-serving," declares remote sensing specialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is sporting a black eye and torn suspenders. "Who cares what's happening a million light-years away? Our real problems are much more local. Right now, man is causing rapid changes to the surface of our planet, endangering major ecosystems. The best way to understand these changes is from space. My proposed LANDSPOT satellite will be equipped with cutting-edge tools such as hyperspectral imaging and advanced LIDAR, giving us a whole new perspective on this little blue marble we call home."

*3. "Space may hold a terrible secret!" warns asteroid hunter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while rubbing @@HIS@@ knuckles. "Do you remember what happened to the dinosaurs? If we don't want to share the same fate, then the first step is arming ourselves with knowledge. My proposed Guardian satellite is specially designed to find and track the orbits of all potentially dangerous near-Earth objects. If we find something, we'll take the second step: arming ourselves against the asteroid by implementing my Star Battles missile shield project." [[color=purple]Must not have dinosaurs[/color]]

*4. "Space may hold a terrible secret!" warns asteroid hunter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while rubbing @@HIS@@ knuckles. "Do you remember what happened to the dinosaurs? I mean, before we brought them back? If we don't want to share the same fate, then the first step is arming ourselves with knowledge. My proposed Guardian satellite is specially designed to find and track the orbits of all potentially dangerous near-Earth objects. If we find something, we'll take the second step: arming ourselves against the asteroid by implementing my Star Battles missile shield project." [[color=purple]Must have dinosaurs[/color]]

**[5]."You think your average @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ on the street is going to care about any of those things?" asks the stylishly dressed CEO of Horizon Communications. "Doubtful. Now, tell them they'll be able to load a WhoTube video from their phone a whole second faster and I promise you they'll be interested. @@NAME_INITIALS@@ASA and Horizon must partner to create the most cutting-edge communications satellite the world has ever seen.

[[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]; [color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

7. "Don't listen to their lies!" whispers a wild-eyed stranger, while sneaking past your security. "The entire @@NAME_INITIALS@@ASA is actually conducting a program to broadcast subliminal messages straight into citizens' brains. I've been listening to their secret transmissions through my teeth fillings. They're playing you for a sucker, I tell ya! You must remove all funding from @@NAME_INITIALS@@ASA and divert it to things that do demonstrable good, like mental health services. I hear there are people out there that really need help."
