[b][anchor=1381]#1381[/anchor]: Chairman No [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
You have called for a meeting in an attempt to resolve “the missile situation” without resorting to violence.

The Issue
East Lebatuck and San Vitenzo have accepted your request for a diplomatic summit. After a brief flight, you have arrived in Granfalloon, the dusty and impoverished capital city of San Vitenzo. Several dignitaries are already waiting to speak with you.

The Debate
1. “Ah, the capitalist pigs have arrived!” smirks East Lebatuckese Chairman Joseph Rushev, who was handing out hammer-and-sickle pins to the local residents. “The proud workers of San Vitenzo are tired of putting up with imperialist harassment. Stationing our nuclear weapons here liberates them from the threat of outside interference. With our support and protection, San Vitenzo can divert funding from their military to schools, roads, and other infrastructure. Now kindly remove yourselves from this island before you get into any trouble — and try to improve the welfare of your own downtrodden citizens before casting any more aspersions upon our brave comrades.”

2. TBD

3. “Let’s not start off on the wrong foot,” calls out San Vitenzo’s sandal-clad President for Life, “Doc” Moreno, as he walks up to you and pulls you aside. “The hard-working people of our nation need protection from the imperialists of the world who would take advantage of us... like you, perhaps. However, these nuclear missiles have just turned us into a target. What if you and Rushev were to each remove some of your weapons that were near the other party’s borders? If your missiles in Smalltopia were to disappear, I think I could talk Rushev into removing all of his missiles from this island. Now... while you’re here, have you ever heard of boko-maru?” He looks at your feet and removes a tape measure from his pocket.

4. As you are about to return to your hotel room, a young woman approaches you and starts speaking rapidly. “Excuse me! My name is Ramona Moreno — President Moreno is my father. Papa is too proud to admit it, but our people are starving. Since he’ll never ask for it directly, I will: we need massive amounts of food and medical aid. The East Lebatuckese don’t care about our people; they’re just exploiting us for our resources and taking advantage of our location in case they need to launch missiles at @@NAME@@. Without your assistance, we’ll quickly end up as another impoverished, powerless satellite state within East Lebatuck’s Socialist Pact. Please negotiate a missile removal plan with my father — and then send us as much aid as you can afford.”

[b][anchor=1383]#1383[/anchor]: You Only Negotiate Twice [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
You agreed to remove your missiles from Smalltopia in exchange for East Lebatuck removing their missiles from San Vitenzo.

The Issue
After a series of secret negotiations, everyone has shaken hands and made a commitment to disarm. You and an aide have met with Chairman Joseph Rushev in a beautiful glass-fronted conference room in San Vitenzo to sign the final agreement.

The Debate
1. TBD

2. “Good morning! Are you ready to make history? Let me just get my ceremonial signing pen.” Rushev reaches into his coat pocket and removes not a pen, but a Maxarov pistol, which he points directly at your chest. “Have you noticed that world leaders like ourselves never get frisked for weapons? I can’t remember the last time I had to go through a metal detector. Seems like a security flaw, don’t you think? Well, I digress. I hope you didn’t actually expect me to remove my own missiles. You see, I didn’t get to be Chairman of East Lebatuck by giving up power every time I had a disagreement with someone. Real leaders do whatever it takes to seize power and claw our way to the top. Of course, I hope you understand that this isn’t personal — it’s just politics. As soon as you’re dead...” Suddenly, the window shatters as James Bont crashes into the room in a hail of glass fragments, closely followed by his a Rainbow Pony flag parachute. Bont quickly fires a miniature grappling hook from his wristwatch, which latches onto Rushev’s pistol and pulls it out of his hand. “I hope you don’t mind me dropping in, boss. Your aide pressed the panic button — and I see that mister Commie in Chief is up to his old tricks. Well, here’s how it’s going to go, Rushev. I secretly removed a warhead from one of your nuclear missiles and handed it off to one of my colleagues in East Lebatuck. He has hidden it in your capital city, ready for detonation at a moment’s notice. Either you sign that agreement and follow through with each of its terms, which include some generous financial aid for San Vitenzo, or your ‘glorious worker’s paradise’ is going to be a victim of your own hubris. Are we clear?” Rushev nods and quickly scribbles his name on the agreement. “Good. Now get out of here and don’t threaten @@NAME@@ ever again, or your capital will become a radioactive crater faster than you can say ‘Marxist class struggle’.” Bont turns toward you as Rushev and his aide scurry out of the room. “Let’s go home, shall we?”

[b][anchor=1385]#1385[/anchor]: Skycrash [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
You sent bombers to attack East Lebatuck’s missile sites.

The Issue
Your brave pilots made a valiant effort to take out the missile installations on San Vitenzo. Unfortunately, the enemy was prepared for this scenario. The @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ bombers were harassed by enemy anti-aircraft fire from the moment they entered San Vitenzan airspace. Your military analysts are now reporting that one of the aircraft has been shot down, and the pilot was captured.

The Debate
1. “What a disaster!” shouts Defense Minister Mack Rimera, now drinking directly from his unmarked flask. “Not only were our bombers unable to complete their mission, but they’re probably torturing that pilot as we speak! At least he reportedly put up a good fight before they were able to capture him. Well, screw it. We’re out of options. We must launch a full invasion of San Vitenzo.”

2. “Do you always let your... pistol do your thinking for you?” replies Maureen Dusk, whose guitar is uncharacteristically silent. “What if we were to offer a prisoner swap? We still have that East Lebatuckese spy we found wandering in the shopping district of The First Congratulatory Union City a while back. He didn’t seem to know much about anything, so it wouldn’t be a great loss. Let’s offer to trade him for our pilot. If we act fast enough, they might not be able to extract any classified military secrets.”

3. Before anyone else can speak, your rarely seen Minister of Mass Destruction, Dr. Helix Fenniker, climbs down a rope ladder that has just descended from the ceiling. “I couldn’t help overhearing that we have a belligerent enemy and a captured pilot. Allow me to introduce ‘ICE-X’ — my lab’s solution to both of those problems. This breakthrough bio-weapon destroys cell walls via a rapid crystallization process. Deployment is easy — we’ve already loaded the canisters into some modified cruise missiles. Our warships can fire them at the enemy bases with impunity! Of course, any ‘innocent’ civilians or animals that are exposed to the residue will experience catastrophic organ failure. But look on the bright side! Our pilot won’t be able to divulge any secrets, and most of the enemy troops will be eliminated!”

[b][anchor=1388]#1388[/anchor]: Tomorrow Never Arrives [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
You have ordered an attack on East Lebatuck’s military bases in San Vitenzo.

The Issue
The enemy’s soldiers have suffered overwhelming casualties, thanks to your advanced military technology. Unfortunately, East Lebatuck seems to have interpreted your actions as an unforgivable assault upon their nation and its allies. Moments ago, all of the nuclear missiles on San Vitenzo were launched and appear to be headed at targets throughout The First Congratulatory Union.

The Debate
1. “HOLY VIOLET! GET TO THE BUNKER! RUN!” A flood of screaming people push you downstairs and through a long hallway, stumbling into the fallout shelter beneath your office. The door clanks shut as the last staff members sprint through the reinforced threshold. Your defense minister shambles over towards you, head in hands. “Well, we’re screwed. @@CAPITAL@@ is finished. I’m not even sure this bunker can withstand a direct hit. On the bright side, our own nuclear missiles are ready for launch. Which of East Lebatuck’s cities do you hate the most?” A nervous guffaw escapes from his lips.

2. “No... we can’t do that to the poor folks,” murmurs Maureen Dusk, devoid of guitar, her voice barely above a whisper. “East Lebatuck is filled with people like us. The oppressed, freedom-loving consumers won’t ever have a chance to rise up and overthrow the communist government if we wipe them from existence. Don’t retaliate, @@LEADER@@. The violence has to stop somewhere. By the way, it was an honor serving with you.” A single teardrop runs down her face.

--------------------------------------------------------------
[b][anchor=1389]#1389[/anchor]: Die Some Other Day [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
You and your staff are huddled into an underground bunker, waiting for the end to come.

The Issue
The minutes pass in relative silence. Occasionally, the stillness is punctuated by a sniffle or a whimper that seems amplified in the confined space. A few distant rumbles can be heard, but nothing that sounds like the expected obliteration of everyone’s hopes and dreams. Suddenly, Defense Minister Mack Rimera’s voice cuts through the rising tide of whispered conversations: “What the hell? Chief, we’ve got an incoming call.”

The Debate
3. Rimera ushers you over to a nearby phone, where a red light is blinking. He presses a few buttons to put the call on speakerphone. “@@LEADER@@? Is that you?” The static-obscured voice of James Bont is barely audible, causing Rimera to frantically increase the volume. “I was able to infiltrate the enemy’s bases by posing as a technician. The whole operation here is being run by a rather boorish fellow by the name of General Stuppa. As the diplomatic conflict intensified, Stuppa was constantly arguing with Colonel Sinwat, his second in command. General Stuppa kept shouting that @@NAME@@ was a threat that needed to be taken out preemptively. Even after some sort of attack by our military, Colonel Sinwat wouldn’t support any retaliation that would lead to mutually assured destruction. General Stuppa accused his officer of treason, pulled out his sidearm, and shot him in the head, then took his nuclear launch key. Stuppa and the remaining officers immediately launched all of the ballistic missiles straight at @@NAME@@. Fortunately... I had already disarmed each of the warheads.” Bont’s closing words are obscured by a deafening cheer from the people surrounding you.

[b][anchor=1390]#1390[/anchor]: Spectrum of Solace [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
The enemy’s nuclear weapons failed to detonate due to the courageous actions of your secret agent.

The Issue
Although East Lebatuck remains angry with you due to recent events, they have insisted that they did not intend for things to escalate this far. As an apology for this sobering occurrence, their contrite government has arranged peace talks in an attempt to defuse the situation.

The Debate
1. “I’d like to personally apologize for the... um... missile incident,” admits Chairman Joseph Rushev of East Lebatuck, looking more sheepish than you have ever seen him. “General Stuppa was definitely not authorized to initiate a nuclear strike or take any action that would result in our mutually assured destruction. He and his officers have been relieved of duty... permanently. As a token of our goodwill, your pilot who was shot down and your agent who managed to infiltrate our military bases will be returned to @@NAME@@ unharmed. If you are willing to sign a non-aggression treaty and pay reparations for the brave warriors of communism who were needlessly killed, I think we can put this whole unpleasant situation behind us. What do you say?”

2. TBD

3. “Sure, go ahead and sign their treaty, but it’s not enough,” sighs Maureen Dusk, who is softly playing ‘Sweet Home @@CAPITAL@@’ on her guitar. “This incident clearly proves that weapons of mass destruction can no longer be allowed to exist. I spoke with my counterpart in East Lebatuck, and it appears that they are also willing to disarm if we do the same. It’s a bold move, but I think you’re the sort of brave visionary who can lead us into a new era of peace, free from the scourge of WMDs.”

4. “You’ve practically destroyed our island!” weeps President “Doc” Moreno of San Vitenzo, who is incongruously wearing a suit jacket and tie with shorts and sandals. How are my people supposed to ‘put this situation behind us’ when you’ve bombed their houses and crops into oblivion? Even Almighty Bokonon won’t be able to undo this calamity. After you sign whatever treaty East Lebatuck is offering, you must allow our people to settle in @@NAME@@... and give us a little cash to ease our troubles. Isn’t that what neighbors do for one another?”

5. TBD

6. TBD

7. “Reparations! We’re not paying any stinkin’ reparations!” blusters Defense Minister Mack Rimera, who has turned a rather alarming shade of red. “Have you forgotten how they almost annihilated us? Yes, we definitely killed a bunch of their solders. What did they think would happen when they brought nuclear missiles to our borders? This treaty is just a slap in the face — and we’re definitely not disarming or letting in waves of immigrants. You need to walk away from the negotiating table, and hit them with sanctions for good measure. They’re our enemy forevermore.”

[b][anchor=1391]#1391[/anchor]: The World Is Not Radioactive Enough [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
A few months have passed since the G20,000 Summit, where you agreed to station some of your nuclear weapons in San Vitenzo to aid in their defense against the forces of capitalist imperialism.

The Issue
Today was supposed to be a calm day. The issues on your desk this morning were even more trivial than usual. Of course, that’s how it always goes. Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich suddenly bursts into your office, closely followed by two other ministers who are engaged in a spirited debate. Malinovich quickly marches over to your desk and motions for the others to be silent. “Good morning, Comrade Leader. As per our agreement with San Vitenzo, we are in the process of installing a nuclear missile shield as a bulwark against the United Federation’s aggressions. Unfortunately, the capitalist pigs have spotted the missiles and are now demanding that we remove them.”

The Debate
1. Malinovich hands you a transcribed copy of the enemy’s demands before continuing. “You know as well as I do that the United Federation’s leadership are a bunch of spineless weasels who will back down when confronted with a superior fighting force like our own. Tell them to quit interfering, or face our wrath.”

2. “There’s no need to provoke them unnecessarily,” replies Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, who is tuning the guitar that she is infamous for carrying around at all times. “What if we were to propose some sort of negotiation between our government, the United Federation, and San Vitenzo? We don’t have to actually agree on anything; we just want to delay them long enough to install the missiles before the imperialists realize what’s really going on!”

3. “Maybe we should offer a metaphorical carrot instead of a stick?” suggests Warwick Wampeter, one of your Co-Ministers of Totally Legal and Creative Solutions. “I’ve heard that the United Federation’s leader, President Ken J. Finnedy, is worried about his main opponent in their upcoming elections. If we were to discover some embarrassing revelations about this other candidate, and then offer the evidence to Finnedy, I think he would be more willing to turn a blind eye. Of course, all of this quid pro quo will require a few quid — as they say in Albionia — to help us find the most useful information.”

[b][anchor=1392]#1392[/anchor]: No Crime to Spy [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
The United Federation is challenging your right to place missiles on an island nation that is near their borders.

The Issue
After your other advisors have gathered their “world’s best apparatchik” mugs and left the room, your Minister of Intelligence, known only as “N”, approaches you to take advantage of the opportunity for a private conversation.

The Debate
1. “If you have a few spare minutes, Comrade Leader, I’d like to remind you that we have a secret agent in the United Federation. Natasha Milanova is highly skilled in the delicate arts of infiltration, espionage, and making people disappear without a trace. She’s currently operating under the alias of ‘Charlotte Johnson’, a low-level officer at the Libertyville naval base. If you’d like, we can instruct her to focus on intercepting classified information on ship deployments and troop movements, and send us all of the details.”

2. N pauses, picks up a briefcase labeled ‘In Case of Emergency’, and tips it towards an unused mug, dispensing an ample measure of steaming-hot tea. “Ah, that’s much better than that awful People’s EqualiTea they serve in the cafeteria. Anyway, we also have the option of ordering Agent Milanova to directly sabotage the enemy’s naval operations. The downside of this is that she’s much more likely to be caught compared to a simple intelligence-gathering operation — and we have very few agents in the United Federation, so she’s much more valuable than those other incompetent zasranets that work for us. Of course, if things get out of hand and the imperialists try to invade San Vitenzo, they’re going to have a much more difficult time if their ships were to suddenly become coral reef habitats at the bottom of their harbor. So, which is it going to be?”

[b][anchor=1393]#1393[/anchor]: Authorization to Kill [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
The United Federation has asked you to remove your nuclear missiles from San Vitenzo — but they’ll have to use more than words to stop @@NAME@@.

The Issue
The United Federation is not backing down. The people of San Vitenzo — and your troops stationed there — have woken up to find that their island is surrounded by a naval blockade.

The Debate
1. “Well, well, well! It looks like those weasels found their courage,” exclaims Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich, who is pouring something from a flask into his morning coffee. “Our supply ships with the remaining missiles and soldiers won’t be able to get through without a little bit of violence — but maybe that’s what we need right now. When our convoy approaches the blockade line, order the destroyers to open fire and clear a path through the enemy ships.”

2. “We can’t escalate the situation!” shouts Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, playing an anguished version of the ‘@@ANIMAL@@ Blues’ on her guitar. “San Vitenzo may be our ally, but we won’t benefit from getting into a shooting war over a small island with minimal resources. Have our ships perform maneuvers for a day or two to confuse the enemy, then order them to turn around. That should still be enough of a delay for our troops on the island to make some progress installing the first shipment of missiles.”

[b][anchor=1395]#1395[/anchor]: For @@LEADER@@’s Ears Only [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
The vile capitalists of the United Federation attempted to blockade the ports of San Vitenzo to prevent your supply ships from getting through.

The Issue
Instead of sending the imperialist navy to a watery grave, you bravely decided to de-escalate the situation by ordering your navy to turn around. As you are heading toward a meeting to discuss your next steps, you receive a phone call from N, your Minister of Intelligence, who has news from Natasha Milanova and needs to speak with you about her mission.

The Debate
1. “Good morning, boss,” proclaims the steady voice of your spy chief. “Milanova reported that she was able to steal an officer’s uniform and security badge that should allow her to enter the high security areas of their naval base. However, there’s been a small... complication. We believe that one or more enemy agents are aware of her presence. They’re probably too dangerous to ignore. Do you want to give Milanova a free hand to neutralize the threat? A few bullets should take care of... wait, did you hear that clicking sound? I hope this phone isn’t bugged. Code Blue, @@LEADER@@.” N hangs up, leaving you bewildered.

2. After staring at your phone for a few seconds, you feel your right shoe vibrating as blue text starts scrolling across the toe: “Alternatively, if you’re uncomfortable with extrajudicial killings, you could order Milanova to capture any enemy spies and hand them off to us for interrogation. It’s riskier than just shooting them — our enemies may have set up a trap that could result in Milanova’s death — but we might be able to gain valuable intel or use prisoners as a negotiating tool.”

3. While still thinking it over, you’re suddenly interrupted by cooing coming from an open window. A carrier pigeon alights on your shoulder and presents a small note tied to its right leg: “There’s a third way of dealing with this. If you want, you could instruct Milanova to simply ignore the enemy agents and focus on her primary mission. This might just be a diversion to waste our time. Well, let me know of your decision by this evening. PS: This message will self-destruct in ten seconds.”

[b][anchor=1396]#1396[/anchor]: Skycrash [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
You have given instructions to your secret agent and responded to the United Federation’s naval blockade of your ally.

The Issue
Just when you appeared to be in control of the situation, you have received word that the capitalist running-dog lackeys attempted to bomb your missile sites in San Vitenzo. Fortunately, your troops on the ground were able to shoot down one of the bombers, and then apprehended the pilot as he attempted to flee.

The Debate
1. “The enemy pilot thought that he would be able to hide in the forests of San Vitenzo,” smirks Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich. “Our scouts easily spotted the parachute and tracked him down. Comrade Leader, I think we need to send a message to the United Federation by publicly executing their pilot. No one attacks us without swift and violent retribution!”

2. “But that would be throwing away a potential gold mine of information,” sputters Intelligence Minister N. “This pilot has got to know all sorts of military secrets. Let my people try to extract them. I’m sure the San Vitenzans will let us borrow that hook they use for disemboweling criminals.”

3. “It pains me to say this, but the enemy pilot deserves a fair trial and humane treatment,” admits Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, casually strumming a half-tempo version of ‘@@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Rhapsody’ on her guitar. “He’s obviously guilty of aggressions against the Card Slave. However, we can’t sink to the enemy’s level. We must form a military tribunal to allow him to try to explain his actions.”

--------------------------------------------------------------
[b][anchor=1397]#1397[/anchor]: On @@LEADER@@’s Secret Service [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
Secret agent Natasha Milanova is on assignment at the United Federation’s Libertyville naval base.

The Issue
You and your advisors are gathered around the table in a secure meeting room to hear the latest updates from your secret agent, whose static-distorted voice is currently emanating from a phone in the center of the table.

The Debate
1. “Good morning. I regret to inform you that I will require some assistance,” declares Milanova, who doesn’t betray any sense of emotion. “While sabotaging the fuel lines on a Federation destroyer, I overheard a naval officer by the name of Captain Duffle who was planning some type of ‘counter-attack’ on @@NAME@@. I didn’t hear many of the details, but I think something big is being planned at base headquarters. The problem is that it is constantly guarded by a battalion of elite troops from the United Federation’s Violet Berets. No one gets in or out without the top admiral’s explicit approval. I need someone in HQ to hack into the enemy’s personnel files and make it look like I’m an auditor who was sent by President Finnedy to perform a surprise inspection. Can you make it happen?”

2. “That’s not going to work,” asserts Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich, twitching nervously as he continues to gulp coffee from an oversize mug. “The enemy is going to see right through that plan. Remember the time Milanova tried to pass as a Sakuran counter-terrorism operative? What a debacle. If she’s captured, we’ll be completely cut off from our only source of information about the Federation’s military deployments. I think Milanova should just keep her ear to the ground and try to uncover more of this plan without assuming any unnecessary risks.”
