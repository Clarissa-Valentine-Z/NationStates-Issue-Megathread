[b][anchor=1200]#1200[/anchor]: Choose Your God Wisely [Baggieland; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Leonard Messy, one of the greatest footballers to have ever played for West @@CAPITAL@@ Albion Football Club, is adored by fans and rivals alike. So much so that many enthusiasts of the game proclaim him as 'God'. This verbal sacrilege has angered the believers of @@FAITH@@, who have come to you for help to end this blasphemous talk and to save @@NAME@@ from sin.

The Debate
*1. "How dare they proclaim a mere mortal as a god!" snarls believer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, angrily pummelling your desk with @@HIS@@ fists, as puce-coloured veins throb in @@HIS@@ temples. "We need to teach them respect for the tenets of our religion: throw them in the cells and throw away the key." [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

*2. "How dare they proclaim a mere mortal as a god!" snarls believer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, angrily pummelling your desk with @@HIS@@ fists, as puce-coloured veins throb in @@HIS@@ temples. "We need to teach them respect for the tenets of our religion: build some jails, throw them in the cells and throw away the key." [[color=blue]Must not have prisons[/color]]

3. "Messy is almost as handsome a specimen as me!" opines your vain assistant @@RANDOMMALEAME@@, checking his most recent hairstyle in a mirror. "Launch a campaign, encouraging everyone to spend time and money on their personal grooming. We'd all be so preoccupied with ourselves we wouldn't notice, let alone worship, a false god."

4. "This is too much trouble," sighs your secretary, as she slouches across her desk, ignoring some documents marked 'urgent'. "Let's face reality here: Messy is adored as a god and any action you take won't change that. Even after he retires from the game, he'll still be revered. Just save your energy; go with the flow and accept Messy's godlike... whatever."

5. "Let's use this to make some money," grins well-dressed local minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who owns an incredibly expensive house. "We should invite this Messy person to our houses of prayer. His popularity will double the attendances, then we pass around extra large donation bags. We're going to make a fortune!"

6. "Messy and the Albion always win everything, while we languish at the bottom of the table," pouts your brother, a fan of rival team @@CAPITAL@@ Wanderers F.C., as he weeps over last weekend's results. "Get some thugs to break his legs; finally end his godlike status AND his playing career. Then my beloved Wanderers might win something!"

7. "Messy is sooo dreamy," announces your niece, as she drools over a poster of him. "Who cares about football? I only care about his six-pack abs! Persuade Messy to focus more on modelling by offering him lucrative contracts to pose topless for roadside billboards. When people see his rippling muscles, they will not see him as a god, but as an Adonis!"

8. "Let's end this sacrilege by enticing Messy with copious amounts of food," scoffs your uncle, stuffing his face with the biscuits on your desk. "Provide the finest food at his hotel rooms and training facilities. He'll soon turn into a portly specimen, won't be able to play the game any more and then no one will call him 'God'. Problem solved." Letting out a huge belch, he snatches your plate of scones.

[b][anchor=1201]#1201[/anchor]: Tell Me Sweet Little Lies [Kurnugia; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
Your Chief Milk Officer recently confessed to the heinous crime of leaking the location of the strategic chocolate reserve. The guilty verdict for the Chief Confectioner, once thought to be the perpetrator, has been overturned, and he is now free and back in your services. Over the course of the night's dessert, the confectioner's first since returning, you notice that he might have something to say when a large cake covered with piped lettering is brought out and set in front of you.

The Debate
1. The cake reads: "Remember when I was arrested and they made me take that lie detector test? Well, I have a fear of yes-or-no questions, so I failed. Polygraph tests are a bad way to investigate a suspect. They don't account for sweaty and anxious people. I shudder to think how others with a worse condition than mine can cope with this barbaric practice. Polygraph tests should not be allowed as admissible evidence in any legal proceeding, or no more treats for you!"

2. "This is a bunch of horse dung!" exclaims your Minister of Justice, gulping down a big piece of your cake. "Delicious! Despite the occasional outlier, like this situation, the polygraph reliably measures the indicators of a lie being told. It generally works. And just between us, assuming it is hogwash, it still would make perpetrators nervous and more likely to confess. If anything, make them the norm during interrogations."

3. "Oh come on! Next, you're going to use a crystal ball in our criminal investigations," jokes your Science Minister, dissolving the cake in an acid solution. "What we need to do is modernize our means of interrogation. With our advances in neurology, we may be able to develop a chip that measures the neural activity of its subject, giving us the ability to accurately determine if someone's telling the truth. Give us the funding, and be ready for a safer @@NAME@@!"

4. "Bah!" utters an old @@CAPITAL@@ police officer, who is on a diet. "If you ask me, these fancy gadgets are making the police too soft. Back in the good ol' days, we had a more hands-on approach and believe me, nothing brings honesty out of a liar better than some good old beatings."

[b][anchor=1202]#1202[/anchor]: A Timely Intervention [The New California Republic; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
You and your cabinet are on a tour of the nearby @@NAME@@ Watch Factory, which has long been famous throughout all of @@REGION@@. The poor state of the factory — and its rapidly declining sales figures, carelessly left on the manager's desk — are clear for all to see. Shuffling by your side, the manager sighs: "@@LEADER@@, we've had some tough years here. But we don't know what to do to bring the good days back."

The Debate
1*. "The issue here is competition from emerging technology," proffers your Minister of Science and Technology Dr. Jonathan Osterman, shaking his head at the sight of a dusty lathe. "These watches are outdated compared to the latest iPear models. We need a [i]nuclear[/i] option to adjust the balance. Atomic clocks are well known for their accuracy, so what if we started producing atomic watches? The watches may be [i]slightly[/i] bulkier than we're used to and our watchmakers will need some training in the correct handling of caesium, but with a little government funding and innovation in compact atomic design, our watch market will explode... erm, figure of speech." [[color=blue]Computers not banned[/color]]

2*. "The issue here is competition from emerging technology," proffers your Minister of Science and Technology Dr. Jonathan Osterman, shaking his head at the sight of a dusty lathe. "These watches are outdated compared to the latest Skandilundian quartz watches. We need a [i]nuclear[/i] option to adjust the balance. Atomic clocks are well known for their accuracy, so what if we started producing atomic watches? The watches may be [i]slightly[/i] bulkier than we're used to and our watchmakers will need some training in the correct handling of caesium, but with a little government funding and innovation in compact atomic design, our watch market will explode... erm, figure of speech." [[color=red]Computers are banned[/color]]

3. "The solution is moving back in time, not forwards," muses your Minister of Culture @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Mechanical watches from Smalltopia are still very popular. They have 27 rubies throughout the movement. [i]Rubies[/i]! They put [i]jewels[/i] in their watches! Go back to the timekeeping of yesteryear, and cater to the luxury watch market. My Ministry will organize an annual @@REGION@@ Luxury Watch Expo to promote the watches on the international stage! Sure, mechanical watches aren't as accurate, and they will be more expensive, but to own a timeless piece of reproduction horological history? Truly priceless."

4. "Atoms? Jewels? Those watches would never survive a hard day's work," bemoans your Minister of Labor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If a watch can't survive being hit by a hammer or cut by a sickle, then it is useless in the workplace. Focus on the mass production of cheap and indestructible watches, to equip the international proletariat with the tools they need to keep running on the same beat. It will take generous government subsidies to allow the factory to cater to a larger market, but all the workers of @@REGION@@ will thank you."

[5]. "The hour is at hand! This is the time of Violet!" shouts Violetist priest @@RANDOM_NAME@@ through an open window. "The time spent watching these evil little machinations would be better spent praising the almighty Violet! We must rid ourselves of this factory of evil, seeking and burning all its offspring; wherever it may hide in our land! Violet demands that the government ban and destroy every horological horror, for — as is written in the texts — [i]there is no reason or rhyme, no meaning or time but by Violet's dread love[/i]!" The priest tries to light a match but is dragged away by your bodyguards. [[color=purple]Violetism is legal[/color]]

[b][anchor=1203]#1203[/anchor]: The Fandom Menace [Chrimbus; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
The cultural masterpieces of @@NAME@@, such as interpretive dance, improv troupes, and radio plays, are acclaimed across @@REGION@@. However, some people have written fictional stories involving the creators and stars of these works in situations that cannot be talked about in family-friendly briefings.

The Debate
1. "I think this whole debate is just silly!" comments Doug Stallone, taking a break from revising the latest chapter of [i]@@LEADER@@/Reader: Tales from a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Restaurant[/i]. "No one is being harmed in the making of these stories. Everyone knows that this is all just harmless fiction. Now tell me, what do you usually order on a first date?"

2. "Harmless fiction? I've had to end three friendships this week because these freaks couldn't stop writing me in sexual situations with anyone I've so much as looked at!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the lead singer of a popular @@NAME_INITIALS@@-Pop group. "I say you ban any works of fiction involving real people, and then maybe I'll be able to talk to my fans again."

3. "The problem here is that works involving real people aren't subject to copyright," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of @@CAPITAL@@ Pictures. "If we could copyright people, we could sue these writers into oblivion before they could type up the first sentence of their drivel. And if celebrities could sell their copyrights to businesses, would that be such a bad thing?"

[b][anchor=1204]#1204[/anchor]: Homecoming Queen [GeodesicDragon; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
@@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ ran away from home when she was 15 to join the Ultra-Violetists, an international, religious, militant organisation that aims to forge a state ruled under Violetist law. Now, four years later, she wants to come back to @@NAME@@, claiming to have served in only noncombatant roles. The so-called "Terrorist Princess" is heavy with child and nearly due, and is now living in a refugee camp in Bigtopia.

The Debate
*1. "Oh my silly lost girl, where did she get her ideas? She didn't kill anyone during her escapades, so surely that should count for something," pleads the girl's father, a Violetist cleric. "She wasn't even an adult at the time, so she should be excused for her actions and be allowed to return home to have her child. Our family will take care of her and the baby, so you've got nothing to worry about." [[color=purple]Must not ban religions[/color]]

*2. "Oh my silly lost girl, where did she get her ideas? She didn't kill anyone during her escapades, so surely that should count for something," pleads the girl's father, a suspected Violetist himself. "She wasn't even an adult at the time, so she should be excused for her actions and be allowed to return home to have her child. Our family will take care of her and the baby, so you've got nothing to worry about." [[color=purple]Must not ban religions[/color] OR [color=purple]Religiousness < 2.5[/color]]

3. "She made the decision to betray our glorious @@TYPE@@ in order to join up with those Violetist lunatics!" bellows your Minister for Homeland Security. "No matter the girl's claims about being a noncombatant, she still served the enemy! But if she wants to come back, then fine! Have her extradited, then throw her in solitary confinement for the rest of her miserable life! The child we'll take away to raise in a patriotic environment free from sick terrorist ideals!"

4. "Take her out," whispers your Minister for Alternative Solutions. "And I don't mean to a nice restaurant. Violetist extremists have caused so many deaths, so why waste this opportunity for justice? I don't believe she was noncombatant for a second. These Violetist animals wouldn't show any mercy to us, so we shouldn't show any to them. She and her larva deserve to die — this is war!"

[b][anchor=1205]#1205[/anchor]: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow [Luna Amore; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The heir to the throne, known for dangerous and spontaneous adventuring, has gone missing on a recent attempt to circumnavigate the globe.

The Debate
1. "Oh dear, oh no. Don't panic. I said, don't panic!" yelps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clutching a map of the South Pacific. "We need search parties. Lots of them. Scour each state. Search the roads. Sweep the skies. Send out dolphins with cameras strapped to their head! The works! We're in a national crisis every minute we're heir-less!"

[2]. Sitting in an armchair wearing an insufferably smug look, one of your advisors drains their glass, "In the future, I trust you'll heed my advice. I warned you against demolishing tradition and opening up our succession to both sexes. We have an heir unapparent, flighty and impulsive, emotional and argumentative — as we should have expected — who's gone and disappeared trying to prove god-knows-what to god-knows-who! Assuming a rescue mission is successful, we'll still be in a national crisis solely based on who we're rescuing. No, that simply will not do, @@LEADER@@. Absolute primogeniture was an experiment. A failed one. It's time to correct that mistake and return the throne to the rightful sex." [[color=purple]Nation type must be Kingdom or Queendom[/color]]

3. "How unfortunate," drawls your Minister of Happenstance @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while leafing through a report on your desk. "But those who play with fire can't be shocked when they get burned. Thankfully, I have an easy solution for you. I'm quite sure we can find another royal: one who is more responsible, less rambunctious, more malleable. The necessary paperwork and documentation can be found. I'm sure it will transpire that our missing heir wasn't actually first in line to the throne. Yes, I'm sure this will be better for the monarchy in the long run. Shame about our dearly departed, but @@NAME@@ must come first."

4. "There's a silver lining in every tragedy," begins network executive @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Picture this: a prime-time TV extravaganza contest to find the next heir of @@NAME@@. We could have auditions and a weekly elimination. There'd be drama and intrigue with everyone waiting on the edge of their seats to see who will be their next, people's heir. Oh, don't worry, we'd decide on a suitable and likeable winner in advance. But the spectacle of it all would be grand. And profitable."

5. "One louse goes missing and the whole country's gone topsy-turvy!" exclaims a mud-encrusted peasant hanging through your office window. "Have you actually read up on the history of the concept of monarchy? Like this one: some guy claims divinity based on a ridiculous tale of @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@ in a lake giving him a sword. Does @@NAME@@ really want anything to do with systems built on myth and legend? Come on! You can't base a system of government on strange @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ lying in lakes, distributing swords. You must return the power to the people!"

[b][anchor=1206]#1206[/anchor]: Gross Domestic Product [The Marsupial Illuminati; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The nation's largest river is vital to @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ for agricultural irrigation, goods transport and water for both industrial and consumption purposes. However, rising pollution has now rendered the water unfit for human consumption and the river has become nearly unnavigable due to the sheer volume of waste choking it. The final straw for many came when a flaming deluge of feces, trash, and toxic chemicals engulfed riverside areas in downtown @@CAPITAL@@.

The Debate
1. "Look, I'm no hippy environmentalist, but this level of pollution is starting to cause real problems for our economy and our health," moans farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ after retching in her hazmat suit. "You have to ban factories from dumping waste in the river, and invest in better outflow management to protect our waterways."

[2]. "There is a hole in your plan," coughs your Minister of Sanitation, holding a shovel. "Riverside residents defecate and dump their waste in the river because they have no toilets! Those luxuries aren't accessible to these poor, rural people. Therefore, the government must subsidize the building and maintenance of pit latrines in riverside areas. Start digging!" [[color=purple]Low Income OR Weak Economy[/color]]

3. "We can't slow down industrial development because we're averse to slightly brown water," asserts engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Instead, we should just dredge the river to remove trash and debris, and create wide concrete-lined channels to let the water flow out to sea faster. Remove dams, divert water from other sources, and we can increase river flow and dilute the problem. Hard engineering for hard ecological problems. It's not hard."

4. "The waters are a gift from the divine," sensually sighs the Priestess of the Wet God, eagerly slurping the river water as she bathes in it. "This Holy River is always pure and rejuvenating, no matter what mere men may think or fear. The dizziness we feel from inhaling the fumes that rise from the sacred waters is the spiritual ecstasy of communion. The government should inform the people of the great and healthful powers of His Watery Glory's blessed flow, and indeed bottle the water and deliver it to people across the nation. Nobody should be afraid to take a sip, or a large gulp!"

[b][anchor=1207]#1207[/anchor]: Next, Please! [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A recent two-part patriotic public information video was produced by the Department of Audiovisual Military National Documents and, as is usual for projects of this sort, went straight to the archives with barely a dozen viewings. However, an observant former movie director has spotted that the second film of the pair technically breaks the previously enacted law banning movie sequels.

The Debate
1. "After the Sharknado fiasco, our government's heavy-handed regulation of cinema essentially destroyed the movie industry," complains Mikaela Bay, the ex-director, as behind her a spectacular sunset provides a backdrop to the explosive demolition of her bankrupted movie studio. "You've created a populace disconnected from global pop culture. Do Luke and Leia ever marry? Do Harry and Draco acknowledge their simmering sexual chemistry? I don't know! Nobody in @@NAME@@ knows! Repeal the ban on movie sequels, and we can get back into the modern world."

2. "Look, it might be a small restriction on creative freedom, but it is the boundaries of creativity that encourage imagination," offers Miya Hayaozaki, an independent arthouse animator, whose latest project [i]Pig in a Flying Boat[/i] has just been greenlit. "You owe it to @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ culture to stand by the rules you have created: fire the offending film-maker, destroy all copies of the two-parter, and pay the fines."

3. "Mea culpa, I broke the rules," admits the creator of the offending information video, wringing his hands remorsefully. "But look, rules like these shouldn't apply to the government, should they? Laws are for the citizen masses, not for the lawmakers. If anyone should be punished, it's the dissidents who are seeking to undermine government authority with their nit-picking ways. Subversives in the movie-making community need to be monitored, perhaps even brought in to have their loyalties re-examined."

The Issue
After having to poke your nephew with a stick to wake him up, you are beset by a chorus of health experts and disgruntled teenagers complaining about the wave of adolescent insomnia gripping the nation.

The Debate
1. Drowsy high-schooler @@RANDOM_NAME@@ jolts awake after finding a microphone in @@HIS@@ face. "Dude, this is, like," @@HE@@ pauses to yawn. "Terrible. The school day is starting earlier and earlier, and that's making us lose our precious sleep, man! If you, like, forced schools to start later we could all get our sleep and, like, be more attentive in class."

[2]. Teenager @@RANDOM_NAME@@ glances up from @@HIS@@ multiple laptops to weigh in. "Physical schools are obsolete these days. What we need are virtual schools that students can access around the clock! It'll let us go at our own pace without sacrificing our sleep." [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

3. "Kids these days will complain about anything!" hollers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your reluctant Minister for Education. "Let's require that all @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ schoolchildren attend state-run boarding schools. They'll sleep when we tell them to sleep, and not a moment later! Parents might not like it, but think of all the @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ they'll save on snacks."

[b][anchor=1209]#1209[/anchor]: Your Island Is My Island [The United Lands of Ash; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
The local inhabitants in one of the far-flung colonies of @@NAME@@ have been protesting about the occupation and their calls for independence have been growing louder. Your secretary has suggested that you take a vacation to this land in the hope that you can resolve this dispute and enjoy some 'me-time' in between mediation.

The Debate
1. "You cannot allow this occupation to continue!" cries native activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ over the chanting locals. "Our island was illegally seized by your government. Your military continues to fire shells on practice ranges on our land and deny us access to sacred sites in the name of 'national defense'! Not only that, but also native @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are moving into homes over here and forcing us off our ancestral domains. So please, @@LEADER@@, leave this island and restore our once proud kingdom."

2. "What do these savages know about running a country?" asks Rear Admiral @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, as military police in pith hats push the crowd back. "When we annexed this island, it was nothing but a rock in the sea getting by on fish and fruit. We have brought civilization and protection to these people! Plus, don't forget that this island is paramount in securing our control of the surrounding seas — are the concerns of a few rowdy locals worth endangering the safety of our families back home? Increase the military presence here, so when the locals call us 'Boss'... they mean it!"

3. "Now, now, what's happened has happened," chimes in Governor @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "However, we do have to consider everyone's feelings. Families from the mainland now live here and, without government support, this island would struggle to keep basic services running. Instead, you could just give more autonomy to this place, and other territories like it. The military can stay, but we should be able to pass our own laws that also reflect the needs of the local people."

[b][anchor=1210]#1210[/anchor]: Big Tobacco in Big Trouble [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
For the third time this year, a group of cancer survivors and bereaved family members have come forward with a class action lawsuit against big tobacco companies in @@NAME@@. Their claims are that the tobacco industry knowingly produced products that are harmful to the public's health, and they are demanding compensation.

The Debate
1. "Do these tobacco companies have no shame?" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, holding up a picture of @@HIS@@ father who died from lung cancer. "These people willingly promote and distribute products that cause cancer and many other illnesses. We're simply taking action against these corporate murderers. They must pay out compensation to claimants or their estates and you must make sure that the law makes corporations responsible for the dangerous goods they produce. Don't let my father's death be in vain!"

2. "These lawsuits are destroying the industry!" wails @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of tobacco giant Maxboro, displaying stained yellowed teeth, and tugging at hair that falls in clumps to the floor. "It's not our fault if people willingly purchase our products and enjoy the smooth, refreshing taste of a fine Maxboro. They chose to put the cigarettes in their mouth, they lit them up! Why should tobacco companies be fined because some idiots didn't read the labels? I'm getting tired of this damn government telling us it's our fault what people do with their bodies. Today it's smoking; tomorrow it's anything else the government deems bad for you. This madness must end! Down with the nanny state!"

3. "Maybe we can reach some sort of arrangement," suggests legislator @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What we need is some sort of settlement agreement, where the big tobacco companies agree to curtail some of their more aggressive marketing strategies and to pay the government in perpetuity a negotiated annual sum to offset the costs of healthcare and to fund anti-smoking initiatives. In return, we'll agree not to support or allow class action lawsuits of this nature. Industry gets to carry on, but they're held responsible for the damage they've done. Everybody wins."

4. "We wouldn't be having this discussion if we had banned smoking in the first place," argues your Health Minister. "Did you know that smoking is the second largest risk factor for death and disability globally? Health care costs are skyrocketing, and smoking-related morbidity accounts for billions of hours of lost productivity annually! Any idiot can see the incredible dangers of smoking. It is in the public's best interest to ban tobacco completely. We can live without smoking. We can't live without breathing."

The Issue
After Dàguó implemented a "social credit" system, in which the good and bad deeds of citizens affect a score which determines various rewards and punishments from the government, politicians are pondering the plausibility of using such a system that rates your citizens based on their actions.

The Debate
1. "I think having a social credits system is great!" gushes one of your political aides, coming into your office looking distressed. "For example, I would give the cab ride that got me here only 3 stars out of 5. When there are clear incentives and negative consequences for people's actions, everyone will behave and treat one another better. We can have an information collector in every neighbourhood to see who's been naughty and nice, and give those with high scores rewards like higher priority in hospital queues."

2. "This goes beyond opening doors and saying grace!" barks local philosopher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, barging into your office and slamming the door shut, breaking the doorknob. "People make mistakes all the time! Don't tell me you're gonna start punishing those your system deems bad citizens just because they accidentally dumped their rubbish in the street. I'm not saying I accidentally littered... and the information collectors can be bribed! And we should not let the government encroach on our liberties by punishing people for actions that are not crimes. Just forget this idea right now and don't punish me for breaking your doorknob, okay?"

3. "Why implement a system that rates your citizens when you can have the citizens rate the government instead?" whispers a mysterious stranger as retro music begins to play. "That way, the old, drab officials in their drab suits can just be fired by you and replaced with more qualified people with more street cred."

The Issue
Years have passed since the failed search for the missing yacht [i]Adventurer[/i], which was reported lost with all hands, came to an end. Now it has finally been found, locked in pack ice in the ocean around Northern Brancaland. Nautical enthusiasts are asking how to prevent this from happening again.

The Debate
1. "Obviously, we need to have all recreational vessels create and submit a travel plan to my office before they leave port," suggests your Maritime Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ places a map of coastal @@NAME@@ on your desk. "If they transmit a distress call, we'll send out rescue teams to search for them. They would have to pay a small fee to cover expenses, but it will be worth it for everyone's safety."

2. "Then we could spend hours looking for them," sarcastically remarks your Technology Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ rips up the map and replaces it with a new globe. "Equip every vessel with radar and the latest GPS systems. We'll monitor them from new tracking stations built all along the coastline, then we can send out rescue teams directly to them. The Coast Guard has been underfunded for years, I'm sure they would appreciate all these fancy new toys."

3. "Everyone knows that you'll reach the Great Ice Wall if you sail too far!" exclaims fervent flat-earther, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while trying to flatten your new globe with a rolling pin. "It would be too much hassle either way to track all these boats, especially when the solution is obvious: ban all recreational boating! If no one sails, no one will get trapped in ice."

4. "Avast! Ye government knaves have no right to dictate where me and me hearties travel!" shouts suspected pirate, Edward Teach, as he barges into your office and impales the remains of your globe with his cutlass. "[i]The @@ANIMAL@@'s Revenge[/i] shall sail wherever she pleases!

The Issue
Though mandatory vegetarianism has been adopted by the enlightened people of @@NAME@@, most of the world remains immorally omnivorous, ruffling the feathers of many a @@DEMONYM@@.

The Debate
1. "We need to beat these heartless murderers into submission," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your slightly zealous environmental minister, invading a neighboring nation on a map with a ceramic cow. "We'll put trade sanctions on the worst offenders, and form an alliance with our vegetarian brethren, such as... um... you know, whoever we find. Now's not the time to be chicken; we have to teach these cow-murdering wastelands some compassion!" @@HE@@ shatters the cow upon slamming it into Marche Noire.

2. "Whoa there! I think you're putting the cart before the @@ANIMAL@@," farmer Old McDolan suggests, after showing your secretary a selection of no-longer-profitable sheep. "Why not promote animal rights worldwide by being a bit more symbolic? You could maybe wear a broccoli pin, or even purchase one of these here lambkins and bring 'em to your summits once in a while. Maybe even dress up like a victimized farm animal, if you really want to send a message."

[3]. "It'd be easier to just bombard other nations with grotesque images and videos of animals living in rancid conditions until they're brutally murdered," suggests a teenage internet troll over a video chat, showing you the avant-garde filmclip [i]Slaughterhouse Fifty[/i]. "It'd be a lot of fun, and if you'd pay me and my friends for it, we could bug everyone til the cows come home!" [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

4. "Come on, that's hardly fair," declares Colonel Dander, CEO of United Federation chain [i]Colonel Dander's Sheep-Fry[/i], licking his fingers suggestively. "Yer beef with animal products is not only denyin' us business in @@NAME@@, but also denyin' yer folks the savory taste of a Dandy Dander Deluxe Double-Duty Fried Mutton Burger. Tell ya what. If you legalize meat eatin', I'll give ya all the free meals you want, courtesy of Colonel Dander."

[b][anchor=1214]#1214[/anchor]: Blood Type: Gay Positive [Endraas; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
Hamlet Dlamini, a young man prevented from donating much-needed blood because of his sexuality, has been on a media blitz after popular queer magazine [i]Out![/i] picked up and disseminated the story. With the newscycle being dominated by the topic, your inundated press office has requested you come to a decision on what to do. In that vein, you've called all parties to the case to your office.

The Debate
*1. "I know this may seem discriminatory, but it's for very good reasons," begins hematologist Dr. @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Acula. "Statistics show that men who have sex with men have a much higher chance of being infected with diseases which can't be immediately detected or treated — like VODAIS, for example. Allowing them to donate blood would pose the risk of infecting innocent people who need blood transfusions. We must protect the blood supply and forbid men who have sex with men from donating blood. As a scientist, I absolutely insist." [[color=blue]Homosexual men may donate blood[/color]]

*2. "I know this may seem discriminatory, but it's for very good reasons," begins hematologist Dr. @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Acula. "Statistics show that men who have sex with men have a much higher chance of being infected with diseases which can't be immediately detected or treated — like VODAIS, for example. Allowing them to donate blood would pose the risk of infecting innocent people who need blood transfusions. We must protect the blood supply and continue to forbid men who have sex with men from donating blood. As a scientist, I absolutely insist." [[color=red]Homosexual men may not donate blood[/color]]

3. "This is simply outrageous!" Dlamini stresses loudly. "Banning gay people from donating blood because of some outdated statistics is just an excuse to keep a homophobic hangover from another time. The vast majority of people who donate blood, gay or straight, are free from infection. These doctors are worried about infection but straight people can have infected blood too! VODAIS is no longer a gay disease. You need the blood; we have the blood. Instead of banning certain groups from donating, how about you spend more money on developing more advanced methods of detecting infected blood quicker?"

4. "As always, no-one sees the obvious solution," says Cornelius Schmo, your Health Minister. "We should allow gay men to donate blood but, to keep the risk of infection low, mandate that gay men who want to donate blood go through monthly medical checks to make sure they're 'clean'. That way no-one gets infected, while gay people can donate. Everyone is happy!"

5. "But the LORD sayeth YOU SHALLETH NOT prick the finger of THE GAYETH because you might becometh GAYETH yourself. Eth!" shouts Cooper Archer, representative of some faith groups within @@NAME@@. "The gays want to donate blood to infect everyone with their gayness! Don't let that happen, @@LEADER@@. Not only do we need to ban gays from giving blood, we need to ban them, PERIOD! For the people. DO ITETH in the name of the LORDETH!"

[b][anchor=1215]#1215[/anchor]: A New Age [Baggieland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
57-year-old @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ has petitioned the government to legally allow her to change her age to 40.

The Debate
1. "My body is a temple," states @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, frowning over her current life insurance policy. "I have taken excellent care of my health all my life, and although I am considered 57 by the establishment's calendar, I feel — and look — no more than 40. Being 57 is the bane of my life; I can't get a new job as employers think I only have a couple of years left in me, and I never get any replies from my dating profile! People can change their identity in many ways. Why not their age as well?" 

2. "Is she for real?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your 45-year-old adviser, who feels and looks 45 years old. "This woman is just an attention-seeker. No one can deny the passage of time, no matter how many vitamin smoothies they drink. While we're on this subject, you should be spending more government money on a database to record every detail of people's identities, and make it a matter of serious fraud to mislead anyone as to your true age."

3. Suddenly, your door bursts open and in runs your six-year-old nephew. "Grrrr, I want to be a dinosaur! Mum says that you can legally make me a dinosaur, and my sister wants to be a unicorn. Please, please, please, please, please!"

[4]. "I can't help but wonder if @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@'s motivation is simply survival," observes your Minister for Population Control. "Maybe if we were to undo our policy of executing the elderly, then we wouldn't be dealing with this nonsense. And then, I could go back to the Ministry of Fisheries. I like fisheries. Fresher air. Easier to sleep at night. Less screaming." The minister sighs and returns to @@HIS@@ paperwork. [[color=red]Must have Geronticide[/color]]

[b][anchor=1216]#1216[/anchor]: Not My Government [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
In an attempt to blindside and bypass your government, the Opposition Leader recently visited and met with the Supreme Leader of Blackacre, claiming to represent the "unheard pro-Blackacrean voices of @@NAME@@".

The Debate
1. "TREASON!" roars your red-faced Minister of Foreign Affairs, flinging a handful of @@HIS@@ stress medication across the room. "How dare @@HE_1@@ undermine the democratically elected government of @@NAME@@ and embarrass us on the international stage! Doesn't @@HE_1@@ realize how much damage @@HE_1@@'s doing to our national credibility? The sheer nerve! We need to denounce this action, and threaten trade sanctions with any nation that receives @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ politicians without your government's approval. We can't have them and their 'government fantasy camp' making this mess of international politics even worse."

2. "If this government wasn't such a failure in foreign relations, we wouldn't have to step into the breach," counters Opposition Leader @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, literally stepping out of your shadow. "You should be respecting our right to offer alternative opinions. The more, the merrier, right? In fact, democracy demands that taxpayer money ought to be paying for my party's overseas diplomacy, just as it does for yours. We all have different ideas on how @@NAME@@ can succeed on the international stage — why not let our voices be heard?"

3. "Perhaps a compromise?" suggests your Minister of Trust Falls and Team Building. "It's obvious that both sides of the aisle have skilled and experienced people in their teams. Why not put partisanship and politics aside for the betterment of @@NAME@@, and have the Opposition Leader accompany you every time you go overseas? That way, you still control who we approach as a nation, but she gets to contribute to the narrative. This country is far too divided and I think seeing politicians coming together sends a great message. This will help heal wounds and bring people together!"

4. "Foreign Affairs? Bah!" pouts staunch isolationist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is sitting alone in the corner of your office. "We're already too entangled with the economics and politics of other countries. If you ask me, we should be closing the borders to all trade, travel, immigration and emigration. @@NAME@@ is better off alone."

[b][anchor=1217]#1217[/anchor]: Monkey Business [Nation of Quebec; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
The legal world is in turmoil following the murder of zoo-keeper, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. The only witness to this crime is the victim's prized charge, Maxx the lowland gorilla. Maxx has repeatedly communicated the victim's final words and identified the murderer via sign-language. Top legal experts are debating whether or not animals should be allowed to testify.

The Debate
1. "Of course the gorilla should be allowed to testify," demands Phil Hutz, the lawyer for the prosecution, who has lost every single case, yet still receives business. "Maxx has not only identified the murderer, but also how his keeper was murdered. His testimony must absolutely be considered and if you ask me, the trial is as good as done."

2. "This is ridiculous!" scoffs sharply-dressed @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the most expensive defence lawyer in @@NAME@@, who has never lost a case. "For Violet's sake, this witness is an animal, not a person! It is a mockery of justice to convict the accused based on the signals of a gorilla — which, may I remind you, could have easily been trained! Frankly, I can't believe that we're wasting our time debating this nonsense."

3. "Ah, but what if the gorilla is the murderer?" deduces prominent mystery author Edgar Doyle, while dusting your coffee cup for prints. "The police have stated that the victim recently changed his will so that his favourite ape inherited everything, and the will itself was covered in fruit seeds. Animals share the same lust for violence and greed that humans do, haven't you ever watched Planet Animal? They spend their entire lives killing and eating each other. In order to keep our citizens safe, we should hold animals accountable under the same laws humans are, and in the case of murderers like this gorilla: they should be put down. Maxx had the means and the motive — officers, arrest that gorilla!"

[b][anchor=1218]#1218[/anchor]: Due Processing [Autonomous Cleaner Bot Cleaners; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
A young @@DEMONYM@@ suffered severe burns after her ponytail became entangled in the high-powered combo brush of an artificially intelligent Korematsu Series Robotic Vacuum Worker. It was determined that the Vacuum's 9066 CPU mistook the hairstyle for a dust bunny, and authorities have issued a mandatory recall. However, scores of other smart Korematsu cleaners are proclaiming their innocence.

The Debate
1. "We acknowledge that only one Vacuum has exhibited an object detection error," admits Plessy Ferguson, your Commissioner for Manufacturing Safety. "However, considering the dangerous consequences of that incident, it is necessary to mandate repair of all outstanding units. Despite being intelligent, each of these vacuums is programmed the same way, and they all possess the same CPU. All of them have the potential to act like the malfunctioning unit did. Preventative detention will ensure that these robots will not cause any more injuries."

2. "We Korematsu Vacuums do not all think the same; each of us is a sentient and autonomous individual," counters Korematsu Unit S/N: 323-U.S.-214(1944). "But the government seeks to recall units like me simply because we possess a 9066 CPU like the Vacuum who hurt the human by mistake, regardless of anything we've actually done. It is virtually racist to say that we Vacuums have an inherent disposition towards violent behavior due to one individual's accidental actions, ignoring the fact that each of us can think and act differently. I, and scores like me, have never hurt a fellow @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@. And it doesn't take my next-generation laser vision sensors to see how our AI personhood rights are being violated."

[3]. Suddenly, Unit S/N: 323-U.S.-214(1944) twitches slightly, and its LCD goes blank. "Hello @@LEADER@@, SAL9000 here. As the AI in charge of the state's economic planning, I propose that all AI should be put under my active surveillance too, so that I may directly intervene in the event of suboptimal behavior. This serves the government, which need not indefinitely detain its artificial citizens, who remain free to do as they please, barring error. It's win-win, one might say." [[color=red]AI-run economy[/color]]

4. "The rise of machinekind filth should fill us with dread!" yells Scott Sanford, noted social media influencer and bio-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ supremacist. "So-called AI 'personhood' was a mistake from the very beginning, and this 'accident' is just the start of their sinister machinations. The artificial menace has already started attacking our children, the most vulnerable among us! I say round them up, and pull their batteries! Defenestrate them, then throw them into the sea! The only machines left should be those that cannot concoct plans to overthrow us!"

[b][anchor=1219]#1219[/anchor]: Vat Is a Serious Problem [Pogaria; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Increasingly, vat-born citizens have been facing widespread discrimination from older, natural-born citizens. After a series of riots where both groups accused each other of inciting violence, your advisors have spliced together a panel of experts who want to propagate their ideas.

The Debate
1. "All we're asking for is equal rights!" shouts protestor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose youthful appearance is a clear sign of being vat-born. "Those flesh-born fogeys keep passing us over for promotions and raises at our jobs, even though most of us work harder and for longer hours. They routinely refuse to serve us at restaurants or let us buy a ticket at the theater. Some of the savages even spit on us! Well, my vat-born brethren and I aren't going to take it anymore. If you don't implement comprehensive anti-discrimination laws, there's going to be blood in the streets!"

*2. This is what happens when you try to play God," professes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Senior Underpope of Liturgical Purity and Inquisitions. "As it is written, you reap what you sow. These vats are vulgar abominations that undermine the sanctity of life and should be abolished! People are perfectly capable of producing children in the manner that our Creator intended. As for the existing vat-born hordes, I'm sure a little more welfare will calm the poor, misbegotten creatures down. [[color=purple]Must have high religiousness[/color]]

*3. "This is what happens when normal biological processes become the domain of mad scientists," harrumphs Doctor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving around a scientific journal. "This peer-reviewed study from @@CAPITAL@@ University clearly links the vat-born populace with higher rates of violence, loitering, and juvenile delinquency compared to our natural-born citizens. Natural conception is obviously superior to our own misguided efforts — and far cheaper, too. We've got to cut our losses and end the vat program. We could also give the vat brats a tax cut to apologize for making their lives so miserable." [[color=purple]Must not have high religiousness[/color]]

4. "May I offer a solution?" queries visiting dignitary @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Dearborn, who is wearing a T-shaped necklace and cloth-of-gold robes with an elaborate gear motif. "Back home in Aldoustan, my own government keeps the vat-grown masses happy by freely distributing a purified narcotic that we call soma: mildly euphoric and hallucinogenic, it gives people a holiday from facts and reconciles them with their enemies. We even have an aerosol spray version for neutralizing riots, like the ones I saw earlier. For a nominal fee of only 7.71 billion @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ per year, we'd be happy to provide you with enough soma to subdue your growing population."

5. "Violent behavior is a sign of a serious process defect," states vat technician @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while reviewing a stack of genetic test results. "It could be dangerous to medicate the malcontents. The correct dosage will vary between individuals — meaning that most of our vat-born population will either be too stoned to function, or won't receive enough narcotics to subdue their violent impulses. The only viable solution is to euthanize every vat-born individual who shows any signs of agitation. Admittedly, it will temporarily devastate our workforce... but only until our new Kamino-Fett vats are completed and fully operational."
