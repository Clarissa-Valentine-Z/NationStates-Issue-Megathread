[b][anchor=760]#760[/anchor]: A Debatable Question [Maxemia; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
It's election season in @@NAME@@, and several of the smaller political parties are voicing their concerns about being left out of the big televised debates, again.

The Debate
1. "It's so unfair," sulks Lord Kettlenoggin, leader of the [i]Marxist Alliance For The Advancement Of Agrarian Libertarianism [/i](MAFTAOAL), while speaking to a local gathering of six people. "We polled just below one percent last election cycle, and I demand to be heard! In fact, anybody that wants to join in should have the right to do so. The big parties are just scared to let us debate with them, but don't let that get in the way of what really matters; vox populism, eh, populi."

*2. "It's both fair and efficient," lectures @@RANDOMNAME@@, majority whip for the [i]Liberal Conservatives[/i], while putting out a cigar on a [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Supremacy Party[/i] campaign pamphlet. "Only the biggest parties stand a real chance at power, and muddling what really matters with thirty different fringe causes – that have no ground in reality – would be unfair to the voters. Trying to mess with the way we've been doing political debates since the dawn of time will only serve to put mental stress on the masses, so let's not." [[color=blue]Smoking is legal[/color]]

*3. "It's both fair and efficient," lectures @@RANDOMNAME@@, majority whip for the Liberal Conservatives, while crushing a [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Supremacy Party[/i] campaign pamphlet under @@HIS/HER@@ heel. "Only the biggest parties stand a real chance at power, and muddling what really matters with thirty different fringe causes, which have no ground in reality, would be unfair to the voters. Trying to mess with the way we've been doing political debates since the dawn of time will only serve to put mental stress on the masses, so let's not." [[color=red]Smoking is illegal[/color]]

4. "I don't think we have to go to either extreme here," suggests Simon Cobweb, former TV-producer and the freshest face on your team of spin-doctors. "If we gave the power to decide eligibility to some non-partisan commission, they could set specific criteria to be included in the televised debates, and a panel of impartial judges could rate prospects based on that. Now, that's fair. It might cost an extra @@CURRENCY@@ or two, but can you really put a price on democracy? Hmm, I guess I just did, kind of."

5. "All this debating is giving me a headache," complains @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Daft Ideas. "Imagine all the time people would save if they didn't spend the day listening to arguments about tweaking the tax code or giving benefits to old people." He motions over to a window overlooking a lone activist spray-painting 'MAFTAOAL FTW' across @@CAPITAL@@'s main square. "I have an idea, what if we just stopped debating altogether? No meddling politicians, at all. Let the voters decide for themselves."

[b][anchor=761]#761[/anchor]: As Seen On TV [Cazalius lodra; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Classic TV fans have pointed out that the terrible events of the recent @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange bombing were strangely foreshadowed in long-cancelled shlock soap opera [i]"The Light of Day"[/i], sitcom [i]"The Flimpsons"[/i], and in a dozen other TV programs produced by the same media company.

The Debate
1. "Since we're outperforming the Intelligence community, you should make use of our talents!" suggests producer @@RANDOMNAME@@, sensing the opportunity for some great PR. "I figure that we've got our finger so tightly on the pulse of society that we've become psychically attuned to the zeitgeist of tomorrow. That's why subconsciously, our programming content can predict that which your so-called experts are oblivious to. We'll happily send you all our predictions for a small consultation fee."

2. "They're receiving information from elsewhere!" stage whispers @@NAME@@'s lousiest spy, Jason Bouring. "None of our agencies could have predicted the bombings, and I don't think it's likely mere TV producers could have made this string of perfect guesses. They must be in league with terrorists, maybe as spies sent from Blackacre. We must arrest them, and deal with these traitors harshly!"

3. "Don't you think the real problem is that intelligence services that can be beaten by a TV entertainment company?" asks Intelligence Agency Director Abbot Blackbriar. "Counter-terrorism measures need upgrading, and national security services need better funding. With more agents, rigorous training programs and more investigatory powers, we'll soon be better than the best. In fact, you should just assign me a budget, and leave things to me."

4. "The only obvious thing here is that it's all a coincidence," points out mathematician Khethelo Roberts. "There was no reasonable way to predict the @@CAPITAL@@ bombings, and frankly there's no reasonable way to predict terrorism at all. Best thing to do is to strip back security and intelligence services altogether, and give us taxpayers a break!" He yelps suddenly as black-gloved hands pull him into the back of an unmarked van.

[b][anchor=762]#762[/anchor]: Double Down On Double Time? [Australian Republic; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
Turning up one bright Monday morning, you are met with a mob of angry janitors, delivery drivers, security guards and cleaners on strike after legislation for increased weekend pay was defeated for the sixteenth time. Given that all available office space is full of uncollected rubbish and smells faintly of Friday's lunch, a meeting on the issue has been held at a busy local cafe.

The Debate
1. "What do you think they're striking for?" asks a department office intern and student @@RANDOMNAME@@, still half asleep from working weekends at a greengrocers. "Fair wages for antisocial hours, that's what! Do you know how many of us have to sacrifice our free time, our social lives and even our health for the same rate as someone doing a nine-to-five? Big business can afford to pay a bit more, so make them give us night shift and weekend workers extra pay!"

2. "Having to fork out extra for weekend workers would sink us," butts in nosy cafe owner @@RANDOMNAME@@, slinging a sweat-soaked dishcloth at his girlfriend so she can take over. "Me and the old gal have to scrimp and save to pay for staff as it is! Tell you what, you lot cut back a bit on all those wage laws for us small businesses and I might even be able to take the old nag out somewhere nice."

3. "We never used to rush about like this when I was a young'un," interjects old-timer @@RANDOMNAME@@, holding up a queue just to talk to you. "Nowadays no-one seems to have enough time for a cuppa and a chat. Why don't we go back to the good old days when you only had to work on weekdays, and everything closed at five? That'll give us all plenty of time to get to know each other properly, like back when I was a nipper."

[b][anchor=763]#763[/anchor]: Any Body For Science? [The 19th Century; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
A group of @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ scientists have advocated loosening ethical regulations to allow scientists to perform research with live human test subjects.

The Debate
1. "Well, it is certainly difficult to find enough willing volunteers," argues Dr. Nikita Mengele, who slinked into your office dressed in a crisp white lab coat. "Rare conditions such as Brancalandian Burps and @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Habitancy can only be found in a few individuals, and more often than not they refuse to take part in our studies! We need the government to step back and let us researchers decide who should and should not be tested upon, for the sake of medical science!"

2. "Don't listen to her, @@LEADER@@," pleads @@RANDOMNAME@@, directing @@HIS@@ cries towards your potted plant. "Doctor Mengele blinded me with her so-called research! This is what happens when scientists think that they can do whatever they want. Surely you cannot just forget about the idea of consent! If anything, you should require a fully detailed consent form for any kind of medical procedure or treatment. If any scientists don't like it, just take away their funding."

3. "But what incentive would people have?" asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, taking a wallet and syringe out of @@HIS@@ bag. "It's obvious that testing on live subjects is a priceless opportunity, and that is exactly why we should place a price on it! Mandate that all participants should be paid, say, 5000 @@CURRENCY@@ per day while they are undergoing tests. This stops low-rate scientists from going overboard, [i]and[/i] it helps the poor. It's a flawless plan!"

[b][anchor=764]#764[/anchor]: Dude, Where's My Elected Representative? [Nation Of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A recent survey of MPs in @@NAME@@ revealed that only 50% of them actually live in the ridings that they represent.

The Debate

1. "This is a disgrace!" shouts street protester and irate bird farmer @@RANDOMNAME@@, whilst launching some sort of squishy projectile at your front door with a handheld catapult. "How is someone who lives in Northern @@NAME@@ supposed to have any understanding of how people in Southern @@NAME@@ live? My MP lives hundreds of miles away from the good honest folk he's claiming to represent. Frankly, it's an insult to the electorate. The government must force elected representatives to live in the areas they're supposed to represent, or kick them out of office!"

2. "This is a democracy, remember?" argues @@RANDOMNAME@@, who was elected to represent the rural fishing folk of @@ANIMAL@@-by-the-Sea, despite living in @@CAPITAL@@. "I may not live in the rural wilderness right now, though I'll probably live there one day. But that doesn't mean I don't know anything about these places. I mean, I do have access to Kwikipedia, after all! Forcing me to resign is a slap in the face to the good people of @@ANIMAL@@-by-the-Sea and an insult to democracy itself!"

3. "There's always room for compromise," suggests noted centrist politician, @@RANDOMNAME@@, who is known for attending as many government meetings as possible. "Obviously we need to have our politicians be knowledgeable about the areas they're representing, but we also can't deny them a right to choose their own place of residence. How about we instead compel all politicians to educate themselves about their chosen ridings? Force them to study the area's history, culture, and languages and actually spend some time there. Then, test them! Give them an examination to pass to prove they know their stuff! If they fail, then they can't run in that riding. After all, a little bit of knowledge never did anyone any harm."

[b][anchor=765]#765[/anchor]: Don't Judge Me [Eaischpnaeieacgkque Bhcieaghpodsttditf; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
Yesterday, the plaintiff, defendant, and jury in a local court had to wait over five hours before the judge arrived late. Furious over the waste of their day, the jury decided to reconvene this morning and charge the judge with being in contempt of court and criminal negligence of a national position. Some are claiming that there is a scarcity of national magistrates throughout @@NAME@@, and the political establishment is convinced that something should be done.

The Debate
1. "I'm being disgraced!" pleads the judge in question. "The public boos me even though I was on the other side of @@NAME@@ yesterday morning doing another case! The statistics are dire, @@LEADER@@. There are not enough judges for a country of our size, and we're spread too thin. You need to appoint more colleagues for me on the bench. And while you're at it, get me a pardon already."

2. "I agree that more judges should be appointed, but how do we know they are not just motivated by power?" inquires your lawyer while fixing his suit. "Judges should be selected randomly like juries are. The only difference is that those who could be picked should be limited to lawyers and people who actually know how the law works. When a trial needs to take place, nearby people that fit the qualifications can be summoned and chosen from. I'll take an oath that nothing could ever go wrong."

3. "No, no, no, no, no! These are horrible ideas!" wails @@RANDOMNAME@@, a noted anarchist, while burning a judge's robes. "The entire judicial system is an unjust use of brute force to suppress inherent human freedom. Abolish the judicial system and free us from the tyranny you politicians label 'law'."

4. "I say, that blubbering anarchist is on to something here, what!" realizes @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Defense, while toying with @@HIS@@ monocle. "After wrangling unruly cadets, our valiant military officers should have no trouble disposing of court cases in lieu of overworked judges. That way, the courts will be under strict orders from you to do the job properly. And if people complain about it, why, it would be a jolly good workout for me to step and convince them that it's okay." @@HE@@ cracks @@HIS@@ knuckles and grins cheerfully.

5. "You all are not taking this seriously!" foams @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Anger Management, while punching a hole in the wall. "You don't need to change anything. The only thing that should be replaced is that incompetent judge who arrived late! Fire the crook and replace her with someone that actually wants to take the job seriously! I don't care if that means judges can't sleep or eat or whatever it is besides doing their duty to @@NAME@@. Our judicial system is counting on their undying loyalty to the law!"

[b][anchor=766]#766[/anchor]: Carbon Emissions Are Why We Can't Have Nice Things [Continental Commonwealths; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
Signing that international climate treaty all those months ago really put a feather in your cap, and in the cap of @@NAME@@. Stately banquets in Brancaland and numerous editorials on your progressive leadership; it really has been quite delightful. Today, however, a strongly worded letter from the treaty compliance commission arrived at your desk, asking you to detail how @@NAME@@ plans to fulfill its obligations.

The Debate
1. "Well, we always knew this day would come," laments renowned business tycoon @@RANDOMNAME@@. "The important thing now is to ensure that the most business-friendly option is pursued. If we hook ourselves up to one of the established cap-and-trade systems, we can go shopping in the backwater signatory states and buy enough permits to allow @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ companies to continue producing at their current rates. Our industry won't technically reduce their emissions, but it's an 'international' treaty, right?" [color=blue]Must have Private Industry

2. “Well, we always knew this day would come,” laments renowned industry manager @@RANDOMNAME@@. “The important thing now is to ensure that the most industry-friendly option is pursued. If we hook ourselves up to one of the established cap-and-trade systems, we can go shopping in the backwater signatory states and buy enough permits to allow @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ companies to continue producing at their current rates. Our industry won’t technically reduce their emissions, but it’s an ‘international’ treaty, right?”

3. "Let's do this the right way, yes?" suggests @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, avid 'yes-man' and resident of a territory completely devoid of oil and gas. "If you want a tried and true method for reducing carbon emissions, you can't go wrong with a good old fashioned tax scheme. Yes, those territories with larger energy reserves and heavy industry will likely be impacted to a greater extent than those without, and socioeconomically it's bound to be somewhat regressive, but we have to consider future generations. We can offset the damages by investing the revenue in renewable energy and social welfare, yes?"

4. "There's another way", posits Balon Busk, the nation's foremost newspaper columnist on technology and fantasy fiction. "Carbon capture and storage technology has some great potential. Of course, kicking off new tech is always risky, so we'll need massive subsidies for investments in the right infrastructure and equipment. But if we get it to work, we won't need to reduce carbon emissions at all. We'll just put it someplace it won't do any harm and no one is likely to stumble upon it, like deep below the Misty Mountains or something. It's the epitome of eating your cake and having it too! Expensive cake, but still."

5. "This meddling in national affairs is sickening," howls @@RANDOMNAME@@, an energy sector advocate known for @@HIS@@ love of dramatic exaggerations. "Any one of the proposed options will decimate our economy, without having the slightest positive impact on the environment, probably. All the worthwhile companies will flee to more business-friendly jurisdictions, and @@NAME@@ will die a horrible and painful death; that's right, I said it: that treaty of yours will kill @@NAME@@. Who's going to appreciate all those flowers when everybody's dead, huh? Trash the treaty!"

[b][anchor=767]#767[/anchor]: Xe Said, Zhe Said [The Marsupial Illuminati; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
Transgender students at @@CAPITAL@@ University are up in arms after @@RANDOMNAME@@, a noted Sociology professor, refused to use students' preferred pronouns. After being briefed on the minefield of multiple genders and microaggressions, you step outside your safe space to face the masses.

The Debate
1. "By refusing to call me by my preferred pronouns, @@HE@@ is denying my humanity!" cries a spirited student with no clear gender. "@@HE@@ is a transphobic person, using free speech as an excuse to cover @@HIS@@ bigotry. I don't feel safe on this campus anymore because of this. We as a society discourage the use of offensive speech all the time, which is why we don't allow racial slurs on our campus. Why aren't pronouns treated the same way? Misgendering should be a hate speech and those who do it should be fired from their jobs and liable for psychological damage!"

2. "Oh shut up, free speech is a cornerstone of our nation," bemoans the professor in question. "Restricting speech is how most authoritarian and fascist regimes in history began. First they'll come for your ability to use the pronouns you want, and you'll say nothing because you don't want to offend people; next, they'll come for the media! We cannot allow this to happen! I am not a bigot just because I refuse to address a transgender student with a made-up pronoun concocted by radical activists. Besides, I have a thousand students, I can't be bothered to remember a thousand pronouns; I must be allowed to refer to people however I want."

3. "The problem is that our speech allows for such offenses to be had at all," claims @@RANDOMNAME@@, a controversial equality advocate. "I'm not just talking about eliminating gendered pronouns from our language, although that's really a no-brainer, I'm talking about eliminating any sort of possibly offensive descriptors. Adjectives possibly related to race? Gone! Descriptors of different religions? Gone! Racial slurs? Oh man... er, person, are they gone. With new @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ OffenselessSpeak, @@NAME@@ will be paradise."

[b][anchor=768]#768[/anchor]: Trouble Brewing [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
This morning's strategy meeting was brought to a grinding halt when you and your cabinet were subjected to the worst pot of tea you have ever had the misfortune of suffering. The leaves weren't properly brewed, the milk was skimmed AND powdered, the water was lukewarm, and the sugar bowl was full of salt...

The Debate
1. "Oh gosh @@LEADER@@, I'm [i]so[/i] sorry I don't know how to make your boiled leaf water," spits @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@, the ever-sarcastic secretary responsible for the offending brew.  "I was busy learning trivialities like typing, minute-taking, IT skills, and calendar organising.  How about you all drink Eckie-cola from now on, instead?  In fact, you should get rid of tea from the whole of @@NAME@@: it's a drink for old farts and fuddy-duddies anyway."

2. "Look, I'm the Secretary of State, [i]the damn Secretary of State[/i], I say, and even I know how to make tea properly," complains your elderly Secretary of State, pointing to the desk nameplate that says Secretary of State.  "The problem with young people today, well, besides being constantly glued to their Pear Phones, is that they don't know how to slow down and take their time.  We should make tea-making and kitchen skills a part of the national curriculum, and encourage all those teenagers and twenty-somethings to stop rushing around, and to appreciate a proper tea service."

3. "Pfft, slow-mo food and drink is so last century," mocks @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Chief of Science, while digging into @@HIS/HER@@ microwave burrito.  "What you need is instant tea, in a can, with some sort of heating widget that triggers with the ring pull, and plenty of preservatives to make it last.  Once again, science has the answer!  So, shall I assign some government grants for food technology research, or what?"

4. "Oolongs for better tea?" giggles @@RANDOMNAME@@, your pun-loving Minister of Agriculture, and your Cabinet brace themselves for an onslaught of tea-related puns.  "Can we Matcha solution to the problem?  Can we Rize to the occasion?  Did you read that report I Sencha?  Did I get things down to a tea, my Darjeelings?"  In the face of blank faces and silence, @@HE/SHE@@ changes tack.  "Uh... anyway, coffee.  Coffee is easier to make and nicer.  Subsidise coffee growers."

[b][anchor=769]#769[/anchor]: How To Print Money? [Singapore no2; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
An independent study recently estimated that up to ten percent of all physical money in circulation is counterfeit.  The Treasury Department are greatly worried, both that the counterfeiters are still at large and that @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ could be being severely devalued over time.

The Debate
1. "The fake bills just keep coming and coming!" exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, your excitable Chancellor of the Treasury, pouring out a suitcase of the counterfeit notes onto your desk.  "If we want to stop this, I'll need a special task force under my direct control, and a free hand to act decisively...  With that, I guarantee you we'll stamp out all forms of counterfeiting within a month.  Or maybe two.  Or however long it takes!"

[2]. "An easier solution would be to implant small RFID-microchips into our notes and coins," proposes @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Gadgets, demonstrating a prototype to you. "This would ensure that all genuine money could be immediately verified by handheld scanners.  As an extra benefit, it'd be a lot easier to track the movement of cash if we need to." [[color=purple]Must have substantial scientific advancement OR I.T.[/color]] [???]

3. "All that glitters is gold, and really that's all we'll need to know," mumbles @@RANDOMNAME@@, a gold magnate.  "Wouldn't it be much simpler if a 1-@@CURRENCY@@ coin was actually worth one @@CURRENCY@@?  If you used gold coins instead, not only would the coins have intrinsic value, but counterfeiting would become profitless and thus non-existent."

4. "What a boring, utilitarian solution," yawns @@RANDOMNAME@@, an uppity artist, who is currently painting a mural on your ceiling.  "The correct way should be to issue new notes and coins, and adorn them with elegant and intricate patterns.  Not only will they be hard to copy, but they'll look fabulous as well.  Only then will it be difficult for criminals to make a mould."

5. "What's so wrong with individuals making money?" questions a dodgy-looking stranger with ink stains on his hands.  "If the government can print money, then why can't private citizens?  It'd stimulate the economy, I reckon, by creating cashflow and hyperinflating the currency, or something like that.  Hyperinflation is something good, right?  Isn't that what free market economics means?"

[b][anchor=770]#770[/anchor]: Vaping Up A Storm [Kortza; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
E-cigarettes and vaping have been growing more popular, but some have expressed safety concerns.

The Debate
1. "I caught my son puffing mist from this weird device!" panics mother @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, holding an e-cigarette at arms length as if expecting it to explode in her face.  "I haven't tried it myself, but if you combine electricity with the dangers of nicotine, who knows what will happen?  We must stop people using them until there's been more research into their safety!"

2. "Mom, you have like, minus one hundred percent idea what you're talking about," retorts her son, fifteen-year-old @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, obnoxiously exhaling a cloud of berry-scented vapour into your face.  "E-cigarettes have have like, no bad stuff in them at all, so they're as safe to smoke as drinking water.  I mean drinking water is as safe as smoking these, not that you can smoke water... uh... you get what I mean.  In fact, they help people stop smoking.  Which is good, so I hear, though I've never actually tried smoking cigarettes.  Plus, it's really cool-looking.  I've been trying to impress that Julie girl with my vape hearts.  Anyway, don't cut me off, because I really like Julie.  Like really, really like.  You get me?"

3. "Nicotine replacement devices are reasonable to help with nicotine addiction," interjects Dr. @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@ in a paternalistic tone of voice, "and that's all that they should be used for.  People are too stupid to decide things for themselves: you need someone who has a brain to tell them what to do.  @@LEADER@@, if you have any respect for the moral and physiological well-being of our nation, I implore you to necessitate a psychiatrist's prescription for electronic cigarettes."

[b][anchor=771]#771[/anchor]: Drug Up The Prices [Outer Sparta; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
Bletchley Pharmaceuticals recently hiked up the price of Garatim, a once-affordable branded drug used to treat neurodegenerative conditions, to over twenty times its original cost. Sick patients have accused Bletchley of greedy practices, and citizens have begun to take to the streets, calling on the government to intervene.

The Debate
1. "Why is Big Pharma doing this?" shouts @@RANDOMNAME@@, opting to simply throw a megaphone at your secretary rather than speak through it. "I have taken this medicine for decades, but some selfish pharmaceutical firm wants to deny me the care that I desperately need! Am I supposed to spend all of my life savings just so that I can survive? Enough of it! We need the government to oversee all drug prices to keep things fair for everyone."

2. "This is much bigger than a handful of sick people!" rants @@RANDOMNAME@@, majority shareholder of Chant Healthcare, almost spilling the vast contents of @@HIS@@ wallet onto the ground in @@HIS@@ anger. "This is about the free market, and how it drives innovation. Of course we make money off these drugs, but these profits are what give companies the incentive to develop these drugs in the first place! Take away that, and who would ever want to push the boundaries of pharmacological science again? The government should have no hand in this market, for the sake of our nation's health."

3. "The problem isn't price gouging, it's our healthcare system!" protests @@RANDOMNAME@@, a prominent socialist thinker, scowling at the furious businessman. "Solving this problem only eliminates a symptom, not the disease itself. Our healthcare system lets greedy pharmaceutical companies exploit society's disadvantaged. We must seize control of the means of drug production and outright ban private institutions from developing medications."

4. "It's all an elaborate plan!" exclaims Marty Stebeckli, the CEO of Bletchley Pharmaceuticals, revealing a sheet of paper covered in indecipherable text. "You're going to have to trust me here. Raising the price of Garatim was intended to put pressure on private health insurance companies, by forcing them to spend massive amounts for the drug. We're even giving it out for free to people that actually need it! @@LEADER@@, our intentions were pure. Perhaps the government should encourage this behaviour by handing all drug production over to my company?"

[b][anchor=772]#772[/anchor]: Do You Have Artistic License? [Goolsbee; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
Disaster! The organizers of a charity dinner you are attending have been forced to cancel a scheduled stand-up routine by Jerry Fallon, famous comedian and headliner, because he has not renewed his entertainer's license. During the commotion, several of the nation's great and good also in attendance have come to your table to argue their positions on occupational licensing.

The Debate
1. "This shows why we must end licensing once and for all!" splutters @@RANDOMNAME@@, Chairman of the [i]@@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Freer Enterprise Committee[/i]. "I ask you, who do you think is best placed to decide who is qualified? Some stuffed shirt bureaucrat sitting in a comfy office in @@CAPITAL@@ or the employer? Leave it up to the free market to decide! If folks don't think much of a plumber, electrician or doctor then they'll vote with their @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@!"

2. "Don't listen to this laissez-faire claptrap," sneers consumer advocate @@RANDOMNAME@@, discreetly shoveling vol-au-vents into @@HIS@@ pocket. "Occupational licensing protects consumers from incompetence and harm. We should be expanding the scope of licensing! Just look at the shoddy workmanship on these table decorations!"

3. "My children's babysitter doesn't need a license to do a good job, but we obviously need to enforce certain standards for important professions where people's lives are at stake - like doctors," observes Dr. @@RANDOMNAME@@, President of the [i]@@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Medical Association[/i]. "The best way to protect the public and to keep out the riff-raff is to require a letter of recommendation to the licensing board from established and respected associations, such as mine."

[b][anchor=773]#773[/anchor]: Know Thy Selfie [The Grim Reaper; ed: The Grim Reaper][/b]

The Issue
While taking a photo with a journalist, you were interrupted by an enthusiastic supporter who promptly fainted in your arms. The journalist's article went viral overnight, turning the image of you and your fan into an internet sensation. The next morning, you were greeted by your intern, @@RANDOMNAME@@, begging you to take a selfie with @@HIM_1@@ in the same pose. It turns out you've acquired a new fanbase. This raises a question - how can you turn this situation to your advantage?

The Debate
1. "All my classmates are so jealous that I get to work in your office," squeals your intern, gleefully posting the selfie in @@HIS_1@@ blog. "If you started a student organization to help you campaign online, we'd be queuing up to join! The best students are the ones who work hard for their futures. This'd give us another way to start working for yours!"

2. "More publicity means more scrutiny," murmurs your personal assistant, straightening your curtains. "We need to keep your online image squeaky clean. We should keep your public presence where it belongs - pre-prepared teleprompter speeches and draft-by-committee press releases."

3."Woah, that sounds really, really boring," sneers your Chief of Staff, pulling your curtains askew again. "Look, give me some of your social media passwords. I'll dump some opposition research to get your fans really riled up. They'll make short work of anyone who tweets at you the wrong way."

4. "You have all these fans, and you want to manipulate them?" gasps @@RANDOMNAME@@, head of the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Bureau of Statistics and hobbyist street petitioner. "It would be far more valuable to know exactly who supports exactly what policies. With bots to scrape social media for all the hashtags and profiles you'll ever need, you can finally see every citizen the way they want to be seen - as a data point!"

The Issue
It turns out the @@MAN@@ who cleans your office toilets is actually double-qualified as a real estate lawyer and an orthopaedic surgeon. In @@HIS@@ home-country, that is. In @@NAME@@, @@HIS@@ qualifications are not recognised. According to the rocket scientist that makes your sandwiches in the canteen, this is a common problem for immigrants across the land.

The Debate
*1.

Some of their practices might come across as slightly unorthodox, but still: an increase in supply will lead to a decrease in costs, benefiting public spending and private sector growth.

[b][anchor=775]#775[/anchor]: Affirmative Election [Singapore no2; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
Recent elections in @@NAME@@ have resulted in yet another parliament with few racial or ethnic minorities. In response, several minority-interest organizations have been protesting for weeks on end outside your office. The ruckus has become so distracting that you tried to veto your grocery list. After realizing that this couldn't continue any longer, you have decided to give them an audience.

The Debate
1. "This tyranny by majority must end!" demands @@RANDOMNAME@@, a Macronesian protest leader, who claims to represent all 2500 Macronesians in @@NAME@@. "We have been trying to become members of parliament for most of our adult lives, but we have not won even a single seat. I insist that you permanently reserve a few seats for minority groups throughout our nation."

2. "That would not even begin to make up for the decades we spent suffering in silence," laments @@RANDOMNAME@@, an ethnic Moltovean who was unsuccessful in @@HIS@@ last three runs for a seat in parliament. "The current system obviously doesn't work. Why don't we just redraw the voting districts? We can arrange the borders in a manner that will ensure our parliament has a more representative percentage of minorities. Rather than having a few reserved seats, we could actually have fair elections that result in a diverse parliament. Of course, the nation's homogeneous rural areas might need to be, um, divided a little more creatively to allow our people to get elected there."

3. "These dreadful ideas would alienate a large chunk of our voting base," complains Speaker of Parliament @@RANDOMNAME@@, who was recently lampooned in the book [i]Stuff Ethnic @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ Like[/i]. "Furthermore, the proposals are completely unmeritocratic. No matter how much you spin it, if a candidate fails to meet the expectations of the voting public, the candidate does not deserve a seat. And besides, you've seen how those loutish Bigtopians conduct their own affairs. Do you really want those sorts of people in our government?"

4. "The proposed rules don't go far enough!" proclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, a devout follower of a very small sect of Conspiritivism, sporting a tin foil helmet and insulating robes. "If minority races get to have special considerations, it's only fair that we have them too. You should allocate reserved seats in parliament to both ethnic minorities and minority religions to give everyone a voice!"

[b][anchor=776]#776[/anchor]: Fake News, Everyone! [Nation of Quebec; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
Journalistic pieces filled with falsehoods have been popping up all over the internet recently, especially on social media.

The Debate
1. "Lousy so-called 'journalism'!" exclaims the highly intelligent but often forgetful @@RANDOMNAME@@, an aging journalist. "Fake news is a blasted scourge and an insult to real reporters everywhere. Whatever happened to the good old days when the media reported the truth and nothing but the truth? No lies, no political bias, and no freedom to spread incorrect opinions. Of course, it might not reach today's hip young audience, but we can't let subjective thoughts ruin the press. Ban these fake news sites and arrest these ridiculous conspiracy theorists!"

2. "I'm from @@NAME@@, and that's why I deserve my free speech!" rages Alexander Jonas of the controversial show [i]My Info Struggle[/i]. "People should be able to say whatever they want. The truth is, I'm a hard-hitting, fact-seeking, freedom-lover! The government has no right to declare that my journalism is any less valid than the hacks you see on television. People deserve opinions from people that aren't a part of the bureaucratic elite, from independent sources that they can trust. You should be cutting taxes for shows like mine, because the government needs critics to stop corruption dead in its tracks!"

3. "No matter what you decide, someone is going to be unhappy," notes Trevor Oliver of [i]The Weekly Moan[/i], a news satire program. "Allowing fake news spreads ignorance and fear, but clamping down on it harms freedom of speech. You'll note that before each of my shows, there is a disclaimer stating that this isn't real news and shouldn't be taken seriously. Couldn't you simply force the fake news sites to openly state that they're fake? Sure, the government would be able to decide which sites should and shouldn't be coupled with a warning, but the people wouldn't be easily tricked any more."

[b][anchor=777]#777[/anchor]: Betting On The Future [Drasnia; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
During a family dinner, your brother - who is well-known for his fondness for slot machines - bemoaned the fact that his favorite casino was going out of business. The next day, you found out that he has secretly arranged to have several major casino owners meet you in your office.

The Debate
1. Edward Rump, owner of the failing casino, shakes your hand for an awkwardly extended period of time. "There are so many problems for honest businessmen like me. That's what they're all saying. Believe me, the worst is the terrible zoning and property laws in our nation today. The worst. We need to have our casinos in the best places to reach the very very best people. These laws are destroying our nation. Bigly. Without them, it'll be amazing. Only the best, I'm telling you. You'll have so much money, you'll be sick of money."

2. "No, you've got it all backwards," says 'Portly' Pete Russo, board member of the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Gambling Commission, while lighting a cigar. "What's killin' us are those taxes of yours. They're highway robbery! Shift the tax burden from us to income tax and I bet we'd be able to increase our operations and bring in even bigger hauls that'd more'n make up the difference. Seriously, I'll give you two-to-one odds, what'd you say? Anyway we're the lifeblood of the economy, and you wouldn't want to be the one responsible for bumpin' off an industry that nets ya so much dough, now would ya?"

3. Your brother, who has been eavesdropping the whole time through your office door's keyhole, interrupts the group. "How about instead we use tax money to purchase credit for casinos and then distribute that credit to every taxpayer? That way they're basically getting a tax break and there's an incentive for people to try these really entertaining games. Oh - totally unrelated - but could you lend me some money again?"

[b][anchor=778]#778[/anchor]: Mal Appetit! [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Hugh Jass, @@NAME@@'s most famous TV foodie, drew a lot of criticism when he visited a world-class restaurant in yesterday's episode and gorged on expensive gourmet foods in a manner that some viewers found too "appetite-stimulating." Mr. Jass' extravagance was said to be particularly disrespectful to millions of poor @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ citizens who could not afford one of the dishes he ate with their entire monthly salary.

The Debate
1. "How inconsiderate!" exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, a labourer whose love for TV is accentuated by @@HIS@@ square-framed eyeglasses. "While my family subsists on beans and rice, this guy shamelessly sups that fancy pasta and mushroom thing. My children ask why we never eat white Brancalandian truffles. What can I tell them? @@LEADER@@, please ban these TV foodie shows so that our children will not have to grow up feeling self-conscious about our financial circumstances."

2. "Mon dieu!" grumbles Mr. Jass, sniffing his croissant, and throwing it away untouched. "Do these wretched ignorami not recognise the worth of a good [i]tagliolini con tartufo[/i]? 'Pasta with mushrooms' indeed! If these peasants have neither the means nor aspiration to appreciate vicarious high-quality culinary culture, they can simply change the channel. I render a valuable service to our economy by giving publicity to our first-class restaurants. So, how about the government picks up the restaurant bills for our gastronomic journalism? I'll cover the service charge, of course."

3. "Ahem, please excuse Mr. Jass' terse reply. He adores all @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@. I'm sure we can find a compromise," mutters @@RANDOMNAME@@, the producer of Mr. Jass' show, awkwardly fidgeting with @@HIS@@ gold watch. "Rest assured, we can arrange to cater for the needs and desires of our under-resourced viewers. Perhaps you could incentivise Mr. Jass to show that he understands all his demographic, and should occasionally visit more affordable restaurants. What do you say?"

4. "This is pathetic," sneers Robin Wood, an advocate for equality, picking up the extra croissants on Mr. Jass' plate and tossing them out of the window to the huddled masses who anxiously await your decision. "These poor, benighted workers fail to question why they are unable to afford these fancy foods in the first place. It's because of this hideous income inequality! @@LEADER@@, redistribute our great nation's wealth and give a standard salary to everyone, no matter their job! No more, no less!"

[b][anchor=779]#779[/anchor]: We're Dying For Your Business [Pigeontree; ed: Ransium & Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A recent exposé of the death care industry revealed that funeral costs are leaving some families dead broke. The reason for the price increases is thought to be because while population growth continues to rise, funeral parlour growth has stopped cold, resulting in shocking cases of price gouging. Demand for last rites has become so high that families sometimes have to pawn all of the deceased's possessions just to afford a simple burial.

The Debate
1. "Dying is not something we have a choice in," weeps a sombre woman dressed all in black. "The tragic death of a loved one followed by an astronomical bill landing on our doorsteps can put families' finances in a death spiral. I urge you, @@LEADER@@, to scrap death charges altogether and provide state-funded funerals for everyone. That way families won't have to mourn their bank accounts as well as their loved ones."

2. "Yes, and do you know why there's a shortage of funeral services, hmmm?" quietly seethes funeral director Igor Fronkensteen, while dragging a lumpy burlap sack behind him. "Burial plot land costs...they are rising, yes? The price of insuring a hearse these days is, how do you say, absolutely ludicrous, yes? And the restrictive laws on 'adequate refrigeration' and 'treating the dead with dignity' all are running our margins and my salary down! You want more funeral services at a cheaper price, you should ease up on the bureaucracy, yes?"

3. "Funeral services? What a waste of money," scoffs obscure thinker @@RANDOMNAME@@, who has yet to sell any copies of @@HIS@@ book [i]Rich Dead, Poor Dead[/i]. "What's the point in some drawn-out shebang for someone who's not even going to be around to see it? Do away with funerals altogether. That way we can cremate everyone and harvest their bodies for phosphorous!"
