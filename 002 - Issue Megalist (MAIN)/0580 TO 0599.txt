[b][anchor=580]#580[/anchor]: @@NAME@@ Taking Leave Of Its Census? [Zwangzug; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue 
When the latest National Census asked citizens to specify everything from their shoe size to number of sexual partners, leading privacy activists and the casually paranoid started raging that the process has become too intrusive and that the anonymity of the respondents is at risk. 

The Debate
1. "Enough, I say!" melodramatically rails Warren Brandeis, while angrily doodling crude images of the male anatomy in every tick box on the census form. "With this level of detail, any hope of anonymity and personal privacy will be but a distant whisper. Why should we trust the blasted establishment to know every single detail of our lives, let alone where we live? I have no intention of entrusting the government with my full demographic profile, and I implore anyone with a shred of decency and respect for the sanctity of the domestic sphere to opt-out of this Orwellian intrusion!"

2. "Nonsense!" counters @@RANDOMNAME@@, policy wonk at the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Bureau of Statistics, dotting the i's and crossing the t's of an essay question. "Without accurate and meticulously detailed census data we'll be completely lost! How can we make informed decisions when there's no information? How will we know what areas of the country to target with our... welfare programs? No, we need to have greater authority to make sure everyone is filling out the census!"

3. "Yee-haw, pardners," strums country-music star @@RANDOMNAME@@. "No need to bring out the big guns there fella, I'm sure these fine folks would be just gosh-durned happy to fill out all of your ticky boxes, if you get them in the right mood. Let me and my friends churn out some songs advertising the glories of checking boxes, and you'll have them lining up to submit all the data you want in no time! To make sure they really, really get the message, you should make all them medias play our hearty honky tonk exclusively during census-time! Now ain't that a peach?"

4. "Let's be reasonable here," suggests @@RANDOMNAME@@, manager at 'Surveys R Us', while wielding a sharp pair of scissors. "Me and the gang can trim down and freshen up the census for you - a slice here, a dice there - and make it into something so feel-good and inoffensive that nobody will object to answering it. Granted, the results will have to be a bit more, eh, let's say 'aggregated', but I'm sure the boys at the Bureau will manage to make somewhat informed and semi-relevant estimates nonetheless."    

[5]. "Do we really need a national census anyway?" yawns @@RANDOMNAME@@, a meme-analyst at social media site MyFace, who is using the form as a paper airplane. "It's a lot of trouble for nothing, if you ask me. If you want to know where someone lives or what their spiritual animal is, you add them on MyFace like everybody else. Why spend a lot of money doing an official census, @@LEADER@@, when you can easily set up a profile with us and just add everybody?" [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

[b][anchor=581]#581[/anchor]: Fair To Say...? [Unibot III; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
At last year's World Fair many said that @@NAME@@'s exhibition pavilion was "okay, considering,"  and "not bad, for a nation on a tight budget." This year, national organizers want to make your expo presence bigger, better, and more impressive than ever before. 

The Debate
1. "We need more shiny stuff! We need lasers, and twenty-foot-tall robots!" squeaks General @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ Honda, hoverboarding excitedly round you in a wide circle. "Let's show off our tech to the rest of the world! We need flying cars and… and… cyber@@ANIMALPLURAL@@! Yes, a cyber@@ANIMAL@@, with a frickin' laser beam on its head!"

2. "My, how gauche!" sneers Martina Amis, an esteemed novelist. "Culture is the lifeblood of @@NAME@@. We should create a gallery-slash-library to celebrate @@NAME@@'s arts and literature abroad. Nothing less could represent our brilliance."

*3. "Give the fair-goers what they want! FOOOOOOOOD!" yells Adam Richbloke, generously-proportioned foodie holding a generous portion of battered chicken chunks. "Visitors to the fair aren't going to visit every tent: you know how many nations there are in the world now? But everyone has gotta eat! Chocolate donut lasagna, deep-fried pancake soups and orange truffle crabcakes with butter, pork and loads of sweet custard. Hmm, hmmm, hmmm, looks like everyone will be stopping by the @@NAME@@ pavillion!" [[color=blue]Must not be vegetaria[/color]]

*4. "Everyone likes tofu, don't they?" suggests frizzy-haired vegetarian @@RANDOMNAME@@, offering you a mug of tofu-and-cress soup. "We should be pushing out the vegetarian agenda with a 'Wonders of Tofu' celebration. Tofu-desserts, tofu-lasagne, tofu-coffee, tofu-with-extra-tofu... Is there anything that tofu can't do?" [[color=red]Must be vegetarian[/color]]

**5. "We're glossing over a real opportunity here," says Carla Marks, a vocal advocate for global Communism. "Across the world, citizens are suffering in poverty and being oppressed by the capitalist miser-nations. This is our chance to give Communism a voice on the global stage, and to use that voice to point out the sickening excesses of neighbouring nations!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

**6. "I smell economic opportunity," says your Commerce Minister @@RANDOMNAME@@. "We should showcase what a great place for investors we are, emphasising our flexible taxation arrangements for valued corporate investors and our latest moves to stamp out the unions. We should literally get on our knees, and beg the biggest businesses to bring jobs and prosperity to @@NAME@@." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

[b][anchor=582]#582[/anchor]: Augmented Reality Check [Enthusiasm; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue 
Following the release of hit mobile game Maxémon Woah, which requires players to walk around in order to find mythical creatures, many of @@NAME@@'s pedestrians have been hit by unseen vehicles in an effort to snatch 'em all.

The Debate
1. "These are needless tragedies!" complains your concerned Public Safety Minister, angrily smacking your phone out of your hands, and denying you the ultra-rare Lenyutwo you were about to snatch. "Hundreds of people have already been hurt and we had our first death just last week, all just to get some virtual monster thing! I won't begin to get into all the trespassing charges that have been filed!" She continues her tirade as you pick up your phone and manage to snatch a Slowbrophyllia Raticalia. "This game is a disaster waiting to happen! At the very least, prohibit the use of the game within urban areas."

2. "Not even then are we truly safe!" preaches @@RANDOMNAME@@, a belligerent religious leader who previously accused you of colluding with demons. "That 'game' is nothing short of the work of the damned, what with the conjuring of cyber demons in our beautiful nation! Have you even looked at a Sedgetoise? It's clearly modeled after the devil, and the Amorlax represents a forbidden depiction of the archangel! Did you know that you have to evolve them? In the name of all that is holy, forbid this Maxey-Pokey-Heresy!" 

3. "Ah, the game is just some harmless fun," retorts @@RANDOMNAME@@, the director of the Barrysonian Museum of Political History. "Ever since we started advertising as a Maxéstop, we've had record attendance. Our visitors have been putting aside their differences to catch their Gnejgars, Sleepypuffs, and Clefrissies. In fact, we really ought to be using this game to get people interested in politics and history again. Start putting Maxéstops and Maxégyms at archives, museums, and educational centers. Maxémon will bring everyone together, provided you're on Team Insightful of course."

4. Out of the corner of your eye, a teenager wearing a bright red tracksuit and visor climbs in through your window. "Absolutely we should encourage people to play, and make sure it's safe for...wait a second..." He swipes his phone, not having looked up since he entered. "Sorry about that. I'm Dash Snatchum, and in order to be the very best, I gotta divert all of my attention! You should just make a whole lot more stop signs and streetlights so we can get to those Noqorans and Charchivemanders faster! After all, you gotta snatch 'em all!"

[b][anchor=583]#583[/anchor]: Don't Be A Busk-Kill [Oisinistan; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
A recent video shoot of newly sworn-in cabinet ministers being broadcast on live TV was disrupted by an enthusiastic but loud vuvuzela-player busking nearby. Most viewers reported they couldn't hear a word being spoken over the noise. This incident has raised some smiles, but also sparked a debate over busking in general.

The Debate
*1. "NOISY PESTS!" yells inner city resident @@RANDOMNAME@@, straight into your left ear from just two feet away. "While I'm trying to get my beauty sleep at 3 in the afternoon, I'm being disturbed by moronic musicians, talentless thespians and hopeless harlequins! They're just beggars, but with added irritation and noise. Ban busking! Lock up these feckless fools!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color] AND [color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

"While I'm trying to get my beauty sleep at 3 in the afternoon, I'm being disturbed by moronic musicians, talentless thespians and hopeless harlequins! They're just beggars, but with added irritation and noise. Ban busking! Smash up their instruments, and take away all their earnings!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color] AND [color=blue]Must not have prisons[/color]]

*3. "NOISY PESTS! DECADENT IMPERIALISTS!" yells inner city resident @@RANDOMNAME@@, straight into your left ear from just two feet away. "Not only are these moronic musicians, talentless thespians and hopeless harlequins disturbing the peace, they are doing so for filthy capitalist motives! They're just profiteers, but with added irritation and noise. Exile these feckless fools from our beloved nation!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "Eish! Em not justa musician, mos," protests @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, the busker in question, "Em a one-man entertainment experience, with Hlokoloza dancing for the bokkies an' gooses, befok naartjie juggling and even face painting for the laaities! Surely busking adds a bit a music and colour to life, nè? The government should pay buskers to be on every street. Let's make everyone's life happier now now!"

5. "I know a way we could make both sides happy," remarks your Minister for Fine Arts, @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, pressing play on her cassette of patriotic anthems to create the right mood. "We could introduce national performance licenses, and only allow public performance by those who have attained a certain standard. As a nice side effect, this will let us make sure that our nation's culture is both highbrow and patriotic."

[b][anchor=584]#584[/anchor]: The Cake Is A Lie [Felucian Planetary republic; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
In recent weeks, a neighbouring nation in @@REGION@@ released a controversial and gory movie about @@NAME@@, entitled [i]The Baker Of @@NAME@@[/i]. The movie, which follows the horrifying journey of a hapless ex-baker into the criminal underworld of @@CAPITAL@@, seems to imply that @@NAME@@ is a dystopian hellhole filled with violent crime. Unsurprisingly your citizenry is offended. 

The Debate
1. "This movie makes us look like lawless bloodthirsty savages... and they claimed we eat @@CAPITAL@@ Cakes all year round, when everybody knows that we like @@CAPITAL@@ Scones these days!" complains scowling patriot Marshall Kim J. Unn, dousing a stack of movie promotional posters in kerosene, tossing the offending nation's flag onto the pile, and lighting a match. "Not only should we ban this evil slanderous movie, we should also demand an apology! Deploy tanks along their border, and warn them to withdraw the film, or face the consequences."

2. "Woah, like chill out dude, get a sense of humour,"  says satirist Sacha Sagdiyev, lighting a spliff from the bonfire. "These people just don't know what it is actually like to live here. So, why don't we show them? Get some tourists in, get them high on magic mushroom muffins, flood them with love. Getting angry never solved anything, man."

3. "Lies and videotape, eh?" muses Lenny Groovesteel, your Propaganda Minister, reading a psychology article on [i]The Triumph Of The Will[/i]. "Two can play at that game. We should direct our own movie directors to churn out some counter-information, singing our nation's praises and fabricating something nasty about theirs. Have you heard people talking about the disgusting Dog-Hair Muffins they bake? No? We will fix that."

[b][anchor=585]#585[/anchor]: Are You Not Entertained? [Socialist Nordia; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue 
Last weekend, a roller coaster malfunction at Six-hundred Flags Theme Park resulted in dozens of people left hanging upside down from stationary carriages for almost half an hour and one passenger injured badly from the fall after she released her own safety harness to get down. Outraged by a perceived lack of safety, concerned parents are now pushing to have something done about the dangers posed by amusement park rides.

The Debate
1. "MY CHILD COULD HAVE DIED ON THAT THING!" vents overprotective mother, @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@. "And the mess... vomit in his hair was the least of his problems: he's always had weak bowels, poor thing. These roller coasters are clearly a danger to the public. Not to mention that people actually waste money on those godforsaken things. I say we ban them right away, along with any other rides that could put my baby boy at risk."

2. "That's a little excessive," concludes your uncle, @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, while attempting to child-proof your office. "When properly regulated, amusement park rides pose no danger. So the only reasonable thing to do is to hire a lot more health and safety inspectors. That way tourists can visit our nation's rides and restaurants without fretting about their own safety."

3. "That sounds like a waste of money," says @@RANDOMNAME@@, director of the infamous amusement park, after literally taking candy from a baby. "This was totally an isolated incident that in no way reflects upon my park's safety or popularity. I can't believe people are panicking so much over a couple of broken ribs and a snapped neck. Everyone knows that necks naturally repair themselves. Let me reopen my park tomorrow, and I'll have all the ride malfunctions fixed. Eventually."

4. "Woah, so cool!" opines wannabe daredevil @@RANDOMNAME@@, who appears to be improvising a motorcycle out of scrap iron and kerosene. "The only thing cooler than feeling like you're on the brink of death is actually being on the brink of death. Just scrap all those lame safety rules so we can get some real excitement! Super dangerous, but that's just part of the thrill, man."

[b][anchor=586]#586[/anchor]: School's In For Summer? [Aipotu Ruo; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue 
Your Education Minister recently proposed abolishing the traditional @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ school schedule, which included seasonal breaks, and replacing it with one in which school days were evenly distributed over an entire year. In response, concerned administrators, parents, and educators have asked for your support.

The Debate
1. "Everyone knows how much time parents and educators waste regurgitating the same information every year," complains obnoxious parent @@RANDOMNAME@@, seen wearing a 'My Child Is An Honor Roll Student' button. "Students often forget things when they spend long periods of time without learning. In order for these young minds to flourish, we should keep the same number of weeks of education per annum, but spread them out evenly across the year. That will make my - I mean, @@NAME@@'s - children's successes even more pronounced!" 

2. "That is ridiculous. Can you even imagine all the overhaul that would require?" questions principal @@RANDOMNAME@@, after giving two of your squabbling aides a time out. "The budget is strapped enough as it is! A better solution would be to allow each school to determine its own schedule. That's better for the administrative workings of this public school system, and our finances. Besides, educators need breaks too! Teaching those little hellions is far more stressful than it looks!" The aides begin squabbling again, prompting a stern glare from the principal. "You two! My office! Now!"

3. "Restructuring alone won't keep our children ahead of the curve!" opines @@RANDOMNAME@@, Comptroller of the @@CAPITAL@@ District School Board who had been grading everyone on their posture and speeches. "What we need to do is make education free and mandatory all year round, fifty-two weeks a year and six days a week. Yes, that means massive spending towards the education budget, but you can't put a price on knowledge. Well, I guess you can depending on how much goes into the budget."

The Issue 
Last week, a humanoid robot announced its intentions to serve as a the nation's first android federal judge. Concerned citizens have come to you as to the implications and legality of this potential appointment.

The Debate
1. "Surely we cannot allow this, right?" asks Chief Justice @@RANDOMMALENAME@@ while curling the end of his beard around his finger. "Letting them vote would be one thing, but robot judges? What if it malfunctions or someone tampers with it? We need to put an end to this right now. If we manufactured it, it shouldn't be allowed to serve in the judiciary."

*2. "He's a – it's a WHAT?" yells @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Zero Tolerance. "This robot had to be made by someone right? You don't see how that could go horribly, horribly wrong? It's clearly a power grab by someone with deep connections at the Friendly Robot Company. We need to conduct a full on investigation of the entire industry and this robot; who made him, who paid for him, what he is capable of – the works!"

*3. "He's a – it's a WHAT?" yells @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Zero Tolerance. "This robot had to be made by someone right? You don't see how that could go horribly, horribly wrong? It's clearly a power grab by someone with deep connections at the Friendly Robot Company. We need to conduct a full on investigation of the entire industry and this robot; who made him, who paid for him, what he is capable of – the works!"

4. "If I may disagree," politely asks iCroft Holmes, the robot nominee. "A robotic judge has numerous benefits that the esteemed gentlemen are deliberately omitting. We can view decisions in a rational and analytical manner, unburdened by emotions. We would make decisions for the betterment of the people. The judiciary would become streamlined and efficient. Surely, these are virtues the government wants?"

**5. "I warned you!" scolds noted technophobe @@RANDOMNAME@@ after smashing your telephone. "But no one would listen. You became dependent on these soulless machines, integrated them into every facet of your lives, and look, now they dare to judge us! We've got to rid @@NAME@@ of these toasters once and for all! Ban artificial intelligence and bring some sanity back to our country!"

[b][anchor=588]#588[/anchor]: Last Call For Alcohol? [The Dalatian Republic; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue 
The @@CAPITAL@@ Police Department has reported an upsurge in alcohol-related crime in recent weeks, with bar-fights, vandalism, and street violence all on the rise. Now, with a drunken city councilor involved in a street brawl with an equally drunk Brancalandian ambassador, it is perhaps time for you to intervene in the embarrassing levels of booze-fueled mayhem.

The Debate
1. "These pubs are cesspools of crime and delinquency!" rages Temperance League founder and avowed pacifist @@RANDOMNAME@@, throwing a bottle full of perfectly good beer on the floor, smashing it. "And don't forget the broken families and long-term health problems associated with drinking yourself to death! The government must ban all alcoholic drinks and shut down every last bar in @@NAME@@ in order to safeguard public safety."

2. "Maybe just a selective ban? After all, beer doesn't get you drunk nearly as quickly as whiskey or vodka," proposes @@RANDOMNAME@@, who has the difficult job of cleaning up all the messes in the Surly Wench Pub. "Just set an upper limit of 6% ABV. That way people still have a way to blow off steam, but they'll be a little less likely to smash bottles or brawl over the @@ANIMAL@@ball game."

3. "I can do... what I want... with my body," staggers @@RANDOMNAME@@, who is already drunk at 10 in the morning. "The government should just get off my... back." The sot abruptly falls down.

[b][anchor=589]#589[/anchor]: To Boldly Go? [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
As the government prepares for its latest budget, the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Space Agency is looking for direction from you. Petitioners have been transported to your office to present their ideas.

The Debate
1. "We should seek out new life and new civilisation," implores William Kirk, an elderly utopian SF author and astronomer. "There are trillions of stars, and it's mad to believe Earth alone harbours intelligence. There might be alien green-skinned lovelies, just waiting for contact with a real man. We need telescopes and exploration probes, aimed at the second star to the right, and straight on till morning. Show some enterprise. See what's out there... That-away."

2. "They call it a space race, but being first at any cost is not always the point," suggests reformist politician Patrick Picard, looking suspiciously at five lightbulbs illuminating the room. "Attend to the small details at the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Space Agency. Are they assimilating all the men and women needed, in an equal and fair fashion? Sometimes a counsellor can be of as much value as a pilot." He takes a sip of hot Earl Violet tea. "I may be accused of being overly methodical, but these things matter. Suspend launches for now, and attend to infrastructure. Make it so."

3. "Space, I regret to say, is a dangerous place," offers gruff base-commander and part-time gourmet chef Avery Sisko. "It's not just about science, nor about being an emissary for corporate profits. It's about security. Near-Earth space is getting crowded, with a multitude of nations seeking absolute dominion. You don't want the East Lebatuckese to get any further with their space program, do you? Who knows what they're doing up there with that Sputnak satellite? We need a new kind of space ship, to show our defiance of those agendas. One with guns. Lots of guns."

4. "Is anyone else here kind of bored?" yells young tearaway William Kirk Jr., revving his motorbike as he rides into your office, in clear contravention of rules and regulations. "We gotta make space exciting again for people, make the old things new again! Not just dry data and lore for tech-geeks, but awesomeness for ordinary people who like explosions, and lens-flared sunsets, and stuff like that. Reboot the Space Agency! Let's have firework displays, televised low orbit skydiving, and celebrity astronauts with great hair! I dare you to do better!"

[b][anchor=590]#590[/anchor]: When Trees Hug Back [Czechostan; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue 
With a significant portion of deaths in @@NAME@@ stemming from people simply getting lost in the vast wilderness, a debate has commenced on the merit of having such an expansive and bustling environment.

The Debate
1. "Seriously, the trees are out of control, man," complains aging hippie @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, while wrapping a warm blanket around his cold feet. "Look, I love Momma Green as much as the next guy, but there are literally trees and foliage everywhere! I can't even see the street from my house, and this morning I was nearly mauled to death by a pack of saber-toothed @@ANIMALPLURAL@@ when I went on a trek to retrieve my mail. Can't the government lay off on a few of the environmental regulations and stop declaring anything with leaves a national park? You know, at least let me mow my lawn, man."

2. "Okay, so some people are getting lost in the woods," remarks Minister of Environmental Affairs @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, a bureaucrat so grey she makes pavement look like the Technicolor Dreamcoat. "Don't blame nature for human error. Give my department some increased funding, and I'll have the Rangers go out and discreetly mark some safe trails between our major population centers." She ogles your shriveled potted plants with cold, dead eyes, and says: "You know you're required by law to water those bi-daily, right?"

3. "Behold! What we are witnessing is the twilight of modern civilization and the grunge of industrialization," declares aspiring primitivist @@RANDOMNAME@@, clothed solely in @@A(ANIMAL)@@ pelt, while stretching both arms upward and revealing two miniature valleys of woodland. "I read somewhere that before the emergence of states and industrialism, everyone lived peacefully in small, egalitarian, cohesive societies. We're almost there again, and to ensure that everyone can truly live and die among the roots and vegetation of nature, we must begin the complete deindustrialization of @@NAME@@. It'll sound terrible to some, sure, but don't knock it til you try it." 

4. "Talk about missing the point!" coaxes @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, known biophobe and CEO of an all-but-destitute wood-chipping and mining firm, 'Tree's Company, So Mine Your Own Business'. "The rising percentage of people dying in the wilderness is proof that man and nature were never made to interact beyond the shaft of an axe or a shov…" He pauses mid-sentence, face turning wan and frozen at the sight of your potted plant. After regaining his composure, he continues in a high-pitched voice: "Eh, where was I… Yes, that's it! Abolish all green regulations and spending, and allow the eager lumberjacks and miners of @@NAME@@ to access forest and field so we can fight back and civilize the environment! Trees will always grow back, and surely the hippies at the Ministry of Environmental Affairs can't demonize a few subterranean rocks being removed?" [[color=blue]Must have Capitalism[/color]]

[b][anchor=591]#591[/anchor]: Bait And Switch [Lenyo; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue 
Children wept today, as only a handful of fish showed up for the 'Dance of Salmon' – an eagerly awaited tradition celebrating wild salmon migration from the ocean to the riverbeds of @@NAME@@. Experts and deep-sea anglers have pointed fingers at the abundance of open-net fish farms dotting the coast, which allow sea lice-infected farmed salmon to contaminate migrating wild salmon, threatening the very survival of the species.

The Debate
1. "Salmon are a crucial link in the food chains of both the ocean AND river systems!" asserts @@RANDOMNAME@@, a surprisingly knowledgeable 10-year old, clutching a tear-drenched plush salmon. "The wild stocks of both Maxtopia and Blackacre are already irreparably depleted by sea lice and overfishing, and if we do nothing, @@NAME@@ is next. You need to severely tighten regulations for the farm barons: make them clean up their act before it's too late!" 

*2. "What's the worst-case scenario? They're extinct in twenty years or so? I'm eighty-six; I'll be extinct in ten," reasons ridiculously wealthy fish farm owner, Bjørnar Laksekonge. "This is really making a mountain out of a molehill. Look, if you just equate wild salmon with caged salmon in your government counts, I think you'll see the problem disappearing overnight. I'm sure my boys can train a couple of our fish to swim upriver once or twice a year, nobody will care: a salmon is a salmon, right?" [[color=blue]Must not have Geronticide[/color]]

*3. "What's the worst-case scenario? They're extinct in twenty years or so? I'm fifty-five; the government will make sure I'm extinct in ten," reasons ridiculously wealthy fish farm owner, Bjørnar Laksekonge. "This is really making a mountain out of a molehill. Look, if you just equate wild salmon with caged salmon in your government counts, I think you'll see the problem disappearing overnight. I'm sure my boys can train a couple of our fish to swim upriver once or twice a year, nobody will care: a salmon is a salmon, right?" [[color=red]Must have Geronticide[/color]]

4. "People, people! Let's forget about the salmon for a while and talk about the lice!" pleads @@RANDOMNAME@@, disgraced marine biologist and amateur chemist. "The louse - scourge of the salmon, free or farmed; wouldn't it be nice if you could just make them go away? Well, you can! I've been working on a new type of pesticide targeting just this kind of situation. It's still experimental, that's for sure, but if you let fish farmers douse their tanks with my stuff I'll guarantee that your lice problem will be a thing of the past, all while keeping your fish nice and sound. Actually, I'm not 100% sure about the fish, but the lice will definitely die!"

[b][anchor=592]#592[/anchor]: Infamy! Infamy! They've All Got It In For Me! [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
Two days ago a series of pipe bombs in @@ANIMAL@@ City killed two people and injured twelve more. By yesterday morning, the news was full of pictures of the perpetrator, with reporters explaining his twisted manifesto and giving the terrorist's ideology far more exposure and media presence than he could ever have achieved without violence. Like many others, you find yourself watching an evening TV program dissecting the events of the last few days. 

The Debate
1. "Boy, am I glad they caught that monster?" asks chat show host @@RANDOMNAME@@ hopefully rhetorically, just after airing a thirty minute segment profiling the killer. "Now... some on this panel were saying earlier that having his face and picture all over the airwaves was counter-productive. I disagree! We're showing the public that crime doesn't pay. It's in the public interest, because... uh... because the public is interested! It's also about history, and recording events for posterity. That means it's actually the [i]duty[/i] of the media to put up the names, faces, methods and manifesto of these ratings-boosting psychopaths."

2. "With that haircut, I'm surprised YOU aren't the one we're condemning," jokes fellow panellist @@RANDOMNAME@@, to thunderous audience applause. "In all seriousness though, it's not right that we're playing right into this terrorist's hands, spreading his message of hate and making him a celebrity. People died, man! We should have an enforced code of conduct, asking the media to be responsible in reporting. After all, publicising an agenda of hate is the same as promoting it. Consign these killers and their whack-job thoughts to the oblivion of history where they belong."

3. "Why don't you all shut up and go home?" yells a heckler from the audience. The camera pans round to show an angry red-faced fellow with a cooking apron on. "I had tickets for [i]Celebrity @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Bake-Off Factor Live[/i], and then they tell me that it's been cancelled to make room for this stupid show. Hey, @@LEADER@@, if you're watching, ban this sort of news and documentaries, and keep TV for what it was made for... Entertainment!"

[b][anchor=593]#593[/anchor]: A Right to Bare Arms? [Escalan Corps-Star Island; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
Despite a conservative attitude towards nudity in @@NAME@@, recent analyses of fashion trends suggest that women's sleeves have been getting progressively shorter in the last few months, sometimes to well above the elbows. Outraged moral guardians have come to you to ask for nationally enforced standards of dress.

The Debate
1. "This is outrageous!" wails @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, founder and chairwoman of the conservative activism group Modicum Of Modesty. "@@LEADER@@, everyone knows that increased promiscuity among young girls can be directly linked to the square footage of skin showing! Sexual abuse, objectification and falling educational standards are all direct consequences of nudity: I have the statistics and evidence, from a study that my own organisation completed! I beg you, mandate conservative skirts and long-sleeved blouses. A lady's wrists and ankles should be covered!'

2. "Don't listen to that harridan: she's got ugly arms, and that's why she wants to hide," scoffs @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, a teenage student at one of @@CAPITAL@@'s rowdiest schools. "Look, I don't get over-excited every time I catch a glimpse of shoulder or thigh. I mean sure, some people take it a little too far, but shouldn't that be their responsibility? She can cover up if she wants, but prettier girls should be able to show a little skin."

3. "I think we all know what's going on here," chides popular feminist speaker @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@ as she bashes the previous speaker over the head with her protest sign. "We hear stories of assault and abuse, and it's chalked up to be the girl's fault for wearing something that 'invites it'. This is a clear case of double standards – nobody ever says anything when a man rolls up his sleeves to get to work. We need to change the mentality that holds women's clothing choices to blame for the actions of men. We should be able to walk down the street naked if we want to, and not be blamed or shamed from doing so."

[4]. "Since when have we let the women of this country determine its morality?" rages traditionalist @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, his wife and daughters standing behind him in fearful silence. "A woman's nakedness is for her husband to behold, and for none other. All women should be forced to cover themselves head-to-toe while in public, and should not venture out of the home without permission. They should obey their husbands or male relatives in all things, including their clothing choices." [[color=blue]Marriage is legal[/color]]

[b][anchor=594]#594[/anchor]: Tie Fighters [Drasnia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The national election is over and election officials are painstakingly counting every vote. The results are expected to be close and one electoral district, @@ANIMAL@@ Valley, has already seen a tie. The incumbent, cabinet minister Jennifer Nike and her challenger, Violet Utopia each amassed exactly the same number of votes. The candidates have already begun fighting, both with each other and with election officials at the Electoral Commission of @@NAME@@, prompting the first major debate of the new political session.

The Debate
1. "@@LEADER@@, as the incumbent for @@ANIMAL@@ Valley I believe I have the right to represent it again," demands Mrs. Nike after arguing with a nearby election official over whether an 'X' or a check-mark constitutes a spoiled ballot. "Precedent should always be given to maintaining the status quo, and officials should not be deposed or replaced except by a two-thirds majority. That'll give us some political stability, and give you and me a chance to get things done."

2. "@@LEADER@@, I demand a re-vote!" exclaims the increasingly paranoid Violet as she meticulously reviews paragraph forty, subsection two of the Election Code, which deals with re-votes. "We all know how corrupt this government is. I swear your goons have been stalking me! We need to hold a new election for the district. If the results are within 10% of a draw, then we'll keep on holding re-votes until I, uh, someone wins!"

3. "As always @@LEADER@@, I have the perfect solution!" declares your gambling addict brother who makes life decisions by the roll of the dice. "Why not have tie votes determined by a coin toss? It's simple, fun, and doesn't show any favoritism. We could bet on the outcomes and even apply the same principle to the legislature!" He then takes your prized antique ancient golden Maxtopian coin and flips it. "Fifty @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ on tails!"

[b][anchor=595]#595[/anchor]: Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes? [Saint Emygdius; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
A high profile case where a police officer used lethal force against a criminal suspect that he claimed "posed immediate danger" has the populace divided. Some claim he was defending himself in the line of duty, others that he was abusing his power. Lack of witness testimonies or evidence is making investigation difficult, and many are suggesting that the government should outfit all of its police force with camera equipment to record events as they transpire.  

The Debate
1.  "Cameras. Cameras would be good." intones Patrol Officer and jungle war veteran @@RANDOMNAME@@, twitching nervously and scanning the skyline for rooftop snipers. @@HE@@ takes a moment to look a thousand yards into the distance. "People don't know what we've seen. They don't know what it's like to wear this uniform, to be a target, to know that each patrol might be the last. I know war, and it's war out there on the streets. If people could see what we have to deal with each day... they'd understand. Give me a camera, and I'll show them what it's like out there."

*2. "Look, I'm not saying I don't trust our fine police officers," whispers transparency advocate @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ Juvenal, carefully moving any weapons and sharp objects away from the tremulous police officer, "but cameras are needed not just to support police testimony but also to protect the public from police excesses. The only way they can serve that dual purpose is if the police don't control the cameras. Have 24/7 cameras on every police vehicle, surveillance drones following cops on patrol, all the footage streamed live on the internet, and stored on an open-access cloud. That way, we can keep an eye on those jackbooted th... uh... on our valued law enforcement officials." [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

*3. "Look, I'm not saying I don't trust our fine police officers," whispers transparency advocate @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ Juvenal, carefully moving any weapons and sharp objects away from the tremulous police officer, "but cameras are needed not just to support police testimony but also to protect the public from police excesses. The only way they can serve that dual purpose is if the police don't control the cameras.

That way, we can keep an eye on those jackbooted th... uh... on our valued law enforcement officials." [[color=red]Must not have internet[/color]]

4. "Bwaahh?!?" exclaims moustache-twirling driving-goggle-wearing charlatan @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, who was definitely not trying to tie your secretary to his toy train tracks. "Police with cameras? This is a breach of my civil liberties! What about privacy? Do we not have the inherent right to go about our daily, lawfully abiding lives without fearing these paparazzi pigs parading our precious picturesque moments to the putrid public as perfidious publications? Say no to copper cameras! Keep your eyes off my private business!"

[b][anchor=596]#596[/anchor]: Primogeniture Problems [Nuremgard; ed: Lenyo][/b] 

The Issue 
Due to the reigning monarch's lack of heirs, which could conceivably cause a succession crisis, the aristocratic elite have begun to question the ancient law of primogeniture.

The Debate
*1. "I'm the eldest child, so I should get the throne!" shouts Princess @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@, who has a reputation for being completely undiplomatic. "It doesn't matter that I'm a woman. I should have the same rights as a man to the throne. Why should the crown pass over me because of my genitals? It's arcane! I mean, having a monarchy is arcane too, but never mind that..." [[color=purple]Must be a patriarchy[/color]]

*2. "I'm the eldest child, so I should get the throne!" shouts Prince @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, who has a reputation for being completely undiplomatic. "It doesn't matter that I'm a man. I should have the same rights as a woman to the throne. Why should the crown pass over me because of my genitals? It's arcane! I mean, having a monarchy is arcane too, but never mind that..." [[color=purple]Must be a matriarchy[/color]]

**3. "Don't be so preposterous!" splutters dusty old courtier @@RANDOMMALENAME@@ as he pulls out an even dustier family tree of the royal family which trails on the floor. "Generations of proud, strong kings have ruled this land with conviction and certainty! That's why the country has done so well for so long. It's clear that women should not be allowed to succeed the throne. They're much too emotional. Besides, do you really want the Princess meeting other heads of state when it's her... time of the month?" He shudders. [[color=purple]Must be a patriarchy[/color]]

**4. "Don't be so preposterous!" splutters dusty old courtier @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@ as she pulls out an even dustier family tree of the royal family which trails on the floor. "Generations of proud, strong queens have ruled this land with conviction and certainty! That's why the country has done so well for so long. It's clear that men should not be allowed to succeed the throne. They're much too emotional. Besides, do you really want the Prince meeting other heads of state? Women think with their heads and hearts; men think with their..." She shudders. [[color=purple]Must be a matriarchy[/color]]

***5. "We need a radical reshaping of our country's power structure!" bellows crazed usurper @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@ as she brandishes a blade at the terrified male courtier's privates. "For too long the patriarchy has oppressed us and denied us our natural rights to rule! Abolish primogeniture and ensure that only women may inherit the throne! We shall usher in a golden age of feminine supremacy!" The courtier shrieks as she accidentally cuts his trousers in excitement.
 [[color=purple]Must be a patriarchy[/color]]

***6. "We need a radical reshaping of our country's power structure!" bellows crazed usurper @@RANDOMMALENAME@@ as he brandishes a blade at the terrified female courtier's décolletage.

The courtier shrieks as he accidentally cuts her frock in excitement. [[color=purple]Must be a matriarchy[/color]]

****7. "All this nonsense about succession has got me thinking," says @@RANDOMNAME@@, esquire, who is 456,789th in line for the throne. "Does the monarchy actually serve a purpose anymore? Seems to me that it would just be cheaper to not have a head of state at all. Royalty mostly exist today for photo ops, anyways." [[color=purple]Must be a constitutional monarchy[/color]]

****8. "All this nonsense about succession has got me thinking," says @@RANDOMNAME@@, esquire, who is 456,789th in line for the throne. "Do we really need an expensive, reality-deficient monarch to tell us how to run our lives? Seems to me that it would just be cheaper to not have a head of state at all."

[b][anchor=597]#597[/anchor]: You Can't Handle The Tooth [A Humanist Science; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue 
A few days ago you needed triple root-canal surgery, and despite your codeine-enhanced prescription you're still in agony. However, your dentist has refused to prescribe anything stronger! You're now back for your check-up, wondering if it's time to think about relaxing the regulations around the most powerful painkillers.

The Debate
1. Dr. @@RANDOMNAME@@, your personal dental care professional, sits down on a stool next to you, and lowers the back of the chair to the horizontal. "Open, please? Good. I'm sorry @@LEADER@@, but you know the drill. Easier access to narcotics will only lead to more widespread abuse. In reality, many pain 'patients' are just junkies looking for a fix. The primary purpose of medicine is to cure disease, not to enable addiction! Instead, consider adjusting healthcare policy to stress cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, and other non-pharmacological interventions. Spit, please?"

2. "ummm**HUUURP**..uh, yuck," says Dental Nurse @@RANDOMNAME@@, who you know is also a spokesperson for Patients Against Interdicting Narcotics, while emptying a recently-soiled emesis dish into the medical waste sluice. "Yeah, that's precisely the wrong thing to do. Insufficient treatment of pain is very common, especially among women, ethnic minorities, and the poor. The elderly are also at risk, since many wrongly think that pain is just a 'normal' part of aging. The most severe cases can even drive people to suicide! Medicine should focus on quality of life, not just curing disease. Do the right thing, and ease restrictions on powerful painkillers now!"

3. While you're still supine, a strange pale-skinned man shines the dentist's lamp directly into your eyes and begins loading a large metal syringe from an unmarked vial. "I have your solution right here, dear leader. Why not add these powerful painkillers to the water supply, under the banner of a new healthcare initiative aimed at relieving stress and improving quality of life? Then you can use mass addiction to control the population! A particular district doesn't like your new absolutist platform? Just reduce their 'pain relief' until they do! Imagine the whole populace desperately begging you for another hit!"

[b][anchor=598]#598[/anchor]: A Violet Trojan Horse [Crazy Girl; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue 
Rumors tell that the Order of Violet has infiltrated schools in @@NAME@@ to brainwash the youngest generations. Fears of Violetist takeover have prompted all other faiths to unite for the first time ever.

The Debate
1. "Preposterous!" dismisses @@RANDOMNAME@@, the head of the @@CAPITAL@@ District School Board, while hiding an Order of Violet signet ring. "Our schools are performing well, and the children are merely learning to understand different points of view. The only hatred I see is from the hypocrites and paranoid kooks who have no problems forcing their values on our innocent children."

2. "Terrorists! Terrorists everywhere!" shouts @@RANDOMNAME@@, a controversial and xenophobic politician, who inevitably tries to win every debate by claiming all opposing views equate to supporting terrorism. "Screen all teachers, headmasters, and aides for possible Violetist ties. Force the schools to adopt an unapologetic pro-@@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ curriculum. We all know these Violetists hate everything @@NAME@@ stands for! Anyone who disagrees is a terrorist-sympathizing, Violetist-loving, traitor!"

3. "That doesn't go far enough," claims the leader of The Tranquility of Yellow, an ancient religion that has a just as ancient feud with Violetism. "These heretics have been a danger ever since the Grand Schism, and they must be dealt with accordingly. I suggest we start up an inquisition. My people will find these Violetists, and see if they can be converted to our true religion or renounce their faith. Whichever one the government prefers. We're not picky. If not... the stake. BURN THEM ALL! Or hang them. Just get rid of those creepy Violetists, okay?"

4. "What are we? Barbarians?" queries popular agnostic speaker @@RANDOMNAME@@, whose personal motto is 'Question Everything'. "I don't see anything wrong with teaching Violetism. Not every Violetist is some crazed wacko, you know. However, schools should teach all different faiths, including non-belief, in a neutral and understanding way in the interest of fairness. If we want to eliminate hatred, the schools are a good place to start."

[b][anchor=599]#599[/anchor]: Dead In The Water [Aculea; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue 
Massive fertilizer-fueled algae blooms in the South @@ANIMAL@@ Sea are quickly depleting aquatic oxygen levels and suffocating marine life. Vaguely aware of this fact, you are on a poorly-planned fishing trip in the South @@ANIMAL@@ Sea arranged by the Ministry of Agriculture. The fishing expedition is intended to impress foreign dignitaries, but you can't help but notice that there are more strategic locales for a PR stunt, areas that aren't a sickly brown color. All the same, you cast a line into the water, and a few seconds later the fishing rod bends and flexes wildly.

The Debate
*1. "That must be a big piece of garbage. There's no way you'll catch any fish in that dead water." concludes @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, an unabashed nihilist and CEO of DrillBabyDrill. She jabs a finger at the open sea, adding, "This proves that it's high time to give up on environmental regulation altogether. If you want to squeeze some more production from this pool of filth, abolish those obsolete pollution laws hindering my offshore oil rigs. There's nothing left to protect, after all." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. "That must be a big piece of garbage. There's no way you'll catch any fish in that dead water." concludes @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, State Director of National Oil. She jabs a finger at the open sea, adding, "This proves that it's high time to give up on environmental regulation altogether. If you want to squeeze some more production from this pool of filth, abolish those obsolete pollution laws hindering my offshore oil rigs. There's nothing left to protect, after all." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

3. A hard pull on the line drags the rod out of your hands. @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, a retired senior captain from Something Fishy, makes a diving catch for it and wrestles with whatever is on the other end. He exclaims, "If that's a fish, we must find out how it miraculously lives in lifeless water!" He continues to struggle with the fishing rod. "But if it's only trash out there, then the only way to save the fishing industry - and the environment - is to strictly limit the fertilizers causing this dead zone in the first place."

4. With a wrench and some salty language, the captain lands the 'fish,' a woman in a scuba suit. Floundering on deck, she fumes, "Aggh! I can't see anything down there, with all that gunk from the estuary! Rumor has it there's shipwrecks down there, but I've never seen one. Look, the problem here is chemical fertilizer run off from farms, so why not fix the problem back at the farms with better chemicals? Oblige the farmers to add chlorine bleach to the water supply in proportion to the fertilizers they use, and your rivers and seas will boast crystal clear water!"
