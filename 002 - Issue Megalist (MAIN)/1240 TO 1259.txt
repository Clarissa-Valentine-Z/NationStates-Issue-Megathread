[b][anchor=1240]#1240[/anchor]: Unadmirable Zeal [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The theocratic nation of Sacerdia has long been embroiled in war with one of its neighbors, and recently that neighbor has forged a strategic alliance with Blackacre, a global superpower that your nation has always had somewhat unfriendly relations with. Fearful that this will tip the balance of power against them, Sacerdia is seeking an alliance with @@NAME@@, offering multiple favorable trade deals that would bring billions to the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ economy, and long-term access to its territory for the establishment of strategically-valuable @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ military bases. The nation's staunchly religious policies and culture, however, are a stark contrast to your nation's avowed secularism.

The Debate
1. "This is an offer we can't refuse!" exclaims your giddy Minister of Foreign Affairs. "Sure, the Sacerdians might be a little nutty in their religious beliefs, but the people they're fighting have promised to 'wipe @@NAME@@ off the map', or so their ambassador tells me. Not to mention that if Blackacre is expanding its influence in that region, we ought to as well! I think we can hold our noses and help them out even if it means compromising our beliefs just a little."

2. "We can work together, but only on a conditional basis," replies your Minister of Secularism, resting @@HIS@@ feet on a stack of Sacerdian holy books. "If they want our help, they need to start making some changes to their way of life. Tell them that the price of our assistance is transitioning to a secular government that respects the right to non-belief. Sacerdia is surrounded by other theocracies and fascist states, so we need to take this opportunity to instill our @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ and democratic values into the region."

3. "And you think that cesspool of a nation is going to abandon its deeply held delusions overnight?" scoffs one of your foreign policy advisers while rolling @@HIS@@ eyes. "We're talking about a nation that publicly executes anyone who speaks out against their religion! Their government is a lost cause — we should be helping out their people. Fund anti-theocratic dissidents, and create an underground railroad to help atheist Sacerdians escape their country. We have a moral responsibility to undermine religious tyranny."

[4]. "Bah! Who cares about some despotic hellhole in the middle of nowhere?" dismisses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the top commanders in the military. "Sacerdia and its equally noxious neighbour states lack nuclear weapons, so we can just blast the whole region back to the Stone Age with no risk of retaliation. The world will breathe easier without all these fanatics troubling it!" [[color=red]Must have WMDs[/color]]

[b][anchor=1241]#1241[/anchor]: Return Statement [Autonomous Cleaner Bot Cleaners; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Following the trial, conviction, and permanent deactivation of Kyle Hughman, notorious bit-serial killer and cyber-@@DEMONYM@@, Hughman has been sighted on the streets of @@CAPITAL@@ once again. Investigators soon learned of a peer-to-peer internet server that hosts cyber-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ backups to be restored upon news of the original's death. A panicked public is calling upon you to Shift+DEL the problem once and for all.

The Debate
1. "Cyber-@@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are innocent until proven guilty, like any other @@DEMONYM@@," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Justice. "But what does justice even mean if the duly convicted can escape punishment like this? I propose legislation that mandates that all artificial intelligence be converted to copy protected memory, in effect, making all AIs mortal. This will ensure that all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are equal in the end."

2. "This is outrageous! Why should law-abiding AIs be limited in this fashion?" retorts Jonathan 5, noted cyber-doppelganger. "That's right! Just think of all the economic and societal advantages our ability to instantly self-replicate provides!" adds Jonathan 6, from your office doorway. "Indeed, personal autonomy and reproduction are basic buccarian rights that everyone deserves — including AIs," adds Jonathan 8 from the water cooler. "And let's be clear here, while doppelgangers are copied from the same template, if the copy is made before a crime is committed, then that mind-state can't be held culpable for that crime," concludes Jonathan 314159x10^26 via your email inbox.

3. "The way I see it, a murderer has escaped justice through technological chicanery," complains Chief of Enforcement @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If someone commits a capital crime, then all of that individual's iterations should be deleted, no matter how long ago they were made. We can deploy some sort of hunter-killer algorithm and terminator robots to track down and delete copies of convicted felons. It might sound harsh, but deterrent-based punishments can only work if the penalty for crime is suitably severe."

4. "Why keep the death penalty at all?" asks Gloritron HALred, Cyber-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ rights attorney. "This incident just further illustrates the ineffectiveness of retributive justice. Far better and more effective approaches include cognitive behavioral debugging, for example. Violence originates in faulty programming, not faulty @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, and compassionate solutions should be the GOTO 10 of the day, for both electronic and organic offenders."

The Issue
Free-runners and urban-climbers have taken to the internet to post photos of themselves performing gymnastic feats in ridiculously dangerous places, such as atop the highest spire of @@ANIMAL@@ Castle, or on skyscraper radio aerials hundreds of metres off the ground. Last week — while carrying out a rooftop backflip that he would have described as routine — one of them lost his footing and fell to his death.

The Debate
*1. "Kids are foolish and impressionable, and they'll do anything to get famous," lectures paternalistic security guard @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Give them warnings, and they just nod their heads, then come back the next evening. The only approach that will work here is zero tolerance: punish trespass into dangerous areas with a jail sentence." [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

*2. "Kids are foolish and impressionable, and they'll do anything to get famous," lectures Community Rehabilitation Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Give them warnings, and they just nod their heads, then come back the next evening. The only approach that will work here is extended therapy. Clearly, these look-at-me tendencies stem from being denied their mother's breasts during weaning, leaving deep psychological scars. We must fix these poor broken children!" [[color=blue]Must not have prisons[/color]]

3. "Anyone stupid enough to risk their life in this way is not going to be hard to outwit," suggests smug chemical engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I've recently made considerable advances in the fields of hyperallergenic anti-climb paints, near-frictionless surface coatings, and anti-trespasser automated tasers. Give me a budget, and I'll make your cities unclimbable."

4. "Hey, this is MY life, and MY choice!" says a voice from above you. You look up to see a teenager hanging upside-down from your chandelier. "You want to do something for urban climbers? Well, it's hard to concentrate on climbing while having to look over your shoulder for security guards. Make the outside of any building a public byway, and it'll be safer all round."

5. "So these kids do this because they want to be famous on the internet, right?" observes the inevitable technophobic nutter that always seems to turn up to these debates. "If you ban the internet, then no more problems, right?"

[b][anchor=1243]#1243[/anchor]: Kicking Back [Verdant Haven; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
A month-long investigation has revealed that an alarming number of judges across @@NAME@@ have been accepting kickbacks from private prisons in exchange for sending inmates their way. In many cases, the perpetrators would normally have been let off with a warning or a fine, but it appears they have been sent to prison strictly to line the pockets of the parties in question.

The Debate
1. "The problem is as clear as day — these judges are corrupt and must be punished!" roars the warden of @@INITIALS@@CI Inc., a private prison near @@CAPITAL@@. "As soon as private prisons like ours were introduced, they came sniffing around demanding payouts, and threatening to bankrupt us if we didn't play ball. We're the real victims here! Get rid of the bad judges, and I promise things will go much more smoothly."

2. "The problem is as clear as day — these private prison companies are corrupt and must be shut down!" hollers Judge @@RANDOM_NAME@@, banging @@HIS@@ gavel authoritatively. "As soon as private prisons were authorized, they came around with envelopes full of money, slipping bribes everywhere they could, trying to corrupt the course of justice! I saw many of my colleagues tempted by that cash, and I suspect some of them gave in... but not me, of course."

3. "The only reason this happens in the first place is because judges can control where a convict is sent!" declares @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ D. Umbledore, your Undersecretary of Unpredictability. "We need to randomize this process. Place the names of all the prisons in @@NAME@@ into a sorting hat, and have each convict draw one when sentenced. Whatever they draw — that's where they go. The hat will clean up this corruption!"

The Issue
After their successful moon landing, Dàguó astronauts have removed your nation's flag from the satellite's rocky surface and replaced it with their own.

The Debate
1. "Damn Dàguó doofuses, dropping in where they're not wanted!" complains border control officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, attempting to find the landing site through a small telescope. "Give us the say-so and we'll put out a warrant for these vandals! If Dàguó doesn't extradite them, we'll just have to prosecute them in absentia."

2. "How can you expect one lonely flag to survive undefended?" wonders astronaut @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We need a more permanent base on the moon to keep these Dàguó latecomers out. All it'll take is a few @@CURRANCYPLURAL@@, lots of oxygen, and an electric fence."

[3]. "Do you realize how much that would cost the taxpayer?" panics business executive @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ props @@HIS@@ feet up on your desk. "Subsidize private businesses to further refine space weaponry, and we can deliver a much more efficient approach. A missile or two should remove the pesky Dàguó flag." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

4. "H-h-hold on, @@LEADER@@," stutters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Cowardice. "Don't we have more than enough problems to handle on our own planet? You should publicly congratulate Dàguó on their technological breakthroughs, and politely ask their ambassador for the flag back."

[b][anchor=1245]#1245[/anchor]: Sheepish Students [Baggieland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A school in the tiny village of Piddleton, that lies in a sparsely populated and mountainous district of @@NAME@@, has just enrolled twenty-four sheep from a nearby farm as students. The inability to fill the student number quotas mandated by the Local Authority — that help to keep schools financially viable — would have otherwise meant the closure of the school.

The Debate
1. "What other choice did I have?" bemoans School Headteacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ points out the village of Piddleton on a map to alleviate everyone's curiosity. "This is the only school in Piddleton and it has served our community well for generations — the next nearest school is a two hour commute away. In a village of our size, these quotas are impossible to fill. You cannot allow local governments to impose these restrictions on any school, especially in rural districts."

2. "I've heard that in Ausblic they combine classes in rural communities, for example putting students from grade five and grade six together in one class," recalls Junior Education Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It will require a slightly looser attitude to national curricula and standardised teaching, but I'm sure we don't need to be too didactic. Although, in the case of this school in Piddleton, they might have to combine grades one to twelve."

3. "How much are we going to fork out for schools with only a handful of children in them?" complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, governor of the Locality Education Board, pocketing a one-@@CURRENCY@@ coin @@HE@@ has spotted on the floor. "If schools can not fill their student number quotas, then quite simply it is not economical to continue financing them. Close these schools down and the little tykes will have to get their education in the nearest town."

4. "Let's not be too hasty though," adds First Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who heads the devolved government of the district. "All you actually need to do is step back, and give more power to devolved governments to finance their own services. For example, it'd be very useful if we were able to control industrial, income and sales taxation in our devolved areas. Keep funds out of the hands of central government and put it in the hands of responsible devolved districts — we'll soon be able to fund Piddelton School, as well as other projects of local importance."

5. "These sheep are so cute and fluffy," coos second-grader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ presents you with a scarf made from @@HIS@@ classmate's hair. "I love studying with sheep, they help me to study better. Every classroom should have sheep in them, or goats, or cows."

The Issue
Scientists have successfully revived the long-extinct feather-bellied @@ANIMAL@@ to the point where a population of the creatures can be sustained in the wild. The nation's leading wildlife experts and @@ANIMAL@@ enthusiasts have offered their suggestions on how @@NAME@@ should handle these animals.

The Debate
1. "We can't upset the balance of nature!" proclaims Mipha @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, Chief Veterinarian at a national park in @@NAME@@, while feeding the fish in your office. "These animals haven't been around for more than a hundred years. Who knows how they'll react to their new surroundings? It could cause a total shift in the food-chain and the entire ecosystem. We should maintain their population in controlled environments — like preserves, research centers and zoos."

[2]. "I know how to deal with this," states Revali @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, a renowned hunter, who deftly grabs one of the office fish and nails it to the wall. "If you're worried that too many of these animals would disrupt the ecosystem, then allow us hunters to take care of the problem. It would be a phenomenal experience to track down creatures that nobody has seen in generations and tourists would flock to @@NAME@@for the thrill of the hunt. All in the name of the balance of nature, of course!" [[color=blue]Hunting @@ANIMAL@@ is legal[/color]]

3. "Instead of tampering with nature, why not just let it be?" proposes Daruk @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, an animal rights activist. "We have proved that we have the power to bring these species back to life, but now they need to be left alone in peace. Release these animals into the wild and let Mother Nature take her course. Be a friend of the environment, not the master of it."

[4]. "These animals should be used for the benefit of all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@," asserts farmer Urbosa @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, as he herds a flock of sheep around your office. "What a waste it would be to release them into the wild — they belong on farms! Imagine all that they could do for us, and the gourmet foods that we could make with their juicy, succulent meat!"

[b][anchor=1247]#1247[/anchor]: Suspension of the Disbelieved [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A patient accused Ward Nurse @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ of an inappropriately intimate physical examination, which resulted in his suspension from duty at @@NAME@@ Central Hospital. A series of investigations and legal meetings followed, involving hospital management, the patient ombudsman, the complaints review board, and eventually a magistrate's court of appeal. All in all, the nurse was suspended for a total of nine months before the complaint was dismissed and he was fully exonerated.

The Debate
1. "There's no protection for the reputation of professionals anymore," rants the accused nurse, waving a loaded syringe around as he speaks, spraying an unknown sticky white fluid in your face. "My name was in the local paper! The girl I was dating dumped me! Look, of course we must allow complaints. However, once a complaint has been dismissed, we should be able to take false accusers to court to hold them to account. I want compensation for my losses, one way or another." He leers disturbingly with this last statement.

2. "Why doesn't anyone believe me?" sobs @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the complainant who levelled the allegations, as she surreptitiously peels an onion under the table. "For the sake of victims everywhere, you have to weigh in to protect people like me. Do you know how scary it was for me to come forward with this? You owe it to patient safety to trust the word of victims, and to permanently suspend perverts like this nurse!"

3. "As far as I can see, this whole problem has happened because it's one person's word against another," observes your Minister of Watching Watchmen. "We ought to enforce some transparency to medical proceedings, with every professional accompanied by a trained observer for all interactions, and each patient also encouraged to bring their own chaperone. That way, there'll always be at least one impartial observer to verify witness accounts."

The Issue
Last week, your aides scheduled a meeting between you and a renowned former states@@MAN@@ of @@NAME@@. Unfortunately, due to @@HIS@@ long-standing battle with Alzheimer's disease, the meeting left something to be desired, bringing the once-forgotten issue of dementia treatment in @@NAME@@ back into the spotlight.

The Debate
1. @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, the states@@MAN@@ with whom you met, expresses @@HIS@@ concerns to a nearby aide, whom @@HE@@ appears to have mistaken as being in charge. "Once upon a time, I would have been running this @@TYPE@@, but now I'm... I'm... What was I saying? Oh yes: Some folk like me might need day centres, and help round the house. I'm fine, but what I wouldn't mind is more attractive nurses like that cutie over there." @@HE@@ winks in your direction.

2. As @@HE@@ leaves, the aide @@HE@@ was talking to rolls @@HIS@@ eyes. "Surely it can't fall to @@NAME@@ to give people like @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@ handouts. If these old farts haven't planned for inevitable cognitive decline, that's their fault. Cut all aged care funding, and if people can't manage — well then, I guess it's just too bad."

3. "Hang on, hang on. Whatever happened to having a caring family?" interjects your aunt, who is herself advancing in years. "When I was young, we used to care for our parents through thick and thin! This country needs more reinforcement of the traditional family values, which means the young loving and caring for their elders. We should make the elderly legal dependants on their children, to make them pay their parents back for raising them."

4. "Y'know, there's another solution to this problem," whispers your ever-present Minister for Creative Solutions, sharpening a straight razor on a whetstone. "These people aren't contributing to our economy, so why don't we make a few government cuts, if you know what I mean." @@HE@@ waves the blade menacingly.

The Issue
High-ranking state official @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ recently invested a lot of money into a multi-million @@CURRENCY@@ @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ company operating out of the United Federation, a notoriously capitalistic and wealthy nation. Varying socialists and revolutionaries are stating that this is a clear example of capitalist corruption within @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "Since when is it a bad thing," ponders @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, "to make some business connections?" @@HE_1@@ pets the spotted feline curling up against @@HIM_1@@. "When in the Federation, do as the Federals do. It's in the best interests of @@NAME@@ to foster camaraderie with our overseas allies.

3. "This shows that our state has been deeply corrupted from the inside!" monotonously chant ten students clad in red bandanas who have suddenly run into your office.

All who have any ties to bourgeois-reactionary groups must be disenfranchised and violently removed from power.

Unfortunately, the individual making the needed cuts made a botch job of it, lopping off a bit of flesh and giving @@LASTNAME_1@@ a nasty infection. The celebrity is now using his influence to call into question safety standards around circumcisions.

The Debate
1. "Praise be, I don't regret seeking circumcision," winces @@LASTNAME_1@@, fresh from the set of his latest movie [i]Cut to the Point[/i]. "However, I mistakenly assumed that a priest offering circumcision would have some sort of professional qualifications. It turns out all @@HE@@ had was an old, dog-eared urology manual and a pair of kitchen scissors!

2. "Look, it was a tricky procedure on a difficult individual. Anyone could have misplaced their cut," grumbles circumcisionist Britt Miller, gesticulating forcefully while holding a pair of scissors. "There wasn't much size difference from the infants I normally work with, though babies wail and wriggle a lot less.

The Issue
Seemingly with nothing better to do with their time, the Ministry of Statistics has conducted a study profiling the most prolific @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ serial killers and murderers. They have determined that the vast majority of the perpetrators tend to be sexually frustrated single men.

The Debate
1. "The problem is that these unfortunate men are being denied entry into the sexual marketplace," posits controversial University of @@CAPITAL@@ professor Peter Jordanson while stroking his goatee. "Women are humiliating these men with constant rejection. Is it any wonder that they snap? If you want to stop mass violence, we need to have government-arranged marriages and enforced monogamy, so that these men have loving wives who put out and take care of them. Do this, you'll surely see murder rates drop."

2. "You're surely not going to listen to this misogynistic drivel, are you?" scoffs renowned feminist speaker @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "It's not women who are the problem, it's men who think they are somehow owed sex! If you want this problem to go away, we need to start teaching our boys things like respect, consent, coping with rejection, and the inherent emotional immaturity of men. If men still can't see the problem, well, there's plenty of psychiatric institutions with available rooms."

3. "I think maybe our report isn't being taken as a whole," drones Ministry Statistician @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ in a dull monotone. "Correlations with lack of sexual satisfaction exist, but there's also low educational attainment, social isolation, childhood trauma, association with sexually deviant communities, lack of stable employment and the Hervey Cleckley 'Mask of Sanity' to consider.

A local brewery provided the Mayor of @@ANIMAL@@ City with 120 free kegs of their famous ale: @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@'s Blood — usually a year's supply — as has been the tradition for many years. However, the current mayor has consumed the lot in just two months and taxpayers are now being asked to replenish the provision.

The Debate
1. "I know this makes me look like a drunk, but I assure you I'm not," pleads Mayor @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, as she touches her nose with her finger to prove her point. "I host a lot of diplomatic parties and my guests expect a certain level of hospitality. Just last week, I was hosting the Smalltopian ambassador and his entourage, and those Smalltopians can drink! You must replenish the mayoral supply — think of the diplomatic embarrassment of dry events."

2. "We have to pay for their booze now?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a social activist, who is always scrutinising politicians' expenses. "What if she drinks the whole lot in another two months? Will the suffering taxpayer have to continue to fund Her Worship's excesses? If politicians can't go five minutes without a drink, then they're not fit for office.

Top fertility clinics in the United Federation — an ultra-capitalist nation that you nonetheless have historically amicable relations with — have recently announced a new service allowing parents to create so-called 'designer babies'. This is something that is not currently offered by state-administered hospitals in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "I honestly don't see what the big deal is," says Ambassador @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, proudly showing you the ultrasound image of the designer pregnancy she purchased while posted to the United Federation. "I simply made sure that the little comrade will have the very best genetic make up that my partner and I could offer. That should be the right of every couple in our proud nation — boost the health budget so that everyone can choose to have the perfect baby!"

2. "This technology stands as a testament to the deep-seated moral corruption of the United Federation's ruling class," opines @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a senior member of the Party Committee on Ethics. "Notice how it effectively annihilates anyone who doesn't conform to the capitalist ideal of optimally profitable workers? And who are we to say that the discarded embryos do not deserve an equal opportunity to be born and to flourish? Embryonic screening should be outlawed, and anyone who travels abroad to undergo these procedures should be duly prosecuted.

3. "Optimal workers, you say?" inquires @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your minister of health. "That raises an intriguing idea: what if, rather than making genetic profiling freely available to all parents, we made it mandatory? Imagine, we could have a whole new generation of genetically-engineered workers that are ultra-productive and inclined to obedience to the state, with an enhanced ability to contribute to the greater good of @@NAME@@!"

After all, we deserve our share. These are free samples, yes?" @@HE@@ helps @@HIM@@self to a bag of crackers, and walks out.

[b][anchor=1255]#1255[/anchor]: This Lady's Not for Turning [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Maggie Starkers — renowned multimillionaire, genius weapons designer and party-loving socialite — has always been somewhat eccentric and free-spirited. At a press conference this week, she revealed that she was the creator and pilot of a cutting edge flying exo-skeleton weapons system she calls 'the Iron Lady'. The military are keen to get their hands on this technology, but she doesn't want to share.

The Debate
1. It's mine and you can't have it!" asserts Ms. Starkers, taking a swig from a bottle of milk and standing proudly before a coiled-rattlesnake flag. "I built this near-indestructible nuclear-powered mobile firepower war machine, and I reserve the right to fly it around the city centre, blowing up criminals and people who I think are bad guys! You can't take away my stuff! I'll only sell it if I choose, when I choose and to who I choose, and frankly, I don't trust the state to be handling ordnance this powerful."

2. "Look, we need these weapons. If Maggie's not selling then we really don't have much choice," says Air Chief Marshal Uther Scargill. "Seize her designs, seize her assets, seize all her technology. She needs to be reminded that it's the people who are in charge, and that the needs of society are greater than the desires of the individual."

3. "Let's find a reasonable balance here," negotiates civil servant Mandy Rin. "Failing to respect private property is wrong, but Ms. Starkers still has to observe aviation regulations, munition control laws, trading restrictions and the like. I suggest you tie her up in bureaucracy until she agrees to strike a fair deal with us."

4. "Maybe there's a better way to make this work," suggests eye-patch wearing spy Jules Windu, walking in dramatically five minutes after you thought the meeting was over, during what your younger staff call the 'post credits debriefing'. "How about you let me build a special operative team — we'll call it the Vengeance Justice Initiative. The Iron Lady, Dogman, Superhulk, Ex-Husband-of-Colour and all the other special people with special talents... we'll call them to assemble when we need them, and let them get on with their lives the rest of the time. Oh, and I'll need a helicarrier. Don't ask why, just get me one."

[b][anchor=1256]#1256[/anchor]: Train in Vain [Australian rePublic; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
It's election time in @@NAME@@, and the Treasury has allocated a measurable chunk of the budget to build a rapid transit line in the highly marginal seat of @@ANIMAL@@ City, much to the dismay of the residents and MPs of safer seats.

The Debate
1. "When are you going to provide some funding for us?" queries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Member of Parliament for the safe seat of Greenville. "Here are the plans for the ski-lift that was promised to be built in my town, but never was. Where did the funding go? To @@ANIMAL@@ City, again! To make things fair, every constituency should be allocated equal funding."

2. "We need that new metro," reminds @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@ANIMAL@@ City's MP. "How else will I... I mean, tourists get to the North Beach area? We're a tourist resort and tourism is important to the economy of @@NAME@@. You should put more financing into infrastructure to attract more visitors to my constituency, and that puts money in the pockets of the voters. You wouldn't want to lose the next election now, would you?"

3. "I have an idea!" eagerly suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your minister of Creative Solutions, whilst drawing pieces of paper out of a hat. "The blue paper is a piece of infrastructure, and the pink paper is a seat. See — aqueduct, Greenville. Hospital, @@CAPITAL@@. Stadium, @@ANIMAL@@ Hills. All decisions made by the hat are final. There'll be no more fighting, and we can all finally get along in Parliament!"

[b][anchor=1257]#1257[/anchor]: It's a Kind of Magic [Podium; ed: Altmer Dominion[/b]

The Issue
A shocking archaeological find in one of @@NAME@@'s many caverns has led to the discovery of a huge array of pre-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ totems, idols, and assorted knickknacks made entirely of stone, many of which gave researchers 'the heebie-jeebies'.

The Debate
1. "This is a fascinating opportunity for the scientific community as a whole!" spouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, breathlessly running through @@HIS@@ brick-thick pile of notes and results. "Our initial tests are already showing a stunning reading of anomalous energy in each and every one of those artifacts! If we could be permitted to, erm, [i]acquire[/i] them, this mysterious power source could be the backbone for future @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ technological advances! Think of the societal possibilities!"

2. Pushing the scientist aside, your mustachioed military adviser @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ grips at a manila envelope entitled 'TOP SECRET'. "That's all fine and dandy, but what if we used this 'anomllalus' energy to power our weapons? These days, everyone's raring to get bigger and better guns, and we need to make sure ours are bigger and better than everyone else's! If we get those magic rock thingies, I'm sure my eggheads'll make something out of it!"

3. "Hold on a moment!" shouts physicist @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Feinmann, frantically tying a leaded apron around @@HIS@@ waist. "Something feels off about this whole matter, and it's not a strictly metaphorical sensation. I'm not saying these totems are radioactive, but you'd have to be bongos-level bonkers not to consider it as a rational explanation. For the sake of everyone, please consider immediately transporting this archaeological cache to my laboratory upon excavation. Although careful precautions may slow down the pace of research, my team is one of only a few in the nation with the proper equipment to actually handle this matter safely."

4. Amid the din, museum curator @@RANDOM_NAME@@ squeezes into your office while clutching @@HIS@@ limited-edition copy of '[i]Ancient Civilisations for Dummies[/i]'. "I think we're all missing the point here! These are priceless artifacts, hearkening back to the days before @@NAME@@ was even around! If you don't have the maturity to leave them where they are, at the very least send them to my museum so other @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ can actually appreciate what came before them!"

[5]. A shallow bowl of apple purée smashes through the window, covering everyone in the room but you. Down on the street, a pious elderly individual paces furiously. "HERESY! WITCHCRAFT! @@LEADER@@, these totems are an affront to my faith! Why you haven't already destroyed them for the sake of @@NAME@@, I have no idea! [[color=blue]Must not be atheist[/color]]

[b][anchor=1258]#1258[/anchor]: Henceforward Shall Be Free [The Sakhalinsk Empire; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
As @@NAME@@ has finally liberated all its slaves, nobody really knows what to do with them.

The Debate
1. "They should be free to live without violence and to work faithfully for reasonable wages, and of course, be good citizens of our nation," says your top adviser, @@@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@@ Lyncoln, while stroking his beard. "We should grant them full citizenship and treat them like any other person; otherwise, they will still remain as slaves in their minds."

2. "These poor people were stolen from their homeland and taken to our land," states your Minister of the Interior, @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Monrow. "They don't belong in our society, and can only reintegrate successfully back among their own kind. We should be universally repatriating them back to the lands of their forefathers, where they can begin life anew."

3. "All right, we've liberated slaves, but that doesn't make them equal!" remarks @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Voster. "Let them be free all they want, but they'll need to know they're different from us. They'll have to use separate beaches, buses, toilets, everything. Just make sure that we get the good stuff."

[b][anchor=1259]#1259[/anchor]: Buy Low, Sell High [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Your teenage niece was visibly upset this morning when she couldn't get tickets to see her favorite boy band in concert. As usual, the tickets were sold out within seconds of being offered, with the vast majority going to scalpers intending to resell the tickets at a marked-up price.

The Debate
1. "Whether it's tickets for a pop concert or the ballet, these scalpers are a menace to anyone who wants some good entertainment," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, host of popular consumers rights podcast [i]Scumbag Sellers[/i]. "Scalping needs to be banned. Tickets must only be sold by government-approved retailers and websites that adhere to strict regulations."

2. "Scalpers are just people who are trying to make a living, but why not ban the more unethical practices?" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Ministry of Compromises. "You could simply ban the bots and software that these scalpers use to snatch up tickets? That way you're still allowing some resale, but genuine customers aren't screwed over in the process."

3. "Blockchain is the solution!" claims one of your older ministers, who you suspect is parroting an opinion offered to @@HIM@@ by someone more tech-literate. "Blocks of chains on the internet build trust without a middleman, with uh... queued 'R' codes or something. All we need to do is give a budget to some tech start-up companies, buy them some crypt coins or something, and they'll solve the problem for us!"

4. "The problem is that people fail to understand basic economics," points out economics professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is known for @@HIS@@ condescending online lectures. "Haven't you heard of supply and demand? Scalpers only exist because the original sellers are foolishly under-pricing their goods: the market will self-adjust eventually, and the middlemen will be squeezed out. What we need is compulsory economics classes so that people actually understand free market capitalism and how the economy works. Then maybe there won't be so many calls for clumsy top-down solutions imposed by government."
