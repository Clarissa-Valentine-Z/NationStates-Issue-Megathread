[b][anchor=1760]#1760[/anchor]: A Little Spanner in the Works [Fhaengshia; ed: Jiangbei][/b]

The Issue
A six-year-old was maimed in a horrific assembly line accident after being unable to reach the safety stop button on their workstation. In response, the Child Factory Workers Union has called for a nationwide strike against factory owners. After their last negotiations ended in a spirited food fight, your cabinet has arranged both parties in orderly lines on opposite sides of your office, asking you to arbitrate on the nation's labor laws.

The Debate
1. "I don't wanna work anymore! It's loud and scary!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the injured child, waving a bandaged stump and accompanied by @@HIS@@ 10-year-old nurse. "They lock us in the factory all day with no toys. Please make a rule that kids should never work. I wanna play with my friends outside and have fun and never go back." The nurse sighs and adds, "All of us children could do with some more learning. They hired me just because I dressed dolls really well. We should have school until we grow up, then we can do better work."

*2. "Production has ground to a halt!" exclaims factory owner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, scrubbing a red stain off @@HIS@@ glasses. "We're missing deadlines and that's going to have knock-on effects on our downstream supply chains. We need emergency subsidies to fix our backlog ASAP. And remind these brats that strikes are treason and break them up with whatever means you can!" [[color=blue]Must have Private Industry[/color]]

*3. "Production has ground to a halt!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the persnickety Secretary of the Central Commission for Domestic Production. "We need our little comrades working, or else our adult manufacturing specialists down the line will miss their quotas. Get us some child-safe machinery so the little proletarians can get back on shift. And send some marshals to remind these striking youngsters that the revolution has no room for loafers!" [[color=red]Must not have Private Industry[/color]]

4. "Why have we let those out-of-touch old-timers manage today's workplaces?" blasts teenage factory floor manager @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is picking at @@HIS@@ acne. "This would never have happened if we were running the factory in the first place! I do a better job than those ignorant boomers, but the plexiglass ceiling stops people my age from entering senior management. If you hand over the reins to me, I'll have the factory productive again in no time!"

The Issue
While sipping on a hot cocoa during a lull in a economic summit in the mountain town of Snowy Bluffs, you're suddenly pulled into an altercation over locals being priced out of their homes due to the world-famous ski resorts hosted in the town.

The Debate
1. "Please, @@LEADER@@, warm your icy heart, we don't want to lose our homes!" pleads a large, muscular native of Snowy Bluffs covered in shaggy white hair. "These resorts offered us jobs and an economic boost, and we fell for those sirens. At first they brought short-term income, but now we've been frozen out of our life because they refuse to hire us! They ought to save us with a year-round, well-paid job and unlimited use of resort amenities. Ski resorts would get guaranteed labor and us Bluffians get to keep our homes; what's not to like?"

2. "Last time I checked, we were a capitalist country, no?" says resort executive and wealthy host of the summit, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, piling bushy economics textbooks onto the coffee table before you. "The natives signed off on our use of the land as long as they made those sweet, sweet, dollars. We offered them good jobs, but they thought they were too good to wait tables or pick up trash. Well, guess what: we found cheaper employees, and now they come back crawling. Too bad! You'd be better off investing in our resorts, and hire around the clock security to keep the riff raff out, if you want to keep having your fancy how-to-dos here!"

3. The chair of the Beachside Estate Subgroup, and owner of @@NAME@@'s largest coastal resort, turns around as they overhear the conversation. "Say, @@LEADER@@, I couldn't help but overhear, but I think I've got a solution: since this is a problem created by these skiing skinflints, all you've got to do is kick them out! Let's ban these overcrowded tourist ski resorts and turn these beautiful mountains all into pristine national parks. They can go to my beaches instead! And property values here will plumme — er, become more affordable for the current residents!"

4. You hear a deafening bang as mining industry magnate @@RANDOM_NAME@@ caterwauls in. "You know, most of these towns used to be mining settlements..." says the dynamite-wielding powderman. "There oughta be a veritable treasure trove of untapped resources hidden in these here mountains! If the natives need well-paying jobs, then come on down to the mines! Everybody gets a stable income! There's no need to slave away in a ski resort when you can live in the lap of luxury at your local mineshaft! Sure, the skiing companies may throw a fit, but I'm sure if you buy 'em off they'll shut their snow-laden mouths! Give us the go-ahead and we'll blow 'em up before you can say 'labor rights'!"

The Issue
Generous reforestation subsidies have been eagerly seized by land developers, but critics are complaining that a large proportion of these new forests lack necessary biodiversity.

The Debate
1a. "Too many of these newly-planted forests are commercial orchards, monoculture logging woodlands, or just fast-growing pinewoods, which frankly aren't much better for ecological prosperity than barren deserts or frozen tundras," complains ecologist Lita Kynes, wearing an eclectic mix of fashion pieces. "Variety is the spice of life! You must withhold these subsidies unless they are used for robust and biodiverse forests that actually heal the planet." [[color=red]Must not have Nudity[/color]]

"Variety is the spice of life! You must withhold these subsidies unless they are used for robust and biodiverse forests that actually heal the planet." [[color=blue]Must have Nudity[/color]]

2. "You have to be able to see the wood from the trees," counters industry fatcat Vladimir Barren-Harkonion, digging greasy fingers into an enormous bag of chips he is working his way through. "To be frank, monocultural forests are far more commercially viable, and we need those margins to encourage private sector participation. These money-hating tree huggers would rather us create no new forests than see philanthropists like me do some good! Do you want your money to go into tiny copses, or vast tracts of canopied green land? If you'll boost up those subsidies and allow us to plant more tracts of forest, we'll experience the best of both worlds!"

3a. "This just shows that even well-intentioned government subsidies are an inefficient use of taxpayer @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@," explains free market economist Edric Navigator, puffing on an inhalator producing a weirdly orange vapour. "If you stop handing out these subsidies, I foresee the undistorted market being ultimately smarter than the grubby little hands of the government, and more likely to produce the best outcomes.

The Issue
Mega-conglomerate Jimson & Jimson, maker of everything from dish rags to snack foods, has been criticized for making their employees work in soul-crushing conditions. An anonymous whistleblower has reported that these practices were intentionally designed to exacerbate depressive symptoms, so that the company could increase sales of their notoriously addictive line of antidepressants.

The Debate
1. A former factory worker sways dejectedly before your desk with a thousand-yard stare. "Oh, @@LEADER@@, it was horrible! Every day I clocked into work at the break of dawn or dark of night, with extra-long shifts on birthdays and holidays! The warehouse was monochrome grey, and I packed boxes over and over again. No matter the quota, the manager always wanted more. When the 'Worker's Health' officer noticed I was sad, she offered me a bottle of the company's pills, free of charge. Months after quitting, I still need them to feel normal. Force Jimson & Jimson to reform their workplaces, provide free mental health services, pay for recovery for those who got addicted — and most of all, get those hellish pills off the market!"

2. "Oh, what scurrilous nonsense!" shouts Thaddeus Nathanael Elbridge Jimson III, CEO of Jimson & Jimson, using his diamond-tipped cane to scare his former employee away. "Our factories are designed simply to be the most profitable. Our employees perform their contracted tasks, no different than any other workplace! The difference between us is that we have the resources to help out! If we see someone struggling, we help with best pharmaceuticals in @@NAME@@! Never mind the fact that most of them are relieved of their duties after they become... let's say, overly reliant on them. The government ought to subsidize our program so that we can continue to support our employees! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a hostile takeover scheduled in 10 minutes."

3. "Some great innovation from the private sector, but how can we perfect it?" ponders your brother, the senior vice president at an investment firm. "Obviously these products have cross-demographic appeal and high customer retention, and with the government's wide reach, we can create a solid customer base by the next quarter. If we invest money into developing newer and more effective products, we can easily become the unquestioned supplier of these medicines to @@NAME@@I and turn our whole population into customers. Then, we can raise prices to improve our bottom line, and even save on labor costs by offering employees a choice between money and pills. Now that's a project I'd invest in!"

[b][anchor=1764]#1764[/anchor]: Many Are Called [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Haymarket Riot][/b]

The Issue
Yesterday, the judiciary released a study showing that nearly half of all people called for jury service are excused, with most citing childcare or medical issues as the reason. You've walked down the street from your office to @@CAPITAL@@ courthouse to investigate more yourself.

The Debate
1. "This is a problem for justice, as it means our juries are not truly representative of our whole population," complains Justice Law, who isn't a judge or a legal professional, but rather just has an awesomely apposite name and a penchant for watching court dramas. "We need to tighten up the exemption criteria considerably, and up the fines incurred for failure to attend this vital civic duty. When justice isn't put first, everybody loses. At least, that's what I always say at the lunchtime canteen queue."

2. "Look, why do you want to have resentful jurors who don't want to be there?" asks Thicc Tony, a defendant. "Jury service should be opt-in, with civic-minded citizens stepping forward to offer their services, free of charge. I think you'll find there'll be a surprising number of volunteers—I can name a dozen totally impartial dockyard workers who'd be more than happy to take time off to serve on my trial, and who will swear an oath that they do not know me or my family, on pain of death. Everybody wins!"

3. "The reason why people don't want to go to jury service is because time is literally money," observes an idiot who doesn't know what 'literally' means. "You should pay people for their jury time at an amount equal to earnings lost. For care commitments, pay for help. For medical problems, bring medical support into the courtroom. Any problem can be surmounted if you're willing to pay to solve it."

4. Judge @@RANDOM_NAME@@ sighs wistfully as @@HE@@ passes you and briefly comments, "The sad truth of the matter is, all three of these kind citizens are on the right track, but the imperfectness of their suggestions highlights that actually, the common rabble simply isn't smart enough to make good decisions on convictions." @@HE@@ stops, thinks for a moment, and continues as @@HE@@ fluffs out @@HIS@@ robes, "I'd hate to interfere too much with the executive, but it might be advised that you just eliminate the trouble of juries altogether. My colleagues and I are experts in the law who are perfectly able to rule by ourselves, and we're paid for it at no additional cost to you!"

Bed bugs have infested @@NAME@@'s headlines ever since the nation's preeminent travel critic spread bed bugs across @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@'s one-star hotels. These nocturnal parasites are detested for causing itchy welts, damage to furniture, and for their propensity to hitch rides in luggage.

The Debate
1. "These little vampires are sucking me dry!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hotelier of the famous Auspicious Auberge of @@CAPITAL@@'s historic district. "My family has owned this establishment for generations, now our legacy is forever tarnished by some hack reviewer. Let me collect compensation from any patrons careless enough to lay those [i]beasts[/i] in my property!"

2. "You think I chose this?" retorts the pockmarked visage of the travel critic in question, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who in fact chose to sleep in the infamous, bug-infested "No-Tell Mo-Tel" last month before embarking on @@HIS@@ review tour. "I gave a nasty hovel my business and now my wallet is on the line? Hotels oughta be held responsible for harboring the infestation! Tell you what, you should force the penny-pinching padrones at the No-Tell Mo-Tel to pay for fumigating my pad." @@HE@@ takes a gander at your expensive divan. "Mind if I have a seat?"

3. "We're talking about bottom lines in the middle of an epidemic?" growls a basso voice from beneath the tinted visor of a hazmat suit. "The public is right to fear our only natural predators, but independent exterminators like myself are stretched too thin to take a bite out of the hordes. Partner with us to expand fumigation and heat treatments, and @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ may sleep soundly yet once we destroy all bedbugs in @@NAME@@. We'll need better equipment, more manpower, immunity from wrongful death charges, and the authority to seize bed frames, kitchen appliances, personal electronics, and anything else that could house a colony!"

1a. "The adults are not alright!" exclaims teenage ShortTok star and self-proclaimed representative of outraged young people @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@. "These blatantly biased votes are what happens when the current legislature consists almost entirely of geriatrics who require round-the-clock nurse aids and afternoon naps.

2. "This whippersnapper is asking for a smack across the mouth!" scoffs your groggy octogenarian Youth Minister @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@, nearly spitting out @@HIS_2@@ dentures in outrage. "I don't have the time to listen to @@HIM_1@@ whine. Age quotas won't get us anywhere except having more uneducated, inexperienced and 'woke' juveniles telling us all how to suck eggs or how tying an onion to your belt is 'cringe'. The older generation have a wealth more knowledge of our history, legislation, and political system. I say we bring in an age minimum for our political representatives to prevent these ignorant brats from ever calling the shots! Now where's my cheap oatmeal? I'm starved!"

[3]. "You're all missing the bigger picture," interjects young political activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who's too cool for school but not for a think tank internship. "You see, governments are much like milk — once they age they become sour and rotten. Similarly, our current leadership is perceived as corrosive and decayed because it's barely changed in decades. If you introduced term limits, we could prevent representatives from overstaying their welcome and neglecting youth issues while prioritizing their generation's self interests.

The Issue
A new study performed in East @@CAPITAL@@ High School showed a major increase in student engagement when video games were added to lessons. A gaggle of laptop-wielding citizens stand in your office, debating the role of video games in education.

The Debate
1. "Video games in schools have an unparalleled ability to create informed citizens! Educational titles like DEFCOM: Nobody Wins and Climate Change Simulator promote both responsibility and social consciousness." proclaims bleeding-heart politician @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@. "Studies by Skandilundian scientists have already shown that people who played these games are 200% more aware of impending doom. It's seriously impressive, there are kindergarteners expressing nihilism at an 8th grade level! Why should our children miss out on the fun?"

2. "This 'peace and love' garbage is the complete wrong way to use video games, they ought to instill good, @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ values!" declares war hero Kaji Calder, medals jingling. "Now most video games are mindless, brain-rotting slop, but games like Call of Honor have made my son a true patriot if I've ever seen one", he adds. "The quick motions needed to gun down hordes of enemy Bigtopians develop both reflexes and national pride! And don't even get me started on that glorious scene where you raise the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ flag over the Valkstag. Include military shooters in the national curriculum, and we'll have these kiddos saluting our flag as often as they breathe!"

3. "It's not nukes or foreign soldiers that are going to kill our kids," says your Minister of Health, injecting you with your annual flu shot. "It's germs! If video games are going to be played in schools, they should make our kids healthier. Pandemic Co. teaches students the importance of vaccinations, how diseases spread, antibiotic resistance, hypochondria, and many more useful concepts. It might actually convince some of those dirty little buggers to wash their hands! Of course, we'll need to ensure all keyboards are properly sanitized so we don't have any kids catching the Black Death."

4. The nephew you're babysitting looks up from his tablet and babbles, "Know what I think? We should be playing games we actually like in school. BloxCraft taught me how to build things and be creative, and Furlough taught me friendship and teamwork! Give us some class time where we can play whatever video games we want. The teacher can even play too! That way we learn stuff and have fun! Oh, and I promise I won't say naughty words when I die this time!"

5. "I send my kids to school for them to study in the real world. They're already on their damn games at home all day anyway!", interjects concerned parent @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@, confiscating @@HIS_2@@ son's Rintendo Swap and waving it in your face. "School is supposed to be a place for learning, not for sitting around doing nothing. Keep these electronic doodads far away from our youth!

The Debate
1. "I nearly died because of the selfishness of these people!" complains @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, the @@MAN_1@@ in question, playing with toy cars in a definitely not road-safe manner on your desk. "Well, maybe not these exact people, but you get the point! @@LEADER@@, you must make it so that emergency drivers are legally able to do whatever's necessary to reach people in emergencies!

"I would have been late for work if I'd waited all that time for the ambulance to pass, and now you want to give them permission to damage our cars?

An international court has ruled that the seizure and depopulation of the Maralids — a far-flung Albionian colonial possession turned naval base, known for its abundant fisheries — was illegal and must be returned to its original owner, the small island nation of Wuriteus. Hoping to unwind at a summit for world leaders, you walk straight into the flying spittle of the ambassadors of Wuriteus and Albionia.

The Debate
1. "The archipelago is our birthright," wails the scrawny Wuritean ambassador. "My grandfather lived in the Maralids! Or maybe he was my pen pal. It's fuzzy." Pocketing a canapé, he adds, "Albionia may have more money, a larger military, more resources, and well, you get the point, but you know what is right in your heart. Condemn Albionian colonialism and demand that we be returned our rightful lands. If they refuse, sanction them to hell and back! Please, do whatever it takes to make our country whole!"

2. "Nonsense," proclaims the heavy-set Albionian ambassador, shoving his Wuritean counterpart out of the way. "Why, we might as well give the land back to the Neanderthals then! The indigenous inhabitants were primitive, without so much as a single electric kettle in sight! And now that we've done all the work modernizing it, they want it back?

Still, we can't afford to damage our relationship with the Albionians. I've got a draft statement prepared, inoffensive and neutral."

1.

I never wanted to resort to senseless violence but I had no choice! I beg you for mercy, @@LEADER@@—require split signing for all separated Violet couples!"

2. "You're can't force me to sign anything," sneers the offending ex in question while nursing their violet bruises with an ice pack. "The holy [i]Mauve Marriage Memorandum[/i] is clear; @@RANDOM__FIRST_NAME_1@@ has given me no good cause to separate, so I have no reason to give consent for a split. Instead, your government should focus on arresting those heathen thugs who laid their hands on me. And lock away @@RANDOM__FIRST_NAME_1@@ while you're at it—a little hard time and @@HE_1@@ will be crawling back as my grateful spouse, I'm sure."

3. "That does it!" righteously fumes your Minister of Religious Affairs. "I've got the Cult of Cyan demanding jaywalking rights on Tuesday if it rains, the Yellowists say they can't dance if they want to and it's your fault—for some reason—and now this? I've had it! Give my department the good word, @@LEADER@@, and we'll get to work doctoring these wackos' doctrine into a simple ruleset aligned with the law. The religious nutters can keep their silly little rituals, and we can stop flagellating ourselves over all their holy little details."

*4. "Naw—the real problem here is a lack of spice," interjects your giddy nephew, fresh off his sixth wedding. "Variety! Having only one spouse gets so stale so fast. But it's no problemo for us multi-lovers. Got problems with one ol' partner? Just hang with your other mates for a while! Just like that—divorce averted! These stuck-up Violetists really have some learning to do. Say, you oughta dump some @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ into endorsing polygamy as the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ solution to a happy marriage!" [[color=red]Polygamy is not legal[/color]]

The Issue
Multibillionaire Scotia Mackenzie — famous for being a novelist and an activist, but most of all for divorcing an [i]extremely[/i] wealthy person — recently donated a gargantuan sum to various charities.

The Debate
1. "She's a true hero of our time! That money is going to make a lot of difference to a lot of young llamas," enthuses Wally, the cheerful president of the Oh! Llamas Foundation, a major beneficiary. "The common folk are lauding her, from award-winning journalists to her humble fellow billionaires. They've even added a new daily episode about her on that famous game, CountryProvinces. You should join in and announce that the government will match all charitable donations the people make."

2. "She gave away less than 1% of her total wealth, and we're supposed to applaud her?" asks Joe O'Dinnary, whose net donations last year consisted of an old button in the collection plate. "Her ex-husband is even richer, and [i]he[/i] donates almost nothing. Let's face it, these fat cats' philanthropy is nothing more than a performative façade to justify their obscene wealth; nobody should be that wealthy anyway. We need to shrink wealth gaps in society by seizing the assets of the avaricious and redistributing the proceeds to the poorest in society."

3a. "I think we can respect personal property while simultaneously creating a culture of philanthropic giving," suggests William Doors, the multibillionaire creator of the Windoors operating system. "I've personally pledged to give away almost my entire fortune and to scrape by on a mere billion or so. We should shame the super-rich who aren't as great as me. Put up unflattering portrait posters decrying them as selfish bozos! Encourage people to pelt them with rotten eggs and to break wind in their general direction. They'll soon change their ways!"

4. "Oh, there's a problem alright, and it's that we're perpetuating this disgusting handout culture in the first place," laments Olen Mursk, trying to see how many Wheelex watches he can fit on his arm. "You should shame Mackenzie for providing undue money to undeserving people and do your utmost to discourage philanthropy. If you didn't earn it, you don't get it."
