The Issue
Following a high-profile stadium tour by @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ nationalist metal band [i]Exterminate Bigtopia[/i], there has been a surge in the number of anti-Bigtopian hate crimes. Only yesterday, skinheads set fire to an effigy of a Bigtopian teacher in the playground of your nephew's school, and the PTA are pressing you to take action.

The Debate
1. "Look at what this awful racket has done to our children," sobs Efthamia Wickremesinghe, leader of [i]Bigtopian Mothers Against Malicious Anthems[/i], better known as [i]BigMAMA[/i]. "My family is made up of three generations of proud @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, at least two of which speak the language like natives! But now my little @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ is being exposed to hateful extremist music at all hours of the night! You must ban all music that is racist in content, or made by racists."

2. Your teenage niece, who is wearing a band T-shirt depicting a decapitated Bigtopian, elbows her way into your office to yell at you. "This is exactly why everyone's mad at you! Who cares if big-nosed Bigtopians are offended? Leave us metal fans alone and let us listen to whatever we want to."

3. The teenager's mother, from the rotten side of the family, totters over to offer you a pamphlet on 'Devil Immigrants'. "Now dearie, all that guitar noise is a little unpleasant, but you must admit that Bigtopians are criminals, and have taken quite a lot of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ jobs, and are genetically subhuman, of course. Maybe we shouldn't be letting those sort of people live with us."

The Issue
State-level agricultural organisation and socialist worker toil has paid off: @@NAME@@ is producing high-quality cuts of meat that are internationally recognised as being exceptionally delicious. So much so, that those foreign capitalists are sniffing around to see if they can have a cut of the action.

The Debate
1. "Thing is, 'comrade', what you've got here is a prime product which is in high demand across the world," schmoozes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of Cold Capitalist Logistics. "We're not asking you to abandon a governmental system that is clearly delivering great results; we're just hoping that y'all let us help share your product with the global market. The cash coming back to your state coffers will help fund your commie agenda. That's a good thing, right?"

2. "Wait, we do the work, and you pocket the profits?" asks local farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ somewhat incredulously, as @@HE@@ slides on an elbow-length rubber glove in a worryingly menacing fashion. "Way I see it, the people doing the work should be rewarded in proportion to the wealth they generate. Basically, let the proceeds of the sale filter back to a company of folk in charge of the operation, who can then use that money to employ some workers, and those workers can use their new personal wealth to buy and trade freely, while the various processes that are incorporated in production can compete against each other to provide the best-selling product for the lowest prices. I'm sure I've heard of a system like that before..."

3. "The purpose of state agriculture is not to feed capitalist nations!" yells horrified Marxist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, making a note to report the previous speaker to the National Loyalty Bureau. "The produce of @@NAME@@ should meet the needs of the proletariat. If we produce too much for @@NAME@@, then we should send it freely to other socialist countries to aid the global revolution! This is what communism is about: the pursuit of an efficient and fair society worldwide, not the generation of filthy lucre!"

4. "Actually, looking at the numbers, I'm wondering about our overall agricultural strategy," murmurs statistician and economic planner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, skinny fingers tapping at a calculator. "The ratio of land and labour use to calorie output is very poor for meats of all sorts, and we would be far better off with arable farming alone, and a meat-free national diet. Freeing up workers from food production would let us reassign them to other more modern industries, such as electronics and tech production. This is a chance to show the world the strength and efficiency of a properly run planned economy."

The Issue
Halfway across the world a small and not particularly important nation has gained internationally recognized independence. The problem? They have decided to call themselves @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "Tourists accidentally flying to the wrong part of the world, diplomatic communiques wired to the wrong ambassadors," moans your advisor, who confusingly shares your name. "There are millions of perfectly fine, unused names for nations; why'd they have to filch ours? Issue threats, impose sanctions, do whatever it takes to get our good name back."

2. On the phone is the improbably named @@LEADER@@ Jr., president of the other @@NAME@@. "@@NAME@@ is derived from anthropologists' translation of the oldest 'Linear V' tablet found in our nation. Or maybe they're just some meaningless scribbles; they aren't totally sure. The point is we have a legitimate claim to the name, and we're not changing it!"

3. "A small, newly independent, weak nation you say?" asks your Minister of War, Jacob John Schmidt Jingleheimer. "An easy way to reduce the ambiguity is to simply make them our territory. Besides, if @@NAME@@ invades @@NAME@@, wouldn't the international community just consider it a civil war?"

4. "Look, maybe there's a compromise we could make here," suggests a passer-by. "I hear that the World Census people have put in a mechanism for nations to change which letters are capitalized in nation names, so for example Brancaland could choose to rename itself bRanCaLand. Perhaps as a gesture of goodwill we could offer the other @@NAME@@ a sizeable foreign aid allocation, with the condition that they stick the capital letters in different places to make it clear they're not us. It'll work, I'm sure, or my name's not maX bARRy."

The Issue
The @@NAME@@ College Sports Association has a long-standing policy that collegiate athletes do not get paid. Several high-profile players have taken to camping out in the student loan office until their grievances are addressed.

The Debate
1. "Our team brings zillions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to campus," notes @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, a member of the University of @@NAME@@ @@ANIMAL@@ball team. "We put our blood, sweat, and tears into representing this school, and we don't even get compensation for our work!

2. "Kids these days," trails off @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an executive of the @@NAME_INITIALS@@CSA, struggling to remember @@HIS@@ talking point. "I mean to say, they're already being paid in scholarships! Elite athletes will have plenty of time to profit from their talents once their school days are over, so don't let scholarship recipients be distracted by monetization. They need to stay focused on earning their degrees."

3. "Not all sports are equally profitable," says snow volleyball player @@RANDOM_NAME@@, taking a break from practice. "Professionalizing collegiate athletes would let popular @@ANIMAL@@ball players like @@LASTNAME_1@@ make bank while programs like mine fall by the wayside. @@NAME@@ should enforce a code of amateurism in all its sports, on campus or off. It's the only way to be fair."

4. "Who let all these jocks on campus?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an honors student at the University of @@CAPITAL@@. "The point of higher education is to pursue knowledge and prepare for your career, not watching your sweaty classmates fight over their balls. Let's do away with college sports entirely and reaffirm our commitment to what university is really about: learning, research, and pursuing hot co-eds."

The Debate
1. "Young women these days are under such pressure," sighs casting agent @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "They'll do anything for the attention. Her reputation as a wholesome young @@DEMONYM@@ lies in tatters; I don't think we need to bring the weight of the law to bear.

[b][anchor=1305]#1305[/anchor]: The Woman From AUNT [Altmer Dominion; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
An intelligence team, the "Agents Undercover to Neutralize Troublemakers", has pinpointed the headquarters of notorious crime boss Sal Bone. Unfortunately, it is concealed within a local orphanage, of which Mr. Bone is a sponsor. Lacking only a smoking gun, AUNT has come to your office with a delicate request.

The Debate
1. "AUNT would like to launch a mole operation inside the orphanage," buzzes Special Agent Angela Haskell, radioing in from an undisclosed location. "One problem: none of the team is young enough to pull off an effective inside job. We've been kicking around the idea of recruiting and training a few kids — maybe orphans themselves — to act as our eyes and ears. Already got a circus kid named Grayson as a potential candidate. There's a lot of covert situations where juvenile agents could be useful. If this mission goes well, we could even expand their role into a full-time intelligence division."

2. "The team opinion ain't unanimous!" yells Special Agent Miley Orbison, her voice crackling through the receiver. "We don't need to endanger defenseless children! We just need to teach smaller-sized adult women how to act like kids. With a convincing enough performance, I'm sure they'll pass as kids in no time!"

3. "What are these fools waiting for?" bellows Colonel @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, furiously switching off the communication channel. "A 90% certainty is good enough for me. The best thing to do is to stop messing about, and authorize SWAT teams to kick down doors, blast holes in walls, and raid the orphanage, ASAP. Perhaps if we had a little more efficiency, we could cut AUNT's departmental budget, and channel it into funding actual combat-ready military counter-terrorism units."

4. "I represent a group which is... strongly concerned... with the ever-increasing surveillance state within this great nation," murmurs a @@DEMONYM@@ in a dapper black suit, sidling into the room to hand you a freshly-printed business card. "Spying on a private citizen, a benefactor of an orphanage no less, is nothing less than harassment." @@HE@@ gestures tenderly to a large briefcase sitting next to @@HIM@@. "I'm sure a... satisfactory arrangement can be reached here. You wouldn't want to frighten some perfectly innocent children, now would you?"

The Issue
A report released by the Mathematical Sciences Institute has revealed that only one in four @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ schoolchildren is taught by a qualified math teacher. Your advisers speculate that the populace may eventually be rendered too ignorant to pay their taxes, and so urge immediate action.

The Debate
1. "We have plenty of teachers; they just don't teach math... yet," remarks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a high-level education official. "So just retrain a bunch of 'em. Mandatory retraining sessions can be held whenever student demand is light, like evenings, weekends, lunch breaks, and national holidays. But sooner or later, boom, you've got qualified math teachers. Didn't even need a calculator."

2. "If a school has four math classes, but only one math teacher, what should you do?" asks @@CAPITAL@@-area algebra teacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has been grading multiple choice questions for too long. "Should you, A, cry tears of despair over the impending mathocalypse? B, beat the living snot out of any useless, uninformed bureaucrats who advocate for what is, essentially, educator abuse? Or C, invest more @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ into math departments across @@NAME@@ in order to make teaching more appealing to graduates with math-related degrees? The answer here is clear."

3. "The school system is puttin' too much pressure on our kids," rambles rural bureaucrat @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Where I'm from, the only knowledge y'need is how to live off the land, and how to respect folks. So let's take math out of the curriculum, and stress more practical knowledge, like farming or resource conservation! Might sound stupid, but I never learnt math, and I'm just fine! I've been the mayor of my town for twelve years!" @@HE/SHE@@ says, before checking on @@HIS/HER@@ fingers.

*4. "We've got a brainpower outage, it seems," states Deputy Minister of Immigration @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Perhaps the addition of skilled, foreign labor is just what we need. We should maximize our appeal from an immigration standpoint. Let's offer prospective math teachers lenient visa requirements, generous living accommodations, access to government transportation, and extensive financial benefits nobody could refuse. It'd obviously get pricey, but we're doing it for our kids, right?" [[color=Blue]Immigration is legal[/color]]

I think it would be good for him to get out and help the community," says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, bustling into your office while the teenage boy trudging behind him rolls his eyes. "Not only will it help people in need, it will also give the students a chance to be a part of their community and a proud citizen of @@NATION@@."

2. "Hey, man, we don't have time to do community service when we spend the whole day on schoolwork and studying," @@HIS@@ @@BOY@@ tells you. "Chill out with the long school days and maybe we'll have more time to contribute to the community on our own."

3. Your cousin, who just stopped by to bring you cookies, pipes in. "I think community service programs are a great idea. Ten hours a year isn't that much time, but it can change a lot if enough people are doing it. There's no reason to limit it to students — just think of what we could do for the country if every able-bodied adult had to pitch in too!"

4. "Are you kidding me!" @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of NAT-U-RAL Co., shouts from the window of @@HIS@@ limousine. "I don't have time to go out and pick up trash. I'm doing the world a service by supplying the world with abundant amounts of natural gas! Surely that counts as community service. In fact, these kids could 'volunteer' at my plant — if you don't mind, of course." She slowly rolls her window up before driving off.

The death of three young children, who succumbed to sun stroke after being forgotten in the back seats of a poorly-ventilated vehicle, has sparked heated debate.

The Debate
1. "These parents deserve the death penalty for their negligence," spits Charlotte Sestero, childless author of the book [i]Perfect Parenting[/i]. "Three children died, and someone has to pay! What's more, there should be a licence examination that people take before they're allowed to have kids. Some people are too ignorant to be allowed to breed!"

2. "There should be consequences, but also support," wheezes Han Barrow, Minister of State Nannying, looking close to having a heat stroke @@HIM@@self, as @@HIS@@ prodigious bulk sweats in the heat. "I suggest community service, plus bereavement counseling, and a nationwide program of heat safety promotion."

"Why, Lassie here took out six insurgents by herself, disarmed a nuclear device, and entertained the troops with cartwheels and backflips.

"If one @@ANIMAL@@ can do all that, imagine what an army full of them could achieve?

Public health officials across @@NAME@@ are demanding a restriction on bushmeat consumption, asserting that handling and eating bushmeat can transfer new and deadly diseases from animals to humans. These officials cite VODAIS, ebola and coronavirus as examples of diseases that were originally contracted by humans after eating bushmeat. You have arrived in the jungles of southern @@NAME@@ to assess the nation's bushmeat market.

The Debate
1. "This is how a pandemic starts," declares Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@HIS@@ arm extended at the scene before you. "You see here stalls selling bushmeat from the jungle, some scavenged from already-dead carcasses. Wild animals are pathogen factories; we shouldn't be ingesting their flesh. Look at that butcher's floor, covered in monkey blood! VODAIS started with cross-species viral transmission, and this is how the next killer will start too. Good public health practice demands that you should restrict the sale and consumption of meat from non-farmed animals." 

2. "Stop stirring the pot," jeers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a bushmeat vendor, chewing on a grilled bat wing. "This fearmongering kills business and keeps us poor and starving. You scientists have heads full of ideas, but we need full bellies! We cannot survive without bushmeat, and it is part of our culture!

Joan Cranmer — a mother who walked out on her partner and son two years ago, voluntarily cutting off all contact until she recently petitioned for custody — has just been awarded full custody of her son by the courts, with the judge stating "children are simply better off with their mother." This controversial ruling has led to calls for you to intervene.

The Debate
1. "She abandoned @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@, and now she wants to play mummy?" snaps Ed, Joan's ex-partner. "She doesn't even know him; I do. His favourite show is [i]Adolescent Zombie Ninja @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@[/i]. When he's sick, he likes boysenberry juice, through a curly straw. Mothers should know these things, but she went off to 'find herself'. I've done an amazing job with my son, and thanks to my help, he gets excellent grades in school now. Child custody should go to the most suitable parent, not just the one with the uterus. Fit parents don't dump their kid when they get bored."

2. "I was bored with Ed, not my son," insists Joan. "Ed is a very narcissistic man; he was stifling my soul. I couldn't even have friends. Now, I'm much better; I have my own career, and a lovely flat near one of the top schools in the country. I can provide for my son materially and I can be there emotionally. All children need their mother, no matter what. I am grateful that Ed stepped into the breach in my absence, but nothing can make up for a mother's love."

3. "A mother merely does what any common cat does," remarks proudly misogynist author of the mothering guide [i]Stop Whining and Push[/i]. "Why does simple childbirth give women special custody rights? Mothers may feel attachment, but fathers provide moral and mental instruction. See how the boy's grades improved with his father's influence." He holds up a book report with 'Did your father write this?' at the bottom.

"Look, clearly you guys are outclassed by us. How about you get your peacekeepers to 'peace off' home, and we'll call it a stalemate?"

[b][anchor=1315]#1315[/anchor]: No Boycott After All; Parliament Just Got Lost [AnPrim Island; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
The meeting of the newest randomly-selected Parliament was mysteriously delayed by nearly a week. As Member of Parliament Evan @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ finally revealed in a talk show appearance last night, the reason for this delay was that most new members had no idea where @@CAPITAL@@ was.

The Debate
1. "This just proves what I've been saying for ages: it's time for democracy in @@NAME@@!" shouts activist Ksenya @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ through a particularly loud bullhorn. "Surely the people can elect more knowledgeable leadership than these ignorant clowns! Just start holding regular elections and we'll have the government cleaned up in no time!" 

2. "Now, let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater," intones political scientist Richard @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_2@@. "We may have gotten a bad batch this time, but sortition has a lot of great benefits! Instead of burdening the people of @@NAME@@ with the illusion of choice, why not just limit the pool of potential members of Parliament to the adequately educated? College graduates should be able to bring leadership to @@CAPITAL@@, or at the very least, find it on a map." 

3. "@@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_2@@ has the right idea, but @@HE@@ doesn't go far enough," chimes in self-professed polymath Yolanda @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "Instead of limiting the pool of potential MPs, why not just make college education compulsory for all adults? Not only will the government be more informed, but the entire nation will be more informed, too! I'm sure there'll be enough dorms to house all those returning students..."

[b][anchor=1316]#1316[/anchor]: Gonna Take My Hearse to the Old Town Road [Pangurstan; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A hundred-car funeral procession happened to be passing by the @@CAPITAL@@ stadium just after the final game of the national @@ANIMAL@@ball Cup. The resulting massive traffic jam lasted for the rest of the day and blocked roads in most of downtown @@CAPITAL@@.

The Debate
1. "The funeral procession only blocked traffic because rude sports fans weren't giving them right of way," complains undertaker 'Hit-and-Run' Han. "If funeral processions were given absolute traffic priority, then the problem would be solved."

2. "The funeral was responsible for the traffic!" shouts angry sports fan Marleen Torres while making threatening gestures with an @@ANIMAL@@ball bat. "If they hadn't been moving at walking pace, there would have been no congestion. They should be expected to drive at the same speed as normal traffic, and there ought to be a maximum of five vehicles in a procession. In fact, if the dead were moved in vans instead of hearses, then nobody would feel the need to treat them differently on the road."

3. "It seems to me that the problem is traffic in general," states your transportation minister while doodling a skull and crossbones on a subway map. "Why don't you just build public transit systems from the funeral homes to graveyards? Or you could replace the bike holders on buses with coffin holders. Oh, and more buses and trains for living people too, that's probably a good idea."

[b][anchor=1317]#1317[/anchor]: Nanny State [Nuremgard; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
After the recent birth of the first child of Princess @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ of @@NAME@@, newspaper pundits have begun to question how Her Royal Highness will juggle the responsibilities of parenthood with her royal duties.

The Debate
1. "Look no further than I, your super-duper firm-but-fair classy granny's nanny," announces Kerri Cracking, sweeping through the door with a stylish bag made entirely out of mohair carpet. "Close your mouths, please, Ministers — we are not a codfish. As you see, I have worked only with the right sorts of family. I am stern, but kind; I don't put up with any nonsense, but have a somewhat magical effect on the youngsters. With me, the newborn royal will learn good manners, graceful refinement and be prepared to take their proper place in the world. Tell the applicants waiting outside to go fly a kite so I can get on. Spit spot."

2. "What century are you living in?" retorts your brand new Minister for Women's Equality @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, while scanning some application forms rather closely. "The royal nanny should be qualified in the latest childcare techniques, child development and first aid, and should be female. This will show the women of the nation your commitment to female employment. And she should be pretty. That way, a Rainbow Pony girls will know that being pretty doesn't mean a girl can't have talents; it'll bust stereotypes. And as the Princess is all pudgy and wan after the birth, it wouldn't hurt to have her trailed by someone more photogenic... Okay, who said that I won't last a week at the Ministry?"

[3]. "What century are we living in indeed?" asks your Minister for Transport, while adjusting the rainbow pin on his suit. "Why don't you hire a manny? A professional manny will be just as well-trained in childcare as any female nanny, and can be glamorous, ensuring the royal children are dressed in the latest and best styles. Not only that, it will show how progressive the royal family are, and how the entire community and their potential contribution to childrearing — regardless of their gender or sexual orientation — is valued. That's sure to win support for the royal family. How about it?"
[[color=blue]Legalized Same-sex marriage[/color]]

4. "Why embrace this century when you can embrace the future?" chimes your slightly singed Junior Science Adviser, lugging in his latest robotic prototype. "Meet LUL-2000, an AI nanny. Now, I know the blinking red eye looks a little strange and the hands are still a bit claw-like; the next one will have a skin on it, I swear. But think of this: it'll show your commitment to technology and science, and it'll give me a chance to show off the capabilities of my prototype. It feeds babies, burps them, changes them and puts them to bed content and safe 96.7% of the time. And the percentage [i]is[/i] rising. I mean, the kids might be scared to begin with but they'll adapt, right?"

5. "Or, here's a revolutionary idea," storms an exhausted woman as she bursts through the door, shaking off a toddler clinging to her leg and bouncing a crying newborn. "How about all the toffs look after their right royal brats their right royal selves? Crazy idea, I know. Royals are all busy dubbing ships [i]@@NAME_INITIALS@@S Snooty-Arse[/i] and whatever royals do. Well, I'm sorry, but other working mothers have to manage: up before dawn to do housework, spend half an hour with the kids, feed them, then out to work. Princess Whatshername can manage without help, too." Shoving her crying baby at you, she waltzes out of the meeting room, returning sheepishly moments later to collect him.

[b][anchor=1318]#1318[/anchor]: Blitzed [Baggieland; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
Recent historical research has revealed that the Smalltopian army's 'Lightning War' was ultimately successful because their troops had been given large doses of methamphetamine. Your top generals have encircled you in your office and this conversation isn't going to be an easy trip.

The Debate
1. "The Smalltopians crushed their enemies with their Lightning War," states Lieutenant General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, well known for @@HIS@@ singular battlefield tactic of 'more cannon fodder'. "They marched non-stop for four days and nights through thick forest, while carrying full packs, then fought and easily defeated their foes at the end. If @@NAME@@ wants to win any future wars quickly and efficiently, we need to start issuing our troops with methamphetamines."

2. "Methamphetamine does seem to be a useful addition to a war effort," ponders Major General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who prefers to lead by example. "However, there are health issues to consider. Methamphetamine should only be given to elite troops on dangerous missions. When those missions are over, there needs to be a comprehensive rehabilitation period to make sure no one is addicted or suffering from any side effects."

3. "Methamphetamine is a lethal drug!" declares General @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Army Medical Corps, as @@HIS@@ hands out pamphlets on the dangers of narcotics. "If we want our troops to win battles, then they must be fully coherent and at the peak of their physical fitness — not pumped full of drugs! In fact, all forms of substance abuse must be banned in the military: narcotics, alcohol and even caffeine."

4. ???

5. ???

6. ???

7. "Why only soldiers?" questions your secretary, as @@HE@@ grinds @@HIS@@ teeth incessantly, makes you a drink with one hand and takes meeting minutes with the other. "Look at all this work I have piled up on my desk, not to mention all the other tasks I'm expected to carry out. There's never enough time in the day! Dose every worker in @@NAME@@ with methamphetamines and see how efficient they become!"

[b][anchor=1319]#1319[/anchor]: Dying for Two [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A woman in southern @@NAME@@ has written a letter directly to you after being denied an abortion by her doctor, who feared contravening the laws that declare terminating pregnancies to be illegal. She is sixteen weeks pregnant with an anencephalic foetus — missing part of the skull and brain — who will live for a short time, and is herself rapidly sickening with complications related to lupus. Doctors have told her therapeutic abortion is her best chance for life, and would be offered in many countries, but not in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "Doctors often fear prescribing some treatments deemed most effective by global health organisations, in case it harms the foetus," argues Dr. Doris @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, not looking up as she works her way through a stack of paperwork. "If a woman is dying from a septic miscarriage, we fear intervening in case the foetus might still be alive, and are blocked from carrying out abortions even when it would save the mother's life. Women's health should not be second-class. Medical professionals should be exempt from sanction if foetal loss occurs as a result of our care, and should be allowed to carry out abortions where medically necessary. I'm not saying we should be proud of offering abortions, but we quietly and discretely do so when the need arises." 

2. "And what about the senseless slaughter of innocent babies?" sniffs Dr. Peter @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, who has eight children that he rarely sees. "There is no moral justification possible for the murder of a child. None, ever. Besides, pregnancy — even with lupus — is safer than it has ever been. It is possible that both [i]may[/i] live. Train doctors to treat women conservatively, preventing any avoidable harm to their pre-born children. Remember that there's two people here, and both deserve a chance to live."

3. "Some mothers are but phoenices," muses Ms. Lotta Childe, the childless partner of the founder of moralist group [i]As I Say[/i]. "Born to die, so that a new generation might arise from the ashes of their deaths. All birth is good, for life equals potential — ergo goodness. Rather than this ten-a-penny carrier's bugaboo, consider her tragic infant. We squander so much money on medicalising a normal, simple process. Let us return to wholly natural gestation and birth; prenatal scans and checks only worry the breeding stock unnecessarily. [i]If[/i] there are mishaps, remind mothers that only through sacrifice does our worthless existence mean something."

4. "The presence of pro-life legislation is critical to the moral health of this nation, but we cannot be entirely inflexible," offers Naomi @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, your Minister of Problematic Trolleys. "We should maintain our moral and legal stance in @@NAME@@, but allow for one-off exceptions to be made to allow specific patients to travel overseas for an abortion. Due consideration should involve a panel of experts and ethicists, as this is not a decision to be undertaken lightly."
