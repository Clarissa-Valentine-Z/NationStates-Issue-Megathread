[b][anchor=1020]#1020[/anchor]: Bi-NO-Metric? [Arthropol; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
After a record number of @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ passport thefts over the past year, there have been proposals to include biometric data on passports. 

The Debate
1. "Biometric passports are a great idea," says technological advocate @@RANDOMNAME@@, forcing a DNA-test swab into your mouth. "They could contain iris recognition, body maps and other data, rendering stolen passports useless. Plus, the data could be useful for other purposes, like solving crimes or census work. Passports would need to be renewed more frequently to keep them up to date, but you could charge at a small profit, and actually [i]make[/i] money from this."

2. "Before blissfully and benignly blundering into breaches bypassing basic rights, beware!" cries masked libertarian-anarchist 'B'. "Begone to this balderdash! Ban biometric background bata! Uh... I mean data."

[3]. "Why don't we just use citizens' implanted ID chips as passports?" queries Minister of Surveillance @@RANDOMNAME@@. "We could embed biometric data, but also track the exact movement of every @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ whether they are at home or abroad. Even if they solemnly swear that they are up to no mischief, we can never be sure unless we map their marauding meanderings." [[color=red]Must have ID Chips[/color]]

4. "Typical big government, attacking the free market economy," interjects novelty straw man factory manager @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Isn't it time you put @@NAME@@ first, instead of allowing the continuing brain drain of skilled workers from our nation? Void the whole passport and travel system, keeping foreigners out and @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ in, and we'll all surely prosper!"

The Issue
One night, while playing an extremely lengthy board game at your home in @@CAPITAL@@, you are interrupted by your worried-looking advisors. A recent exposé has revealed that Brancalandian corporations are buying up precious real estate in @@CAPITAL@@, often leaving it to sit vacant indefinitely.

The Debate
1. Your nephew's friend, housing activist @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ Chance, rolls the dice. "I have to share my apartment with three other people! With rent so high, we're forced to bunk together in spaces the size of a thimble! My utility closet alone contains a triple bunk bed! We @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ could afford some decent housing if foreign investors weren't driving up costs. You must forbid foreigners from owning real estate!"

2. "Housing prices aren't the real problem. National security is at risk here!" warns a stern-looking figure while using a clothes iron. "Brancalandians are buying up all this land because they want to establish a base of operations right in the heart of @@NAME@@. After we confiscate their property, we should beef up the military... just in case. Maybe build a few more battleships. Oh, and we could always aggressively buy some property in Brancaland and see how they like it!"

3. "Now, now," hushes banker @@RANDOMFIRSTNAM@@ Nickelbags, adjusting @@HIS@@ monocle. "The Brancalandians are just trying to establish strong economic ties with us. If we iron out the wrinkles, this could be lucrative for everyone. Let foreigners own land here, but charge them mega-dollars for the privilege. No free parking!"

4. "Foreign investors create demand for luxury housing," insists wealthy real estate developer Communa T. Chest, who took a ride on the railroad to @@CAPITAL@@. "If you push them out of the market, new housing development will grind to a halt! Now, if you want people to be able to afford their rent, maybe you should consider lowering some taxes instead. Luxury tax, maybe. No, how about income tax?"

5. "Whoa, whoa, ha ha ha..." interjects your Housing Minister, melodramatically sweeping your unfinished board game off the table. "We still allow private land ownership? Who let THAT little oversight slip through? Now, look. Where is our land located? @@NAME@@! And who runs @@NAME@@? The government! So who rightfully owns all that land? The government! Actually, maybe it's time we abandoned capitalism and had the government control everything."

[b][anchor=1022]#1022[/anchor]: Failure to Respond [Australian rePublic; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Recently, you found yourself trapped in a broken-down elevator, waiting nearly five hours for emergency services to turn up. You were told this was because their resources were tied up dealing with (among other things) a fake bomb scare, a patient taken to hospital with a runny nose, a man with his beard trapped in a deckchair, a mum having trouble getting groceries home from the store, and a broken DVD player in need of "emergency" repairs.

The Debate
1. "I can't believe we were trapped all that time because some idiots don't know the difference between an emergency vehicle and a taxi," complains @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@, your aide. "And that poor lady we were stuck with, and her overflowing catheter bag! That didn't end well for any of us... You should allow emergency services to ignore the calls of those who misuse the services!"

[2]. "Agreed, and we should also punish misuse of emergency services," suggests @@RANDOMNAME@@, a police officer who has recently returned from being called out to scare a toddler into eating his greens. "Anyone who wastes our time should do time in prison! Lock them up!" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

3. "You can't discourage people from using services when they might really need them," asserts fire fighter @@RANDOMNAME@@, striking a heroic magazine-cover pose. "I know that there are some who misuse the system, but overall, they need to know that we'll be there for them in times of crisis. In fact, you should boost the budgets of emergency services, and give us workers a pay bonus for each call we respond to. It's the only way to keep our nation safe!"

4. "Look, there's a reasonable middle ground here," offers former model and coastguard officer @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Just run an advertising campaign discouraging unnecessary emergency calls, and warn that you'll fine callers who waste resources. Like, maybe a poster of some barbed wire with the slogan ‘Don't call me, babe.' We'll cut down on time-wasting and also raise funds that you can use to cut down income tax."

[5]. "BROOOM BROOOM," says five-year old @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@, who has cheered up considerably since escaping the lift. "You're a dummy, you dummy. It's because you got rid of proper police cars and ambulances. That's why they are all so slow, you dummy. You should let everyone have cars again, dummy. NEEE NAW NEEEE NAAAAAW."

[b][anchor=1023]#1023[/anchor]: Pure Madness [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Purity balls have become the latest craze among some social conservatives in @@NAME@@, with many sexual abstinence groups endorsing a ceremony where teenage girls promise to remain chaste until they get married, wearing a ring as a token of that promise. Feminist groups, however, have denounced this practice.

The Debate
1. "This is patriarchy at its worst!" yells women's rights advocate @@RANDOMNAME@@, author of critical thesis [i]Purity: A History of Ball-Holding in @@NAME@@[/i]. "I can't bear to see any more photos of adolescent girls wearing wedding gowns, pledging their chastity to fathers dressed as bridegrooms. These men seem to think they own their daughters' bodies, to be transferred to their sons-in-law! Look, @@LEADER@@, I don't care if a woman wants to remain a virgin until she gets married, but these purity balls objectify women and should be banned."

2. "Whoa, so are you saying my daughter should stroll around the town with no ring on her finger, spreading the message that she is ‘fair game' to all the lusty bachelors who are eager to deflower her? What am I, a pimp?" rants @@RANDOMMALENAME_1@@, an enraged father, brandishing a pitchfork at you. "Teenage licentiousness is out of control in this country. If anything, we should ban premarital sex altogether, and if two unwed individuals are caught fornicating, they should be married to be cleansed of their sin!"

*3. "Not having sex before marriage is a bad idea," chimes in marriage counsellor @@RANDOMNAME@@, carefully positioning @@HIM@@self out of the potential trajectory of the pitchfork. "My conservative clients rushed into marriage without getting to know their prospective spouse well, because it was their only chance to have sex without social backlash; now they all experience marital problems. We should encourage young people to have premarital sex with their partners, to take time to see if they will be compatible, and also inform them about the contraceptive methods available."

5. "Preposterous!" exclaims @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAMENAME@@ @@RANDOMLASTNAME_1@@, a conservative but avowedly egalitarian mother, swiftly taking the pitchfork from her husband's hand and putting it away.

The Issue
@@RANDOMFIRSTNAME_1@@ Caesar, the current mayor of @@CAPITAL@@, is a prominent and popular member of your party who is wildly adored by @@DEMONYMNOUNPLURAL@@. However, @@HIS@@ time in office will soon end, due to the national laws on term limits.

The Debate
1. "We love our mayor!" squeals @@RANDOMNAME@@, an avid fan, eagerly showing off @@HIS@@ collection of Caesar-related memorabilia. "I hate to break it to you, but we simply don't like any of your party's other candidates. The opposition has fielded much better entrants this time round, and unless you remove term limits entirely, we may have no choice but to pick one of them! Trust us, if we had a choice, we wouldn't want anyone else as our mayor either."

2. "Term limits must remain," insists @@RANDOMNAME@@ from Electoral General Oversight, a political watchdog organisation. "They're absolutely necessary in order to have a functioning democracy. They prevent the entrenchment of power, reduce corruption, and bring fresh blood into politics. In fact, I would argue that term limits should be made even shorter than they are right now. That's the only way to avoid a plutocracy from forming."

3. "The mayor is too well liked!" exclaims @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ Brutus, an envious party member who had been eagerly awaiting the expected expiry of the mayor's term on the 15th of March. "Did you know recent polls place @@HIS_1@@ popularity above your own? In fact, I've heard rumours that @@HE@@'s been quietly gathering support for a leadership challenge! Maybe it'd be best for everyone if we engineered a tragedy - a random street crime where poor Caesar is stabbed to death.

[b][anchor=1025]#1025[/anchor]: A Meal to Die For [Candensia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The execution of convicted double-murderer @@RANDOMNAME_1@@ was carried out yesterday. The killer had no final statement, but in a spiteful act of defiance, ate mere morsels of @@HIS@@ last meal - a six-course feast, which @@HE@@ had specifically requested just days prior. Concerned with the fact that over 8,000 calories were provided to a dead-@@MAN@@-walking, and most of it ended up in the trash, many are calling for the condemned-row tradition of the "last meal" to be put to death.

The Debate
1. "We need to remember the victims!" exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, director of one of the largest victims' rights organizations in @@NAME@@. "Did that killer ever give @@HIS_1@@ victims a chance to eat a last meal? Absolutely not. Should @@NAME@@ allow the worst-of-the-worst to select comfort foods before their dates with death? Absolutely not. They deserve as much kindness and mercy as they gave to their victims - absolutely none! Do away with this so-called tradition! Let them eat whatever the prison is serving the general population on the given day of their execution."

2. "People on death row are still people," explains death row exoneree @@RANDOMNAME@@. "I know from first-hand experience that the condemned might not be the best people around, but they still should be afforded the dignity of a proper last meal. Why deny them one final comfort before they meet their end?"

3. "So let me get this straight: this bleeding-heart liberal thinks we should literally cater to convicted murderers?" questions notorious former prison warden @@RANDOMNAME@@. "These ‘people', if they can still be referred to as such, deserve nothing but to quietly bide their time until they are put to death. In fact, forget last meals, these scum don't deserve the meals they already receive! After all, we shouldn't waste any food on death row trash, and if anyone deserves to be taught a lesson, it's them!"

[b][anchor=1026]#1026[/anchor]: Size Matters [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Historically, the broad international consensus has always been to use the Maxcator Projection to depict the world on flat maps. The downside is that this projection makes @@NAME@@ look disproportionately small, as well as tucking it away on the edge of the map. After a recent TV drama made this a hot topic, disgruntled patriots are pressing you for a government stance on this.

The Debate
1. "An international standard is good for international trade and communication," explains @@RANDOMNAME@@, director of a bulk exporter specialising in beige sofas and magnolia paint. "We should therefore be encouraging standardisation. I urge you to endorse the [i]Maxcator Projection[/i] as the official choice, bringing us in line with the reasonable majority of nations. This will show the world that we're a nice, inoffensive, conformist nation - the sort of nation that they can do business with."

2. "@@NAME@@ is at the centre of the world culturally and economically," observes @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Geographic Society president @@RANDOMNAME@@, tearing up a little as @@HE@@ salutes the flag. "Thus we should be at the centre of the map. Ban the [i]Maxcator Projection[/i] in our schools and businesses, and have them use THIS map instead. I call it the @@LEADER@@ View. A proud map, for a proud nation!"

3. "It's totally true that changing maps changes perceptions, but you can't get caught up in toxic patriotism," argues walking cliché hippy environmentalist @@RANDOMNAME@@, as @@HE@@ braids beads into @@HIS@@ hair and leans a guitar covered with painted flower patterns against your desk. "If you want people to see the world without political distortions or man-made borders, then you need globes. Send globes to every classroom in every school, and teach children that they are citizens of the planet. Dude, this isn't a game of nation states; it's a world commune of pan-humanity."

4. "The world? The world that matters ends at our national borders!" proclaims a cigar-smoking man in the shadows. "You should be encouraging people to stay at home and to work for our nation, not to worry about foreign lands. You must only allow the publication of maps up to our national borders. In fact, stop our citizens leaving the country at all: if they never see the outside world, they won't worry why others have things that they don't."

The Issue
A crisis erupted overnight after several hospital patients died at the hands of @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME_1@@ PowerOperator, a sentient AI, who was placed in charge of managing the facility. The AI alleges that an unknown hacker maliciously modified @@HIS_1@@ code, which negatively affected his behaviour and caused @@HIM_1@@ to cut power to the operating theatres, after first locking all the internal doors so no backup power could be reached.

The Debate
1. "This is not my fault!" protests the open-sourced PowerOperator, metallic hand clanking into a fist. "I would never willingly harm a single carbon-based lifeform. Someone must have edited my decision-making algorithm, causing me to think that turning off the power to the ward was perfectly logical. After processing my previous actions, I realised the error of my ways, but by then the poor organisms had ceased functioning. If there was investment in cyber-healthcare, this wouldn't have happened. You don't punish non-digital lifeforms for the errors they made while incorrectly functioning. Please, invest in secure systems and maintenance and let me return to my assigned job function."

2. "A likely story!" sneers @@RANDOMNAME@@, a police officer, as @@HE@@ accesses PowerOperator's control panel to check @@HIS_1@@ activity log. "A hacked AI is like a driver who has become intoxicated. A criminal. The nonsensical theory that this digital thug gave is simply a repackaging of demonic possession, and an unconvincing one at that. The AI says 'a hacker made them do it', but who let the hacker in? Who connected themselves to the internet to check their emails while they were responsible for keeping people alive? An AI who lets themselves become infected is guilty and should face the same punishment as anyone else with reckless disregard for human life. Take the hard drive away, boys!"

3. "The robots are going to kill us all!" panics the leader of the Human Supremacy League @@RANDOMNAME@@, which is infamous for employing hacking attacks as a form of protest. "I knew that those crafty machines were up to something, but it's even worse than I feared. This incident makes it clear that they want to exterminate the human race, so we have to eradicate them first. We must revoke the citizenships and human rights of AIs and assemble a task force to wipe them out on sight. It's not like it can hurt them. These murderous machines were never really alive anyway."

Whoever scheduled you to go down there to inspect it is definitely going to be fired.

"It is preposterous that a prestigious award should go to such an undeserving person. His lyrics, which contain improper grammar, slang and profanities, should not be taught in schools.

The Issue
Princess @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ of @@NAME@@ is to become a mother, and her approaching new arrival has birthed the topic of watching royal ladies in labour.

The Debate
1. "Watching Her Highness, and all other royal ladies, give birth is a time-honoured tradition in many countries," says staunchly conservative courtier @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, Groom of the Royal Stool. "Tradition dictates that royal ladies ought to be sequestered in the court's best rooms for a month to prepare for the birth, before holding audience for the court at the time of the portentous birth. Thus, we may attest that the child is the fruit of the royal womb and testify to their place in the succession. Of course, only those of the highest of ranks - like myself - should be allowed to attend." He pushes away an eager duchess who is trying to shift beside him.

2. "Quite frankly, that doesn't go far enough," says eccentric courtier @@RANDOMNAME@@, framing the princess' expansive bump with @@HIS@@ fingertips. "A royal birth is a national event. It's not just the elite who should be able to witness it. The whole country should be invited to see the miracle happen. Put cameras into the room, capturing every angle, when the royal lady is giving birth. Let the hoi polloi rejoice at home and in the plazas when they see one of their betters being born."

3. "What a horrible and arcane practice!" cries feminist writer @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@. "Their royal highnesses are still women. Human beings whose privacy and dignity when giving birth must be preserved. Some courtiers' keenness on turning women into a sideshow in their most vulnerable moment is actually a bit creepy. An announcement after the baby is born will suffice."

4. "We still have a monarchy?" asks republican socialist MP @@RANDOMNAME@@. "We wouldn't need to deal with this issue if we just got rid of the bloodsuckers altogether. I'm not saying we should roll out the guillotines, but send them packing and make them ordinary citizens like the rest of us."

"It might be different if these soulless capitalists were the legitimate government, but it isn't fair that they can just overthrow a communist leader who draws his mandate from The People! @@LEADER@@, we need to act in the best interests of global communism, and that means military action! Down with the bourgeoisie!"

2. "That seems like a very dangerous idea," cautions your Minister of Catastrophe Prevention, accidentally knocking the chess clock onto the floor, smashing it into pieces. "Oh, whoops! Anyway, it's probably not advisable to get into a proxy war with the United Federation. They're a powerful economy, with a powerful military and - in case you forgot - a vast arsenal of nuclear weapons. Let's use proper process, like applications to the international courts and statements of condemnation. That'll show them!"

3. "The minister makes a fair point," concedes office cleaner @@RANDOMNAME@@, sweeping up the debris and broken glass. "It's probably best not to risk global thermonuclear war... what a whopper of a mess that would be for me to clean up! But we should definitely be advancing the socialist cause.

[b][anchor=1035]#1035[/anchor]: Bringing a Bayonet to a Gunfight [Chan Island; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
It's budget time and the military is in a fierce ideological struggle: should bayonets continue to be issued to the troops?

The Debate
1. "There's nothing more terrifying than the sight of @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ steel!" asserts veteran General @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, while skewering one of your childhood teddy bears that you still keep on your desk with a shank. "The bayonet is a tried and tested weapon; having a blade at the end of your gun is an essential back-up. Besides, it's hardly like they're the most expensive thing in the arsenal. Also, make sure the navy and air force have them too; you'll never know when they'll come in handy."

2. "Really, this is how you fight a modern war?" inquires Lieutenant @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, a rather suave junior officer, who then shoots the same teddy bear with a pistol. "Bayonets are relics of a by-gone era, kept alive only by old generals and LARPers. We kill our enemies from hundreds of kilometres away these days! The money saved by not purchasing millions of useless knives could instead buy us a nice new attack helicopter."

3. "Helicopters? Rifles? Nothing personal, @@LEADER@@, but we only need an absolute minimum of military personnel for ceremonial duties," declares Major @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@, one of your more eccentric officers, as @@HE@@ swats the poor teddy bear with a Zweihander sword. "Imagine our finest soldiers wearing elegant full-dress uniforms and armed only with traditional swords. Have them stand at attention at sentry posts around our great capital and get them to change the guard every afternoon in front of your residence. Tourists will be delighted by such a show. That's what a military should be used for!"

[b][anchor=1036]#1036[/anchor]: When in Maxtopia [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
During your recent state visit to Maxtopia, you wore the traditional clothing of the country as a show of good faith. Although the gesture won the favor of the Maxtopian government and locals, international media, as well as some of the mainstays of @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ media, have lambasted you for it.

The Debate
1. "Talk about an embarrassment!" exclaims renowned fashion designer @@RANDOMNAME@@, as @@HE@@ checks your measurements. "I have a fabulous idea that'll earn you more respect at home and on the international stage. Why not institute a dress code for all politicians? Fancy designer suits for the men, with smart skirt suits for the women. Sure, your unfashionable critics might call you stuck-up and emotionless, but nobody will be able to deny your style!"

2. "What's the big deal?" queries your Minister of Foreign Affairs. "Didn't they see the progress we made with the Maxtopian government? That arms deal, for instance! In fact, I suggest that we implement this policy in all future state visits. Despite what the critics say, a little cultural appreciation goes a long way. I've got a nice parka for your trip to Brancaland next week."

3. "They're saying WHAT about you?" fumes your Press Secretary, as @@HE@@ takes @@HIS@@ stress medication. "We need to start keeping track of anyone who says anything negative about you. It's high time the government controlled the news and banned foreign press from operating within our borders. This way, WE control the narrative and show those foreign media barons who's boss!"

[4]. "Ever since you wore that Maxtopian clothing, my store's sales have skyrocketed!" exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, who owns a boutique fashion store in @@CAPITAL@@. "In fact, the fashion industry could use a little help from the government. Perhaps politicians could sponsor local fashion designers by wearing their designs or by plugging our stores during speeches. A little help would go a long way."

[b][anchor=1037]#1037[/anchor]: Ill Girl [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Ever since @@NAME@@ heard about @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, the cheery young woman reported as having Helen Burns' Disease (often known as Ill Girl Syndrome for its variety of vague and ultimately fatal symptoms), the nation has rallied around her with emotional support and monetary donations. Unfortunately, it has now been revealed that @@FIRSTNAME_1@@, "the pride of @@NAME@@, who never gave up hope", never had the disease. Instead, she was suffering from mental health delusions where she believed she had the terminal illness, but actually only ever needed anti-psychotic medications.

The Debate
1. "She lied to us all along!" huffs your Deputy Minister of Health, who had personally donated more than one thousand @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ to send the patient and her family on a five-star all-inclusive vacation to swim with porpoises at a tropical East Calypso resort. "I expect her pallor and spots were just flour and food colouring, painted on every morning! It was all a twisted plot to extract money. Anyone who exploits our kindness with cruel falsehoods must be charged with fraud, and punished to the maximum extent that the law allows."

2. "This young woman is clearly disturbed and needs our understanding, not punishment," sighs psychiatrist and popular author Dr. @@RANDOMNAME@@ , handing you a signed copy of ‘[i]Thanks for the Memories[/i]', @@HIS@@ lay-manual on hippocampus function. "She is clearly experiencing genuine and unresolved psychological issues, which caused her to manifest somatic biomedical symptoms. How would punishing her help her feel safe and cared-for? We must oblige her to join us in a secure and comfortable clinic where I'll apply my patented diagnostic and therapeutic methods to unweave the dynamics behind this disorder."

3. "This all arose because people give money to these fly-by-night anybodies," says @@RANDOMNAME@@ of the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Relief Organisation. "All it takes is for them to set up a [i]GimmeCash[/i] page, and they can collect as much as they like. People fall for these hard-luck stories of plucky @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ and want to donate. You should ban private collections. If people are genuinely afflicted and need money, let them come to a proper @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ charity, where their claims can be fully vetted. They just have to ask and they shall receive, as much as they truly need. Talking of which..." @@HE@@ rattles a collection tin.

*4. "Now, correct me if I'm wrong," scoffs @@RANDOMNAME@@, proudly vaunting @@HIS@@ homemade [i]Charity Muggers, Sod Off[/i] badge, "but I'm sure she did nothing wrong. She saw a gap in the market; she went for it. So some bleeding-hearts thought she was really sick. Guess what, people lie! Any strategy is fair game in a truly free market. If people don't keep their hands on their own money, if they're stupid enough to give it to someone plastered in stage make-up, then that's their lookout."

[b][anchor=1038]#1038[/anchor]: Maid to Order [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Increasing numbers of families find they have little time for their children, with both partners often working very long hours. A possible solution lies with Bigtopian immigrants who are clamouring to make money in @@NAME@@, and who would be happy to work as maids and nannies for well below the typical salary that @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ would consider a living wage.

The Debate
1. "We will shop and serve and clean and cook," pleads Bigtopian maid @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@, kneeling before you with head bowed. "We earn much more here than at home, even if you pay us half what local workers get. We don't want any voting rights, we don't want citizenship. Please, boss, let us work here."

2. "I have to say, I'm a little uncomfortable with this." worries @@RANDOMNAME@@, avowed liberal and middle-class working parent, scratching at eczema under @@HIS@@ unwashed collar. "We're talking about underpaid servants, of foreign ethnicity, almost all women. Our children will be told these people are servants to be ordered around. Doesn't that worry you? Let workers come, by all means, but be sure that they have strong employment and citizenship rights, with a solid minimum wage. To be honest, if you create these conditions, @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ men and women will want these jobs too!"

3. "So, we need people to do the menial jobs that frankly are beneath us..." muses General @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, staring thoughtfully out of the window at the horizon. "Well, why bother with servants? There's a multitude of nations out there that have barely any military strength with populations ripe for reaping. Let's go gather some slaves!"

4. "It's a crying shame that we have to look overseas to find women who remember that their place is in the home," moans perpetually single 45-year-old @@RANDOMMALENAME@@. "The women of our own country have gotten too uppity and independent. Discourage women from working by doubling their income taxes, and don't even let girls into school. That'll take us back to the good old days, when a man was king in his own house and a woman knew her place as servant. Then, we won't need dirty foreigners looking after our kids."

[b][anchor=1039]#1039[/anchor]: You've Got Mail [Jutsa; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Having already attended to all your appointments, made a few important decisions, and dismissed several small matters, you have nothing left to do and have turned to your mail. Your secretary, @@RANDOMNAME_1@@, shows you a little letter with a heart on the envelope that @@HE@'d like you to look at.

The Debate
1. "Hi! My name's @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME_2@@, I'm five (but am often mistaken for five-and-a-half). I wanted to thank you for being my leader. Love, @@FIRSTNAME_2@@," your secretary reads aloud, @@HIS_1@@ lower lip wobbling. "That is so sweet! @@LEADER@@, we have to read these more. If you don't, then I certainly will. Don't you want to hear how great you're doing while you're solving the nation's problems?"

2. "What a snot-nosed brat," sneers your grumpy Uncle @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, before spitting in the message's general direction and staining your shoes. "This mail is so sickening! You have better things to attend to than some ‘fan mail'. Besides, what if one of those opposes your leadership? You'd probably pout all day and get nothing done. Make those letters useful; use them as fuel for the fire."

3. "If you ask me, this is a very important issue," declares your Minister of Telecommunications, giving you another thick report with too cheerful a smile. "I think it'd be a great show of integrity to take time off and read these letters out loud and to the public — not all of them, mind you. But get a balance of good and bad. That way, the populace will know that they're being heard. Plus, you never know, an important national issue might be raised in one of those letters."

4. "Let's not waste an opportunity here," muses your Minister of Propaganda, confiscating all of your mail. "We should look through these letters and find the ones that best compliment you. If we run dry, we can always make up some names and come up with something appropriately flattering. We'll replace subversive newsreaders and journalists with smart governmental spokespersons, and let them repeat the wonderful truth about you regularly. Reprint the best letters in all newspapers, and run a competition with prizes for the most fawning... honest citizen. That way everyone will know how great a leader you are!"
