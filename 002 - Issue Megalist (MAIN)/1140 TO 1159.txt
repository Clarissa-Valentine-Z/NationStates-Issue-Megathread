[b][anchor=1140]#1140[/anchor]: Blinded by the Light [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
It is a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ tradition to light up one's home with demonstrative holiday lights during festive seasons. While this has always been a distractive issue for drivers, one rather competitive neighborhood in @@CAPITAL@@ caused quite a stir. The strobe lights and military-grade lasers used in several displays caused multiple traffic accidents and temporary blindness, prompting a national discussion on this issue and scores of lawsuits.

The Debate
1. "These lights must be banned!" demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ unintentionally smacks your interns with @@HIS@@ walking stick. "My life has been disrupted by temporary blindness because some idiot thought it was a good idea to use strobe lights! The government must step in and ban all of these eyesores before they hurt anyone else. What's so fun about staring at some lights, anyway?"

2. "Come on now, you can't be serious!" scoffs personal injury lawyer and five-time winner of [i]Best Light Display in @@CAPITAL@@[/i], @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What about the holiday spirit and our freedom of expression? You can't ban something that people have enjoyed for years just because a few people end up getting hurt! You'd be robbing @@NAME@@ of a very important holiday tradition. Besides, these injuries are great for business."

3. "Compromise, everyone!" exclaims your Minister of Compromises, who has been appearing in far too many meetings recently. "I agree that banning holiday lights is a ridiculous idea, but at the same time we can't ignore the risks to public health and safety. So how about we mandate that the manufacturers tone down the brightness in their lights and ban the sale of military grade lasers and excessively bright strobe lights to the public? That way people still get their lights and nobody risks getting blinded! It sure beats spending the holidays in a hospital."

4. "The problem isn't lights! It's drivers!" complains safety advocate and leader of the [i]Mothers Against Everything[/i] protest group, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Even during regular days we have careless drivers going way over the speed limit, putting our children's lives at risk. Cars must be banned from suburban roads! That's what will reduce accidents, not banning lights!"

[b][anchor=1141]#1141[/anchor]: The Trolley Problem [Verdant Haven; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
After the public poll to name @@CAPITAL@@'s newest trolley line was handily won by a tired and insincere meme response, making it the sixth consecutive poll with similar results, the mayor has come to your office begging for an official stance on naming procedures for public projects.

The Debate
1. "Trolley McTrolleyface?" sighs the mayor dejectedly. "I have to ride to work on Trolley McTrolleyface? I wanted 'The @@ANIMAL@@ Express,' but no, we're stuck with this boring nonsense again. Instead of throwing open these polls to every juvenile delinquent or obnoxious 'Grick and Morgy' fan, could we please establish some boundaries? How about a committee of respected citizens to vet the choices that are on the ballot? That way the people get their say, and we get some dignity!"

2. "Remind me again why we let the public vote on this stuff at all," interjects your Auxiliary Regional Subaltern for Naming Things. "The government foots the bill, the government has the responsibility for maintaining our nation's image, and the government should choose the name! Heck, perhaps you should just name the next project after yourself!"

3. "Are you kidding me? These names are great!" bubbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Communication Director's intern, while excitedly checking your metrics. "This isn't civic failing, it's civic engagement! If some silly names are all it takes to get citizens fired up and interested in public works, then isn't that worth it? Who cares if it's a bit repetitious – it's great for our optics! Besides, if we really are a democracy, we have to respect the people's vote."

[b][anchor=1142]#1142[/anchor]: Womb Service [Pirate States of Morgana; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
A recent article published in [i]The @@CAPITAL@@ Times[/i] featured a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ woman who's had her second abortion in two years, with both procedures having been covered in full by the nation's public healthcare system. The national debate that's followed has become impossible to ignore.

The Debate
*1. "I'll be dammed if this doesn't keep coming up every couple years," sighs a representative from the Womb Tang Clan, a leading abortion advocacy group. "Sneaking around in bathroom stalls is for politicians, not for women seeking legitimate healthcare! We need to keep abortion safe and legally accessible to all women, especially the vulnerable women who are most likely to need more than one abortion and would be most impacted by any attempt to limit or defund abortions. @@LEADER@@, we must mandate full healthcare provision of these vital, life-saving services and fund the distribution of free contraception to all women in @@NAME@@." [[color=blue]Contraceptives are legal[/color]]

*2. "I'll be dammed if this doesn't keep coming up every couple years," sighs a representative from the Womb Tang Clan, a leading abortion advocacy group. "Sneaking around in bathroom stalls is for politicians, not for women seeking legitimate healthcare! We need to keep abortion safe and legally accessible to all women, especially the vulnerable women who are most likely to need more than one abortion and would be most impacted by any attempt to limit or defund abortions. @@LEADER@@, we must mandate healthcare provision of these vital, life-saving services. Also, if you'd allow family planning services to distribute free contraception that is actually effective — not just leaflets about [i]Selma the Sexually Continent Squirrel[/i] — that could really help." [[color=red]Contraceptives are illegal[/color]]

3. "Well, I never!" gasps renowned socialite Ms. Effie Beauregard-Sessile, dropping what appears to be a pair of opera glasses. "Murdering babies is healthcare now? Whatever is this world coming to? If we're going to make @@NAME@@ great again, we can't be seen funneling tax money towards fetal genocide! We need to respect innocent, unborn @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ children by making abortion illegal under any circumstance and prosecuting these witches as the murderers they are." She pulls out a folding fan and begins fanning herself with dainty flicks of her wrist.

4. "I have no objection to little ladies getting an abortion," chortles Stan Li, striding into the center of the room while tipping his Stetson to the previous two speakers. "But listen, @@LEADER@@, my... erm, our tax @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ shouldn't be spent covering all these preventable health problems. If a negligent individual has any adverse health outcome — an unintended pregnancy, diabetes, heart disease, cancer — well, that's their choice and their right! But it should also be their responsibility. The national health service should only pay if people did [i]nothing[/i] that could have possibly brought on their illness."

5. "Let's all agree that one accident can happen, right? But not learning something from that, having a second unintended pregnancy..." A cloaked figure from the back of the room steps into the light, a sneer spreading across his lips. "Well, that kind of woman cannot be trusted with the responsibility of self-management society granted her. If any woman should ever want a second abortion, the government should only fund it if she agrees to a simultaneous sterilization procedure."

The Issue
The long arm of the law has finally caught up with the most notorious burglar in @@NAME@@, with investigative diligence revealing that the man who stole the ceremonial staff from parliament was almost certainly William @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, better known as 'Burglar Bill'. The only problem is that forty years have passed since the crime.

The Debate
1. "The principle of a statute of limitations is important to due process," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a defence lawyer and civil rights expert who recently managed to get serial killer 'Psycho Pete' released on compassionate grounds. "After so many years, the case for prosecution is no longer viable. Witness accounts can no longer be considered reliable, and physical evidence will have deteriorated. Also, the suspect is now a frail, old man who has certainly committed no crime in decades. The police were clearly incompetent in their inability to bring a prosecution to bear within a reasonable timeframe. Any outcome other than dismissal of the case would be a grave injustice."

*2. "You don't stop being guilty just because time has passed," insists @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Head Warden at @@CAPITAL@@ Prison as @@HE@@ runs @@HIS@@ truncheon along the radiator in your office. "This man is a common thief and shouldn't be allowed to get away with what he did. It cost the state a lot of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ to replace the ceremonial staff, not to mention the national embarrassment it caused us. Put this criminal where he belongs – in jail!" [Unknown Validation]

*3. "Burglar Bill is awesome!" announces your brother, as he adds the latest addition to his Burglar Bill scrapbook, which he has had since he was a kid. "The daring break-in into parliament, avoiding the cops for four decades - this man knows his stuff! You should make Burglar Bill your Chief of Police; his inside knowledge of the criminal underworld makes him the perfect fit for the job." [Unknown Validation]

[b][anchor=1144]#1144[/anchor]: A Noble Cause for a Fight [Fardhin; ed: Altmer Dominion][/b]

The Issue
Seemingly unprovoked, the renowned Lord Ota Novumaga has attacked a neighboring barony in Western @@NAME@@ with his own private army. As noble tensions increase and rumors of a civil war brew, your court and office have become a battlefield of conflicting ideals.

The Debate
1. Lord Ota Novumaga enters your court and bows in deference. "The Lord in question had plans to attack neigbouring estates, putting the safety of the entire region at risk. If you may grant me a title of knighthood, @@LEADER@@, I will pledge my sword and loyalty to protect @@NAME@@. I have faith that other aristocrats shall also answer duty's call!"

2. "Ota is a very ambitious man," sneers Lady Macbed, the wife of one of your advisors. "Be careful about giving him too much authority. Keep in mind, he acted in a reckless manner — a sorry sight indeed. Do not be so willing to offer up the milk of human kindness to that man. A different reward for his service could possibly be offered, if only a pittance to send a message. Perhaps rewarding him with only half of the land of the Lord he stopped?"

3. "The problem is the lack of a central authority," your brother suggests, casually flipping through the latest edition of 'Prince Charming Magazine'. "Now, I'm not saying you're a bad leader. It's just that the nobles don't see you as a credible one. You need a lesson in projecting confidence; crack some heads to show these aristocrats who's boss. All the nobility will have no choice but to bow down to your authority."

4. A military man struts into your office amidst a group of peasants singing a very catchy song about 'angry men'. "Leader, I am George Bonaparte, a nobleman who will speak for the people. @@NAME@@ is infested with incompetents who inherit titles rather than earn them. They feud among themselves having done little for the people they are supposed to lead! Do the right thing and abolish feudalism and the nobility, unless you want the masses who have long stayed silent to finally rise up in arms against you!"

[b][anchor=1145]#1145[/anchor]: Your Wild Self(ie) [Altmer Dominion; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A nature photographer on assignment in the Kawandalandian wilderness caught @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@ toying with their spare camera equipment. Either on purpose or by accident, this @@ANIMAL@@ managed to snap a selfie. Upon returning back to @@NAME@@, the impressed photographer began to sell copies of the selfie to interested buyers. As news of the so-called 'smart @@ANIMAL@@' continues to spread, animal rights activists have raised some surprising copyright concerns.

The Debate
1. "That picture is not this photographer's intellectual property because @@HE@@ did not take it," bluntly states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a philanthropist with a long record of donating to conservationist causes. "It is morally wrong that @@HE@@ profits from this work. While I will admit that the picture in question is intriguing, @@HE@@ has unfairly earned enough already. If this portrait continues to be distributed, I humbly request that all future proceeds go completely towards a good cause. My philanthropic foundation, perhaps?"

2. "This is an affront to @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ everywhere!" howls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a spokesperson for the organization [i]People for the Ethical Treatment of Everything[/i]. "There is only one individual with the right to all earnings from this photograph: the noble creature who took it! That brilliant beast did the work, so they should be fully recognized for their intellectual property. I expect the necessary @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ will be delivered to the wild soon, post-haste."

3. "Just hand that photograph over to us," sternly orders Doctor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, director of the National Science Laboratory. "This can be an amazing PR opportunity! There must be something special about that selfie-taking @@ANIMAL@@, having the ability to photograph themselves and all. With your permission, let my team bring the star-studded creature back to the lab for testing. That photograph will become the public face of the most groundbreaking discoveries of the decade, mark my words!"

4. "Whether @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ or beast, we are promoting a culture of selfishness and unchecked narcissism," complains self-styled intellectual and motivational speaker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I don't know where this is going to lead us, but it won't be anything good. This selfie and 'me first' culture that's corrupting our society needs to be nipped in the bud. Ban selfies and encourage people to engage with each other and their communities."

[b][anchor=1146]#1146[/anchor]: Mother Knows Best? [Sacara; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
A recent report from the Bureau of Population Statistics has revealed that, during the past quarter, the number of parenting licenses given to prospective parents fell to an all-time low.

The Debate
1. Your secretary, who has failed the parenting test four times in a row, is eager to speak to you about this. "I mean, come on! How was I supposed to know how long it takes for a baby to get to the center of a lollipop? The test shouldn't be so impossibly hard that no one can pass it. And there are so many other restrictions and requirements that get in the way of people trying to be parents. I beg you to make it easier for a regular person to obtain a license. I promise I will raise my children well!"

2. "Seems like we're running a country full of idiots, doesn't it?" complains the head bureaucrat of the government agency that awards parenting licenses. "The application process is doing its job if it keeps those who are unqualified from having children. If there is one child in the hands of a parent without their wits intact, then we have failed as a nation. Instead of making the process easier, we need to be even more selective. And we should monitor the progress of parents even after they get their licenses, just to make sure they're parenting up to standard. Only the best, brightest, and most qualified deserve to raise a family."

3. "Licenses? We don't need no stinking licenses!" yowls your Minister of Productivity, writhing and jumping around you. "Less children — bad! Less productivity — bad! Bad for economy! We always need to be producing, always need to be doing! More children, more doing!" The minister's mouth froths as @@HE@@ mumbles on the floor, making bizarre thrusting motions.

[b][anchor=1147]#1147[/anchor]: The Long Walk [Nation of Quebec; ed. Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Though @@RANDOM_NAME@@ was subsequently exonerated for the many crimes that @@HE@@ was accused of, videos of the "perp walk" @@HE@@ made between the police station and the court are continuing to surface online and in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ media.

The Debate
1. "Perp walks are barbaric and needlessly cruel," states criminal justice reform and privacy advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while covering @@HIS@@ face with a paper bag. "Not to mention a total violation of privacy. Why should people endure the humiliation of that long walk with cameras flashing in their faces? What if the person is innocent? At least let them have their dignity before you lock them up in a cold, metal box."

2. "On the contrary, privacy is less important than transparency of procedure," replies a tough-on-crime police officer who would rather not be named. "The people and the free press have a right to know the creeps who are committing crimes in our great country! In fact, we ought to make perp walks more harrowing! Have the criminals walk a whole mile before they're escorted away, and let onlookers jeer and throw rotten fruit at them! That'll surely teach people that crime doesn't pay!"

3. "Obviously, we need to strike a balance between the two extremes," suggests armchair legal expert @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why not limit perp walks to only the most heinous of crimes and wait until after they're convicted? That way the media gets to have its circus, but only when we say they can."

[4]. "Are we forgetting the fact that an innocent person was humiliated?" reminds @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@'s lawyer. "My client's life was destroyed by police incompetence and cruelty. The government must compensate all falsely accused people for any time spent incarcerated in police cells, and force disciplinary procedures onto the police officers who allowed this charade to take place. Maybe then the police will think harder on respecting the public's right to dignity!" [??? Maybe Compensation Lawsuits]

[b][anchor=1148]#1148[/anchor]: Unfit for Purpose [Nuremgard; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The Department of Welfare has been criticized for the way it assesses potential claimants of disability benefits. The department sends out agents from private companies to force claimants to perform what critics call "cruel and humiliating" assessments in order to prove they need the benefit.

The Debate
1. "This is disgusting and inhumane," furiously shouts wheelchair-bound claimant @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "That person who came to assess me wasn't even a licensed medical professional in my area of care. @@HE_1@@ was a former optician! Does it look like my eyes aren't working? @@HE_1@@ made me roll up and down my hallway until my arms got tired, then told me I didn't need the benefit because I could roll along the floor on my own without difficulty! End this now. A note from your doctor or other relevant professional should be enough evidence to claim disability benefit. It's not as if they'd lie."

2. "The system works just fine," claims your grey-suited and stoic Welfare Minister. "We have to carefully screen every claim, otherwise every scammer and skiver would try to con the government out of money for every cut and scrape they have. Make the assessments more stringent, and properly fund my department. That way, it'll deter the con artists and only the truly disabled will receive assistance."

3. "I think a lack of empathy is the problem," suggests a random passer-by who happened to overhear the meeting. "I'm not against the principle of assessing clinical needs, but we need to make it fairer on claimants. I heard one story of one of those agents asking a suicidal person how they would kill themselves if they were to do it. We should ensure that all assessors have the same disability as the claimant, which will ensure they are treated humanely and fairly, as well as making sure that the assessor has a good understanding of what the condition entails."

4. "This is all just a waste of time and money!" exclaims self-styled Social Darwinist and anti-government crusader @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Think of the suffering taxpayers! Where are our benefits, hmm? We're the real victims here, not these lazy slackers on disability! Abolish their welfare payments and let natural selection work things out."

[b][anchor=1149]#1149[/anchor]: The Goriest Advertisement [Chan Island; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The world was shocked by videos of a Bigtopian rebel army massacring a village... using weapons with "Made in @@NAME@@" proudly branded on them.

The Debate
1. "Another happy customer!" declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the manager of a large firearm factory, beaming with pride. "Look how pleased that gentleman is at his @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE_INITIALS@@XP-7631 battle rifle's stopping power. Just as advertised, it is making mincemeat of that mother and baby! Hey, speaking of advertisement, can we use this footage please? I think videos like these are fantastic at showcasing the quality of our awesome products."

2. "Hm... perhaps too good an advertisement," says the factory's assistant manager, while watching a video of a tank rolling over a man's head. "While the rebels' choice of a Model 5 @@ANIMAL@@ tank was an excellent one, maybe we should have our name... well, you know, not written onto the vehicle's hull that boldly. We should have a regulation to scrape off our weapons' origins when selling them abroad. That way, only gun nuts will know about our role in these... um... occurrences."

3. "Oh come on, you idiot!" screams infuriated weapons designer Koch Winchester at the screen. "Do you want to get blood jamming your pristine shotgun? Because beating an old woman to death with one is how you get that! Guns are for shooting, not... ugh. Hey, @@LEADER@@, it's clear that these foreigners don't know how to use our goods properly. You should ban all sales abroad and only sell our weapons to the fine people of @@NAME@@. Be sure to loosen up those gun laws first!"

4. "That's ridiculous!" cries the Bigtopian ambassador. "If anything, these atrocities are proof that our great country needs more aid in crushing these rebel scum. You should mandate that only legitimate governments can purchase your arms. [i]We[/i] certainly don't get involved in such gratuitous violence in more than 30% of the towns we liberate. That way, you will instead see your nation's name being used for good, not this disgusting stuff. Mostly."

5. "Wait just a minute!" shouts @@RANDOMAME@@, your Minister of Non-Violent Solutions, who appears to have just smashed @@HIS@@ way out of a storage room after being locked inside by your Defense Minister. "Why do we even have a weapons industry? Look at the destruction it's causing. This world would be a better place without our weapons and the accompanying bloodshed. I say that we must shut down every munitions factory in the nation - regardless of the cost!"

The Issue
The progressive nation of Skandilund is threatening to place trade sanctions on your nation due to their strong stance against interrogative torture.

The Debate
1. "It's nothing against you, @@LEADER@@. It's just that we don't want our nation to be associated with... well, torture," shivers Mia Blondin de Root, a prim and proper diplomat from Skandilund, glancing suspiciously at the red marks on the hands of one of your aides who scalded themselves on a hot coffee pot. "You understand, don't you? We trade with you, and we look like we're endorsing your actions. Of course, if you considered abolishing these medieval practices, then I'm sure we could set this matter aside and even encourage our allies to trade with you."

2. "Ouch, sly - that's an ultimatum," your aide whispers, as the Skandilunder leaves. "If they're too soft and touchy to be associated with us, then we should forget about them. Maybe we push for trading more with morally flexible nations like Maxtopia? At least they're not snobs, like these preachy liberal forest hippies."

3. "We could just pretend to end and renounce torture!" exclaims your Minister of Creatively Augmented Interrogations. "All we need to do is hide our activities in an island detention camp somewhere off the coast, torture and interrogate prisoners for answers, and make sure to kill them when we're done with them! Win-win! We get to trade with everyone, and as long as we keep up with plausible deniability, everyone can look the other way."

[b][anchor=1151]#1151[/anchor]: Gotta Go Fast [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
When the Holy Month of Golden Bloom rolls around, members of the Tranquillity of Yellow observe fasting: neither eating nor drinking anything from dawn till dusk. @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, your Minister of Labor, has reasoned that fasting leads to a loss of productivity and potentially endangers lives.

The Debate
1. "I mean, it's a no-brainer, isn't it?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, still chewing the big bite @@HE@@ took of @@HIS@@ mouth-watering chocolate lava cake. "These people fast for an entire day, and everyone knows that prolonged hunger and dehydration can cause concentration problems. What if a Yellowite surgeon operated on a patient while fasting and made a mistake? Human lives come before religious duties. Hence, all Tranquil Yellowites should be banned from fasting if they want to keep their jobs."

2. "How dare you meddle with my freedom of religion!" gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Yellowite preacher, flourishing a staff topped with an ornamental sunflower at the Labor Minister, while casting a yearning glance at @@HIS@@ cake. "I have practised fasting since I was a child, and I can assure you that it doesn't compos- compres- I mean compromise our cognitive abilities. Also, daytime fasting isn't actually unhealthy you know - there's growing evidence that it reduces a number of ailments and could even prevent cancers. It would be both spiritually and physically good if you told all @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ to join the Fast of the Holy Month of Golden Bloom."

3. "Let's not be hasty; I'm sure there is room for a sweet compromise here," chimes in @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Creative Solutions. "I agree that suffering from thirst and hunger for a whole day can cause problems in the workplace. But instead of banning our Yellowite citizens from fulfilling their religious duties, we could give them paid leave during the Holy Month of Golden Bloom, so they could safely fast in the comfort of their homes. To safeguard equality, we can make similar accommodations for all faiths: extra vacations for pilgrimages and regular prayer breaks at work."

[4]. "This whole fasting thing is sacrilege!" exclaims Papa Luigi, a well-known pizzeria owner and a member of the Cult of Pizza, flailing his arms dramatically. "Only infidels would dare to starve themselves in blatant defiance of the Holy Crustiness of Pizza Margherita. We should prohibit all forms of fasting and endorse a force-feeding procedure for those who restrict their food intake for whatever reason. Pizza for @@NAME@@! Pizzazz for @@NAME@@!"

The Issue
A report in today's news suggests that the recent martial arts craze may be getting out of hand after the latest in a series of incidents left over a dozen people in @@CAPITAL@@ needing hospital treatment.

The Debate
1. "One moment, it was just two teenagers arguing over which had shoved the other in the cinema queue to see [i]Knuck Chorris Meets Big Drago[/i], then, as fast as lightning, just about everybody in sight was fighting!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a bruised and shaken businessman who's being interviewed at the scene. "Not just kids, but shoppers and commuters too, kicking and punching each other, and doing poses like Drunken @@ANIMAL@@ right there in public! It was a little bit frightening. The government ought to ban teaching that sort of thing, and shut down all the Bojos or Hojos or whatever they're called."

2. "Ahh, so a few young whippersnappers got a bit too lively," comments @@CAPITAL@@'s gruff and aging police chief. "What's needed isn't trying to stop folks from learning how to fight, because they'll always be doing that whether they call it Kung-Fu or Kung Pao or just plain old brawling. What's needed is more police on the beat with better funding for our own training and gear. To keep the peace, of course."

3. "If this humble one, whose name is Master Po, might be heard?" suggests a passer-by with a long white beard that touches the ground, speaking to a broadcasting reporter. "The true problem is not that so many people are learning these arts, grasshopper. It is that unfortunately too many of their teachers have been focusing solely on the arts' physical aspects without also instructing their pupils in the underlying philosophical principles that would lead those people away from welcoming violent confrontation. I suggest making the teachings of the Seven Sages of Old a core part of this country's education system - not just for those who would then learn to fight, but for everybody who would learn anything. This is the wisest answer available."

[b][anchor=1153]#1153[/anchor]: Side Effects [Candensia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
@@ANIMAL@@ Pharmaceuticals, a major international drug company based in @@NAME@@, was recently linked to illegal human experimentation and an organ harvesting cult in the underdeveloped, jungle nation of Kawandaland. Its atrocities exposed, the company has gone bottom-up, throwing @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ markets into turmoil, and largely eliminating access to inexpensive medical supplies in Kawandaland.

The Debate
1. "@@ANIMAL@@ Pharmaceuticals was both dealing diphenhydramine and defiling human rights," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ ambassador to Kawandaland. "While they should have stayed with the former, we cannot allow this to cause a fatal reaction as far as @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@-Kawandalandian relations are concerned. Let's begin medical aid shipments to their country. While it might not be cheap, such an action may yet preserve our honor in the eyes of these noble people."

2. "Oh, I'd love to bandage up Kawandaland too, ambassador," chimes in @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a top-level official in the Finance Ministry. "You do realize that our economy is being wounded by this catastrophe as well, right? I agree that the situation in Kawandaland is a sad one, but we must save ourselves while we still have the chance. Instead of spending millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ on medical aid, we should use those funds to stabilize our markets.

3. "The actions of my former employers are quite repulsive, and have left quite a mess," admits @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former representative of @@ANIMAL@@ Pharmaceuticals. "Do not despair for I have a fast-acting, extra-strength, non-drowsy method to resolve this! If the government could nationalize the pharmaceutical industry, then it's only a matter of time before the markets rally back and we can eventually shift our interest back towards Kawandaland."

[b][anchor=1154]#1154[/anchor]: Foreign Tax Credits Leave Film Industry Reeling [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
More and more @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ film studios are turning to Brancaland due to the generous tax credits of the picturesque coastal city Maxhoover. Industry representatives and local patriots alike have prompted calls for action.

The Debate
1. "CUT!" shouts controversial film director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, known for @@HIS@@ unapologetic patriotism and xenophobia, who is coincidentally filming a scene in your office. "@@LEADER@@, if I may be frank, why don't we punish these unpatriotic hacks? They show a complete lack of respect for our culture and take jobs away from hardworking citizens. Can't you put these people on some sort of watchlist and create some sort of committee to assess their loyalty to @@NAME@@?"

2. "What is it about these debates that always attracts crazy extremists?" sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the mayor of a lakefront city in @@NAME@@. "As much as I'd love for my city to be the face of the film industry, how can we blame these studios for going over to Brancaland? They offer generous tax credits, their people are friendly, and their environment is ranked as one of the best in the world. What we should be doing is offering tax credits of our own to encourage film crews to shoot movies and shows right here at home. Oh, and would it kill you to help us clean up the city? The streets and parks are littered with trash!"

3. "There's no need to get your unmentionables in a twist aboot this," suggests eccentric Brancalandian talent agent Mike Shatner with long pauses between his words. "I'll have you know that actors are one of Brancaland's primary exports. In return we offer tax credits and the best studios that money can buy. Unless you want to risk damaging your country's relationship with Brancaland and deny your people some quality acting, like the award-winning [i]Spit @@LEADER@@ Says[/i], I suggest you make it easier for studios to choose Brancaland over @@NAME@@. By the way, was that a great impression of you, or what?"

4. "I would like to suggest that we advertise @@NAME@@ to a classier audience," remarks snooty independent film director @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while sipping on a glass of Brancalandian Red. "You don't want the riffraff making @@NAME@@ look like a bunch of uncultured hicks with explosions and gore-fests, do you? With generous investments in the industry, we can attract the right audiences and weed out the boorish undesirables. You could even host yearly film festivals in @@CAPITAL@@ to encourage more people to film in our exquisite city!"

[b][anchor=1155]#1155[/anchor]: The Banquet of Walnuts [Verdant Haven; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
A massive church scandal has begun unfolding internally after a number of religious leaders and other supposedly holy individuals were found to have participated in an evening of debauchery and licentiousness, the specifics of which are in strict conflict with many core teachings of the faith. Featuring illicit companionship, suggestive dancing, and candied walnuts scattered about the floor for use in shockingly immoral ways, the salacious details of this banquet will surely shake your people's faith to its core.

The Debate
1. "We must make examples of these reprobates!" roars @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Ministries, from the portable pulpit that @@HE@@ is always being wheeled around in by @@HIS@@ assistants. "Our faith must show no tolerance for those who deviate from the true path. The perpetrators must be cast out from our nation and into the fires of anywhere but here! They are sick, twisted, and didn't invite me!"

2. "The people won't lose their trust if we make sure they don't hear about this in the first place," murmurs a shady-looking individual slowly rolling a pair of walnuts in his hand. "We just need to hush up what happened, and quietly have the offenders moved to other dioceses so this doesn't happen again... at least not with the same witnesses. If anybody comes forward publicly, we'll accuse them of fabricating it all!"

3. "Is it really so bad?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the official who happens to own the house where the party occurred. "I mean honestly, if the higher power is synonymous with love, what could be more divine than sharing one's love with a few dozen strangers? @@NAME@@ should embrace our activities and teach the populace that all love is good love!"

[4]. "Honestly, the state shouldn't entangle itself with the private activities of the church, just as the church should stay out of matters of government," flatly states the nearly forgotten Minister of Secular Affairs. "Besides, if our religious leadership can't follow our religion, how can we trust them to guide our country? Perhaps it's time to give secular leaders back their power... say, why are you grabbing that pitchfork?" [[color=purple]Must have Low Religiousness?[/color] TBD.]

[b][anchor=1156]#1156[/anchor]: Pet Theory [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A video recently made the rounds on crowdfunding websites, showing a disease-ridden elderly @@ANIMAL@@, clearly in great distress. This was accompanied by a commentary from the owner, pleading for donations to help pay for the medical treatment that @@HE_1@@ couldn't afford.

The Debate
1. "Animals can suffer just as much as humans can," explains @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, the pet owner in question, hoping that it was clear this was an observation rather than a suggestion. "Happily, crowdfunding paid for poor Lucky's treatment, even though he didn't make it. For the future though, I think there should be a National Veterinary Service to provide health care for all domesticated animals."

2. "Oh come on, they're just things! They don't have feelings!" laughs teenager @@RANDOM_NAME@@ whilst pulling the wings off a fly. "Their health is their owner's cost to cover. If this idiot couldn't afford to look after @@HIS_1@@ @@ANIMAL@@, @@HE_1@@ should have let it die, or just disposed of it."

[3]. "We can be balanced about this, and provide something for animals while boosting the economy," offers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of fast food chain [i]BurgerThis[/i]. "My company will offer free euthanasia to any sick animals brought to our slaughterhouses, so long as we can keep the remains. You just need to loosen a few bureaucratic regulations, and the problem will be gone." [[color=blue]Must not be vegetarian[/color]]

[b][anchor=1157]#1157[/anchor]: Rodney and Julietta [The Free Joy State; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The unlikely romance between your nephew Rodney and Princess Julietta, the second daughter of the King of Moltevino, has been the talk of @@REGION@@ for many months. However, it hit a snag when the young couple decided to make a long-term commitment. Moltevino refuses to sanction such a match, as your nephew is not of royal blood.

The Debate
1. "The King of Moltevino extends his noble hand in friendship," declares Moltevino's ambassador Lord Capello between tightly clenched lips, half-bowing. "Our fair kingdom has been enriched by exports of our many grape-based products and would like to share that glory through a favorable trade agreement. The King has one small request in return: lock your threadbare juggler of a nephew away from the Pearl of Moltevino, burn all his mad-headed ravings of love, and keep that rancorous coxcomb confined until he has foresworn all ties that he claims existed between himself and the Princess. Her Radiance isn't a hedge-born puterelle who should be consorting with commoners! No offence intended."

*2. "Pathetic little Moltevino is trying to push us around?" scoffs the Minister of Ego-Boosting. "You could spit from one side of their country and hit the other side! Their only notable export is wine. Granted, it's damn good wine, but we still have Marche Noire. Let good old Princess Jules come and live in @@NAME@@. What are the Moltevinans gonna do? Invade us to get their 'Pearl' back? With what — their army of three pensioners, two cowards, and one courageous golden retriever named 'Cuddles'? I'd like to see them try!" [[color=blue]Alcohol is legal[/color]]

*3. "Pathetic little Moltevino is trying to push us around?" scoffs the Minister of Ego-Boosting and Teetotalism. "You could spit from one side of their country and hit the other side! Their only notable export is wine. I mean, it's damn good wine... I've heard. But we don't want that stuff in our dry country anyway! Let good old Princess Jules come and live in @@NAME@@. What are the Moltevinans gonna do? Invade us to get their 'Pearl' back? With what — their army of three pensioners, two cowards, and one courageous golden retriever named 'Cuddles'? I'd like to see them try!" [[color=red]Alcohol is illegal[/color]]

4. "Fair Moltevino has so much more than wine," exhorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Minister of Culture, as @@HE@@ holds up a brochure. "Look at this: meandering river cruises through wine country, historic architecture, Lovers' Clock in the [i]piazza vecchia[/i]. Perhaps an influx of tourist cash might be the tie that binds this lovers' knot, through a story that shouldn't be forgot. The young couple could settle in their preferred nation, and in return we would help promote Moltevino as a major tourist destination. Lots of sightseers visiting romantic places can put a smile on even the grumpiest of kings' faces. For never was a story marketed better, than that of Rodney and his Julietta."

5. "Oh, just become a monarch," shrugs your laziest nephew, @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, who's just been fired after one day at his latest in a long line of jobs. "Come on, you waving to the people from balconies, talking about 'royal unions between two nations, both alike in dignity'... folks'd love it! Then Rodney would be 'His Royal Highness Rodney of @@NAME@@' and I'd never have to work again... I mean, and he could be with the Princess. Wouldn't that be cool?"

[b][anchor=1158]#1158[/anchor]: Flying Into a Rage [Australian rePublic; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Two passengers were both accused of going on drunken rampages on two different flights. When they each faced the same judge on the same day, one was sentenced to two years in prison while the other was issued a small fine and a stern warning. The only apparent difference between the two is that the first was a man, and the second was a woman.

The Debate
1. "This is sky-high sexism," complains @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, brother to the convicted man. "Both people here pleaded guilty to and committed the same crime, but were treated totally differently! The system is discriminatory against men, and must be changed! Sentences should be based on the crime, not the perpetrator's gender!"

2. "This man is being ludicrous," counters Judge @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "When sentencing, we look at a wide range of factors. These include assessment of statistical likelihood of repeat offence, and the aggression of the individual. The law is not black and white, and I judged that this 120-kilo skinhead male was more likely to reoffend than the mild-mannered and charming young lady in the sensible suit. Judicial discretion is essential in sentencing, and must be respected."

3. "Why dost thou think it so ill if a maiden receiveth a more lenient sentence than a knave?" questions armourclad medieval re-enactor @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, as he hands out pamphlets about the benefits of chivalry. "Menfolk are more capable of tolerating prison than the weaker flowers of femininity, and our poor ladyfolk art needed back at the hearth to tend to the children, and to their womanly duties! Spare the weaker sex the indignity of gaol, I beseech thee!"

[b][anchor=1159]#1159[/anchor]: The Sad State of Affairs [Jutsa; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
Some @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are circumventing the ban on adultery by marrying anyone they'd like an affair with. Once the excitement of the relationship is over, the lovers will often then have nothing further to do with each other.

The Debate
*1. "These morally deficient sex addicts are making a mockery of the sanctity of marriage," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hand-in-hand with his two wives. "A marriage is supposed to be a sacred bond of trust between two, or more, people for life. You should make these legal adulterers pay by having them live with their partners until the day they die – no divorce, no separation, nothing! If they don't comply, they should be charged with adultery and receive the full punishment!" [[color=blue]Divorce is legal[/color]]

*2. "These morally deficient sex addicts are making a mockery of the sanctity of marriage," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hand-in-hand with his two wives. "A marriage means you're supposed to support your lovers for life. You should make these legal adulterers pay by having them live with their partners until the day they die – no separation, no vacations away from one another, nothing! If they don't comply, they should be charged with adultery and receive the full punishment!" [[color=red]Divorce is illegal[/color]]

3. "This was bound to happen," cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a leading monogamy advocate and author of the controversial book [i]I Do, Not We Do[/i]. "Having multiple spouses is just cheating on your one true love. Make everyone choose one spouse, and only one spouse. That's the way to true peace and marital harmony."

4. "Consent is the word to remember," blurts out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your cousin's first and least favourite spouse. "You know why? Because if someone feels the need for a bit — ahem — extra, they should have the full consent from every spouse involved. Legally documented and informed consent will put to bed the troublesome issue of illegal extramarital affairs."
