[b][anchor=1400]#1400[/anchor]: President No [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
You have called for a meeting in an attempt to resolve "the missile situation" without any further escalation.

The Issue
Surprisingly, the United Federation has accepted your request for a diplomatic summit. After a long flight, you have arrived in Granfalloon, the dusty and impoverished capital city of San Vitenzo. Several dignitaries are already waiting to speak with you.

The Debate
1. "Ah, the red menace has arrived!" smirks President Ken J. Finnedy, who was handing out miniature United Federation flags to the local residents. "The proud industrialists of the Federation stand united against warmongering commies like yourselves. Frankly, we're tired of putting up with your capitalist-shaming calumny. I insist that you remove all of your nuclear missiles from this island and send them back to your own godforsaken country before you get into any worse trouble."

2. "Let's not start off on the wrong foot," calls out San Vitenzo's sandal-clad President for Life, "Doc" Moreno, as he walks up to you and pulls you aside. "The hard-working people of our nation need protection from the imperialists of the world who would take advantage of us. We certainly appreciate your generous support. However, these nuclear missiles have just turned us into a target. What if you and Finnedy were to each remove some of your weapons that were near the other party's borders? If your missiles on this island were to disappear, I think I could talk Finnedy into removing all of his nukes from Eagleton Air Base — which I'm sure is too close to @@NAME@@ for comfort. Now... while you're here, have you ever heard of boko-maru?" He looks at your feet and removes a tape measure from his pocket.

3. As you are about to return to your hotel room, a young woman approaches you and starts speaking rapidly. "Excuse me! My name is Ramona Moreno — President Moreno is my father. Papa is too proud to admit it, but our people are starving. Since he'll never ask for it directly, I will: we need massive amounts of food and medical aid. You're supposed to be our ally, but I get the feeling that you don't care about our people; you're just taking advantage of our location in case you need to launch missiles at the United Federation. Well, without your assistance, we'll soon have to ask for help from the Federation — which means they will force us to adopt ‘free markets' and sell off all of our limited resources at rock-bottom prices. Please negotiate a missile removal plan with my father — and then send us as much aid as you can afford."

[b][anchor=1401]#1401[/anchor]: Leave and Let Die [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
You are currently participating in a diplomatic summit on San Vitenzo.

The Issue
During today's negotiations, you told the enemy you were willing to withdraw your nuclear weapons from San Vitenzo without expecting anything in return. Your shocked advisors have confronted you to get clarification about that particular stance.

The Debate
1. "This was all some sort of negotiating strategy, right?" questions Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich, who looks like he's on the verge of a panic attack. "We can't just give in to their demands all of a sudden! Do you know how weak that makes us look? President Moreno has generously offered to negotiate with the United Federation to remove some of their nukes that are in range of @@NATION@@. If you're determined to withdraw from this conflict, we really should take him up on his offer."

2. "I thought we agreed to quit threatening other countries with violence and destruction?" admonishes Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, thrashing out an improvised version of ‘Paint It Violet' on her guitar. "Send Agent Milanova home, and let's get out of here. Who cares if we can't hit them with nuclear weapons? Maybe if we started minding our own business and working to make @@NAME@@ a better place instead of spending so much on the military, they wouldn't feel so threatened by us."

[b][anchor=1402]#1402[/anchor]: You Only Negotiate Twice [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
You agreed to remove your missiles from San Vitenzo in exchange for the United Federation removing their missiles from Eagleton Air Base.

The Issue
After a series of secret negotiations, everyone has shaken hands and made a commitment to disarm. You and an aide have met with President Ken J. Finnedy in a beautiful glass-fronted conference room in San Vitenzo to sign the final agreement.

The Debate
1. "Good morning! Are you ready to make history? Let me just get my ceremonial signing pen." Finnedy reaches into his coat pocket and removes not a pen, but a Smyth & Weston revolver, which he points directly at your chest. "Have you noticed that world leaders like ourselves never get frisked for weapons? I can't remember the last time I had to go through a metal detector. Seems like a security flaw, don't you think? Well, I digress. I hope you didn't actually expect me to remove my own missiles. You see, I didn't get to be President of the United Federation by giving up power every time I had a disagreement with someone. Real leaders do whatever it takes to seize power and claw our way to the top. Although I firmly believe that the only good commie is a dead commie, this isn't personal — it's just politics. As soon as you're dead..." Suddenly, the window shatters as Natasha Milanova crashes into the room in a hail of glass fragments, closely followed by her @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ flag parachute. Milanova leaps toward Finnedy, kicks the revolver out of his hand, and slams him into the floor. "I hope you don't mind me dropping in, Comrade Leader. Your aide pressed the panic button — and I see that mister Imperialist in Chief is up to his old tricks. Well, here's how it's going to go, Finnedy. I discovered your plans to send an armada to @@NAME@@ to bombard us. To prevent that from happening, I secretly removed a warhead from one of your nuclear missiles before it was loaded onto a submarine at Libertyville. I handed it off to one of my colleagues, who has hidden it in your capital city, ready for detonation at a moment's notice. Either you sign that agreement and follow through with each of its terms, or your ‘glorious free-market paradise' is going to be a victim of your own hubris. Are we clear?" Finnedy nods and quickly scribbles his name on the agreement. "Good. Now get out of here and don't threaten @@NAME@@ ever again, or your capital will become a radioactive crater faster than you can say ‘hedge fund manager'." Milanova turns toward you as Finnedy and his aide scurry out of the room. "Let's go home, boss."

[b][anchor=1403]#1403[/anchor]: Tomorrow Never Arrives [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
You have ordered an attack on the United Federation's troops in San Vitenzo.

The Issue
The enemy's soldiers and ships have been completely wiped out, thanks to your advanced military technology. Unfortunately, the United Federation seems to have interpreted your actions as an unforgivable assault upon their nation. Moments ago, one of their ballistic missile submarines approached the surface near the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ coastline... and fired its entire arsenal of nuclear missiles at targets throughout @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "HOLY VIOLET! GET TO THE BUNKER! RUN!" A flood of screaming people push you downstairs and through a long hallway, stumbling into the fallout shelter beneath your office. The door clanks shut as the last staff members sprint through the reinforced threshold. Your defense minister shambles over towards you, head in hands. "Well, we're screwed. @@CAPITAL@@ is finished. I'm not even sure this bunker can withstand a direct hit. On the bright side, our nuclear missiles on San Vitenzo are now ready for launch. Which of the United Federation's cities do you hate the most?" A nervous guffaw escapes from his lips.

2. "No... we can't do that to the poor workers," murmurs Andrea Gramyki, devoid of guitar, her voice barely above a whisper. "The United Federation is filled with people like us. The oppressed, pre-revolutionary laborers won't ever have a chance to rise up and fight the imperialists if we wipe them from existence. Don't retaliate, Leader. The violence has to stop somewhere. By the way, it was an honor serving with you." A single teardrop runs down her face.

--------------------------------------------------------------
[b][anchor=1404]#1404[/anchor]: Die Some Other Day [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
You and your staff are huddled into an underground bunker, waiting for the end to come.

The Issue
The minutes pass in relative silence. Occasionally, the stillness is punctuated by a sniffle or a whimper that seems amplified in the confined space. A few distant rumbles can be heard, but nothing that sounds like the expected obliteration of everyone's hopes and dreams. Suddenly, Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich's voice cuts through the rising tide of whispered conversations. "What the hell? Comrade Leader, we've got an incoming call."

The Debate
1. Malinovich steps away from the control panel where he was entering the coordinates for targeted enemy cities and ushers you over to a nearby phone, where a red light is blinking. He presses a few buttons to put the call on speakerphone. "Leader? Is that you?" The static-obscured voice of Natasha Milanova is barely audible, causing Malinovich to frantically increase the volume. "I followed up on those enemy plans that I told you about. The officers were plotting to send an armada to bombard @@NATION@@ with the ships' guns. Captain Duffle was assigned the advance patrol mission near our coastline. I managed to sneak aboard his submarine before it left. As the diplomatic conflict intensified, Duffle was constantly arguing with Commander Harrigut, his second in command. Captain Duffle kept shouting that @@NATION@@ was a threat that needed to be taken out preemptively. Even after some sort of ‘satellite incident,' Commander Harrigut wouldn't support any retaliation that would lead to mutually assured destruction. Captain Duffle accused his officer of treason, pulled out his sidearm, and shot him in the head, then took his nuclear launch key. Duffle and the remaining officers immediately launched all of the ballistic missiles straight at @@NATION@@. Fortunately... I had already disarmed each of the warheads." Milanova's closing words are obscured by a deafening cheer from the people surrounding you.

[b][anchor=1405]#1405[/anchor]: Spectrum of Solace [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
The enemy's nuclear weapons failed to detonate due to the courageous actions of your secret agent.

The Issue
Although the United Federation remains angry with you due to recent events, they have insisted that they did not intend for things to escalate this far. As an apology for this sobering occurrence, their contrite government has arranged peace talks in an attempt to defuse the situation.

The Debate
1. "I'd like to personally apologize for the... um... missile incident," admits President Ken J. Finnedy of the United Federation, looking more sheepish than you have ever seen him. "Captain Duffle was definitely not authorized to initiate a nuclear strike or take any action that would result in our mutually assured destruction. He and his officers have been relieved of duty... permanently. As a token of our goodwill, your agent who managed to infiltrate our submarine will be returned to @@NAME@@ unharmed. If you are willing to sign a non-aggression treaty and pay reparations for the brave warriors of freedom who were needlessly killed, I think we can put this whole unpleasant situation behind us. What do you say?"

2. "Sure, go ahead and sign their treaty, but it's not enough," sighs Andrea Gramyki, who is softly playing ‘Sweet Home @@CAPITAL@@' on her guitar. "This incident clearly proves that weapons of mass destruction can no longer be allowed to exist. I spoke with my counterpart in the United Federation, and it appears that they are also willing to disarm if we do the same. It's a bold move, but I think you're the sort of brave visionary who can lead us into a new era of peace, free from the scourge of WMDs."

3. "You've practically destroyed our island!" weeps President "Doc" Moreno of San Vitenzo, who is incongruously wearing a suit jacket and tie with shorts and sandals. How are my people supposed to ‘put this situation behind us' when you've bombed their houses and crops into oblivion? Even Almighty Bokonon won't be able to undo this calamity. After you sign whatever treaty the United Federation is offering, you must allow our people to settle in @@NAME@@... and give us a little cash to ease our troubles. Isn't that what allies do for one another?"

*4. "Reparations! We're not paying any stinkin' reparations!" blusters Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich, who has turned a rather alarming shade of red. "Have you forgotten how they almost annihilated us? Yes, we would have done the same thing to them if it weren't for that phone call from our secret agent — and we definitely killed a bunch of their solders. What did they think would happen when they invaded our ally? This treaty is just a slap in the face — and we're definitely not disarming or letting in waves of immigrants. You need to walk away from the negotiating table, and hit them with sanctions for good measure. They're our enemy forevermore."

*5. "Reparations! We're not paying any stinkin' reparations!" blusters Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich, who has turned a rather alarming shade of red. "Have you forgotten how they almost annihilated us? Yes, we definitely killed a bunch of their soldiers. What did they think would happen when they invaded our ally?

[b][anchor=1406]#1406[/anchor]: Can't Touch This [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Prohibition has driven alcohol underground, and bootlegging is on the rise. Moonshine and gin are being illegally supplied to speakeasies and private parties across @@NAME@@, and anyone who is anyone knows that mobster Mark Scarpone is the man running the show. Scarpone has been hard to prosecute, though, as there's no direct evidence linking him to the booze black market, and no-one seems willing to testify against him.

The Debate
1. "We need to get Scarpone off the streets, and see his criminal empire broken up," demands Prohibition Enforcement Officer Hayley Etness, bursting into your office, slamming her fists on your desk, and demonstrating half a dozen other angry cop clichés. "The only charge we can definitely make stick is a parking violation... but maybe we can arrange for the sentence he receives for that infraction to reflect the crimes we all know he committed but can't prove. Put him away for ten to twenty, and we'll be striking a blow against organised crime!" [[color=red]Must have prisons?[/color]]

2. "We need to eliminate the Scarpone problem, and see his criminal empire broken up," demands Prohibition Enforcement Officer Hayley Etness, bursting into your office, slamming her fists on your desk, and demonstrating half a dozen other angry cop clichés. "Not being able to prove wrongdoing has never stopped us enforcing the law in the past. I need officers with guns and body armour to end Scarpone and those like him with extreme prejudice! That'll teach him to defy the laws of our land!" [[color=blue]Must not have prisons?[/color]]

3. "That's kind of... uh... yeah..." worries politico Cassidy George, clutching his light green felt hat to his chest. "Don't we always say ‘innocent until proven guilty'? What we need is more oversight and due process here, to ensure that we don't compromise on the values of justice that make our nation great. I'll happily head an investigatory committee, and we can review the information at hand, and I'm sure that two to three years down the line we'll have put together something to justify a search warrant or two, so we can build a sounder prosecution case. Accountability, right?"

4. "Mr. Scarpone is an upstanding businessman with many links to the community," offers Scarpone's lawyer Eddie O'Rabbit, who seems to speak entirely out of the side of his mouth. "Now this personal cheque here just so happens to be equal to the exact amount of money that would have been paid in corporation taxes this week if all this bootlegging were happening, and if Mr. Scarpone were involved. Which he ain't. Say a cheque like this were to turn up every Sunday, then that'd be a good thing, capiche?"

5. "Men like Scarpone are just parasites, but the root cause here is prohibition itself," points out your Undersecretary for Trade, who has suspiciously boozy breath. "People want a drink. Is that so bad? Re-legalise alcohol, and legitimate producers can leave the Mob with no black market demand to exploit. I'll drink to that!" He raises a bottle to his lips, which is conspicuously labelled ‘PLAIN APPLE JUICE'.

[b][anchor=1407]#1407[/anchor]: New Tricks [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
It's Trickster Night, a global event made popular in the United Federation but with its roots in ancient religious practices, where children dress up as ghouls and ghosts and play pranks if not given a sweet treat. You are making your way to your front door, when a small child draped in a sheet stops you.

The Debate
1. "Twick or tweat, twick or tweat, gimme somefin good to eat," she lisps, holding up a small bucket already half filled. "If you don't, I declare, erm... it will be not fair. Wow! You're that person wiv all the power. My pawents talk about you all the time. They say, ‘Can't that dum-dum do anyfin wight?' Listen, I love Twickster Night. It's my favouwite holiday. Can you give all kids a day off school, so we can make weally good costumes? Then we can show evewyone how fun it is."

2. "Shoo, you bothersome brat," mutters your Uncle @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, putting one sour lemon drop into her bucket and dragging you inside. "This pranking is what I want to talk about. Children running around, creating mayhem, demanding rewards for no work. What happened to industriousness? To children being neither seen nor heard? Clamp down on this ridiculous imported holiday. It's harassment to allow your child to demand sweets with menaces. Issue heavy fines to any parent who lets their wretched hellion out of the house on Trickster's Night."

3. "My child, I'm so glad you're here," says your mother, entering with a tray and opening the door to place six chocolate bars into the bucket of the little girl who is still crying outside. "I'm tired of putting up with Wei's nonsense. But I do worry about all those children, wandering alone. Streets can be so unsafe. I say we encourage families and schools to hold Trickster Night costume parties with buffets, toffee apples, gift bags of sweets... dancing, if there's time. Then, the little ones could safely enjoy their evening."

4. "Be not one with the ghouls, lest ye become a ghoul!" howls your niece, stepping forward to deposit a graphically bloody religious tract into the little girl's bucket. "This Night of Tricks is, itself, a trick. It softens our resistance to evil, encourages us to don the robes and face of the devil, and makes us forget that the mask we wear is what we are! We must ban this demonic day, and the sale of all costumes that let your citizens pretend to be devils, harlots or other evil people. Kandorith must stand unified, praying together against this evil."

5. "Ah, my favourite night of the year, all screams and sweets," comments your brother, menacing the little girl with a realistic toy axe as he snatches the bucket of candy from her, and slams the door shut in her face. "Delightful japes if someone doesn't give you enough sweets, or gives you the wrong ones. Nothing makes someone feel more alive than a good scare. Except the lady who collapsed — ah well. Let's make it a mandatory national holiday for all. No more pretending to be out. Get everyone's adrenaline pumping with some larks, like neighbours jumping out with chainsaws. Everyone — especially me — would get [i]so many[/i] sweets. Talking of which, I reckon you were a little light this year, so..." Grinning, he steps back to reveal your most important papers rendered unreadable by a dozen rotten eggs.

[b][anchor=1408]#1408[/anchor]: (A Lot Of) Pennies for Your Thoughts [Fauxia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
No one in @@NAME@@ imagined that the "March Against Zoning Proposal CWA221, Part 19, Clause F" would attract the thousands of protestors it drew; it just seemed like too niche an issue to raise controversy. As it turns out, a large number of the protestors were paid participants, marching with no interest in the actual issue beyond their fee.

The Debate
1. "Paid protest makes a mockery of the democratic process, making political power dependent entirely upon wealth and connections," blusters old money oligarch and MP @@RANDOMNAME@@, who authored the offending proposal. "There's no reason to allow this, and it should be a criminal offence to pay or be paid to protest."

2. "I don't see what's wrong with it," argues property developer @@RANDOMNAME@@, whose planned housing estate is going to be obstructed by the new legislation. "In a mature capitalist democracy, people should march for whatever reason they choose. And if someone wants to pay a few hundred others to protest, then that's just them democratically expressing their strength of feeling. What's wrong with that? Shouldn't we have an intelligent and independent populace?"

3. "I understand the potential for corruption," remarks disabled mum-of-three @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, "but some people don't have the mobility or the ability to join in a protest march. Or someone might care about an issue, but be too far away to join in a protest, or want to donate to support a cause, but not be able to get time off to march. Doesn't everyone have a right to have our voices heard? I suggest that you can restrict this practice to allow each non-attender to hire one single proxy to protest in their stead. Just establish some sort of registry, and you can ensure fairness."

4. "Let's be smart about this," suggests that crazy-looking @@MAN@@ who always seems to interject at the end with an off-the-wall idea. "You should take advantage of paid protest, and use government funds to pay for marchers that express love for your chosen policies. Any protests against you will be drowned out by your supporters, and the press will report that public opinion is on your side. Of course, we have to make sure no one leaks anything, with NDAs and hidden paper trails and the like. As long as no one leaks the truth we'll be fine."

[b][anchor=1409]#1409[/anchor]: Happy Pranksgiving! [Verdant Haven; ed: Noahs Second Country][/b]

The Issue
The wildly popular @@DEMONYMINITIALS@@BC television series Prankyard Wars has long depicted a lovable team of practical jokers attempting to out-do each other with harmless mischief. However, following a recent dip in ratings, their increasingly elaborate antics led to the accidental incineration of a public park, several houses, and most of the local fire station's equipment.

The Debate
1. "It was just a prank, @@LEADER@@!" wails one of the jokers in question, @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ "@@ANIMAL@@-Butt" @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@. "You can't hold us liable for it! We just thought ‘FOOF' sounded like a funny chemical name... you know, like ‘You got FOOFed!' How were we supposed to know it makes pretty much everything it touches burst into flames? People need to lighten up and consider our intentions before grabbing their pitchforks!"

2. "Dioxygen difluoride is one of the most dangerous chemicals in existence. We cannot allow this kind of irresponsible behavior!" roars police chief @@RANDOMNAME@@?, wildly flailing about with @@HIS@@ baton. "They cannot possibly have acquired it without knowing exactly what it does! Let me bring them up on chemical weapons charges, and we'll see who's laughing when they get convicted as the terrorists they are. We must have zero tolerance for these so-called ‘pranksters.'"

3. "We all know that the people making the decisions aren't the screen talent, but the producers!" interjects four-time Golden @@ANIMAL@@ winner @@RANDOMNAME@@, head of the Performers' Guild. "They control the purse strings, so they are responsible for the content! You should fine them for forcing these poor performers to endanger themselves like that, and maybe toss in some criminal charges to boot. Nobody should have to risk their safety just to get a paycheck."

4. "Now, let's sit down and have a nice fireside chat together," rolls the soothing sentiment of @@RANDOMNAME@@, the unusually charismatic head anchor for @@DEMONYNMINITIALS@@BC News. "I am certain we can negotiate a settlement that will make all parties happy. If you look the other way on any laws that may have been broken, we can ensure that everything will be rebuilt better than before, and I can toss in some positive coverage of your current legislative efforts."

[b][anchor=1410]#1410[/anchor]: Lives On-Line [Verdant Haven; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
After a @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ hospital quietly paid out in a recent ransomware attack, numerous other hospitals across @@NAME@@ have been targeted by criminals hoping to cash in. The unknown perpetrators behind these attacks have demanded large quantities of bytecoins to provide decryption keys, causing hospital administrators to desperately seek guidance from law enforcement.

The Debate
1. "We swore an oath to help people in their hour of need," affirms Dr. @@RANDOMNAME@@, the chief physician of one affected hospital, while @@HIS@@ colleagues nervously nod in agreement. "Lives are on the line, and if we don't regain access to these files, there will be fatal consequences. Life-saving surgery will be delayed, medications will get mixed up, and there's no telling what kind of vital records will be lost. We don't have any choice but to pay, right?"

*2. "You can't possibly suggest giving in to terrorists!" cries out @@RANDOMNAME@@, an adjuster for @@CAPITAL@@ Hospital's insurance provider. "It's a matter of principle not to reward bad behavior. We've already seen that if you pay, it will just happen again and again! It's more important to refuse every claim than to pay out on the off chance it will save somebody. Did I say claim? I meant demand. Refuse the terrorists' demands!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "You can't possibly suggest giving in to terrorists!" cries out @@RANDOMNAME@@, a bureaucrat at the State Assets Insurance Bureau. "It's a matter of principle not to reward bad behavior. We've already seen that if you pay, it will just happen again and again! It's more important to refuse every claim than to pay out on the off chance it will save somebody. Did I say claim? I meant demand. Refuse the terrorists' demands!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "We may be able to crack this code," murmurs Deputy Chief @@RANDOMNAME@@, head of your electronic crimes unit. "I'm going to need a few dozen engineers, unfettered access to the network, and all the computing power you've got! In the meantime, you should force hospitals to set up better cyber-defenses, and fine the heck out of any that allow security breaches."

5. "This would never have happened with pen and paper!" declares a bureaucrat who seems to have worked for the government longer than you've been alive. "Leave all the computers and the internet and the saggy pants and the hippity-hop to those young folks who don't know better. When lives are on the line, you can't be online. Tell vital services to stick to good, old-fashioned handwriting — then they'll be safe from those nasty folks on the web."

[b][anchor=1411]#1411[/anchor]: Atomic Split [Daarwyrth; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
With your government allowing provinces to formally secede, East @@ANIMAL@@land has declared its intention to become a sovereign state. However, the territory contains several military bases, and more importantly, a large portion of your nation's nuclear stockpile.

The Debate
1. "Well, Violet on a popsicle stick!" blurts your Minister of the Interior, as he drops his half-gnawed spaghetti-on-a-skewer in shock. "Honestly, you need to establish some ground rules around this secession scheme of yours! We need to immediately deny East @@ANIMAL@@land's request for independence, and the same goes for any other region or province that holds anything of importance to our nation's continued existence. Either they'll happily remain a part of our nation or we'll make them stay, by force if necessary!"

2. "Come now, old friend, surely you don't want to be seen doing anything as draconian as that?" coos the self-appointed Minister of Shakedowns for the hopefully-soon-to-be-independent nation of East @@ANIMAL@@land. "Once you sign that declaration of independence, we'd be more than happy to give back those radioactive poppers of yours in return for a generous farewell donation to our new treasury. Surely any cost will be worth getting your shiny, deadly toys back, no?"

3. Your Minister of Intelligence, whose body paint matches the room's wallpaper, whispers into your ear. "Don't be startled, it's me, N! There's another solution, you know. You'll sign their declaration of independence to keep up appearances, and I'll mount a covert operation to infiltrate the military bases holding our WMDs to render them non-operational. Sure, East @@ANIMAL@@land will still have the husks that they could potentially reverse engineer, but it'll buy us at least a few years to build up an even deadlier nuclear arsenal!"

The issue:
While attempting to buy an Eckie-Ecola at your local convenience store, you are shocked to discover that after a recent bout of severe inflation, the shopkeeper is no longer accepting @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ in favor of the much more stable United Federation Dollars.

The Debate:
1. "I can't say I'm surprised," sighs your Minister of Finance, who happens to be standing in line behind you holding an Addison Cola and a fistful of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@. "We've been spending far beyond our means, so the Central Bank's had to print more cash to make up the difference. We'll need to slash government expenditure across the board to get a handle on our debt. It'll be a bitter pill in the short run, but if you hold the line and commit to spending less in the future, I promise you it'll ultimately save the patient."

2. "Wouldn't it be easier to declare the United Federation Dollar as legal tender alongside the @@CURRENCY@@?" suggests the shopkeeper while she gives a dirty look at your wad of cash. "Sure, it will be hard to give up a bit of control and pride, but everyone will have a stable currency to rely on. We could even keep all the spare @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ lying around as a novelty for tourists!"

3. "We wouldn't have this problem if the currency was pegged to something of real value," says an old man while he peruses a bag of Arthur's Original from the candy aisle. "Back in my day, you could go to any grocery shop and buy a goat for a tuppence, with enough change for a bag of turnip candy, which was all we had in those days unlike your fancy butterscotch candy, which in those days we called buttermalt because there was a scotch shortage as the goats ate all the scotch. And just like the color of scotch, the color of our currency was gold, because we were on the gold standard. You know, if you reintroduced the standard, you can bet your bottom @@CURRENCY@@ that the @@CURRENCY@@ will be worth something again."

4. "The United Federation is trying to undermine @@NAME@@ and the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ way of life!" opines hyper-patriotic news personality Ásmunda O'Hara, who is coincidentally talking about this very problem on the TV above the shopkeeper's head. "Treat United Federation Dollars and all other currencies like the pestilence they are — burn them all! And, to stop the menace of foreign currency, the government must suspend all international trade indefinitely — after all, there's no need to exchange currencies if our economy is closed."

The Issue
Official inspectors visiting your nuclear launch silos have revealed that much of the equipment used is decades old, and that sourcing replacement parts for superseded technologies is becoming more difficult.

The Debate
1. "This is an utter disgrace! Imagine how this obsolete trash would perform in the face of nuclear war!" spits General @@RANDOMMALELASTNAME@@, pointing to the red ‘hotline' rotary phone that connects to your office. "We'd all be dead before you can say ‘underfunded military'! You need to remedy this, and get new, state-of-the-art equipment and computers, with the latest versions of the best software on the market. Our nation's safety depends on it!"

2. "It's not just a matter of cost," complains your Treasury Minister, as @@HE@@ turns down the silo's thermostat to reduce the heating bill. "An upgrade of this scale would cost us more than yuns! It would mean abandoning tried and tested approaches, which we know are reliable and safe from hackers. And cheap. But mostly reliable and safe. I mean, we could still use this stuff, can't we? Just buy any spare parts you need cheap from vBay or something. This isn't about money! It isn't!"

3. "Woah, dude, WMDs are like, so uncool," wails Private @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, a hippie peacenik who accidentally enlisted while high, but has stuck around for the free food. "Why spend money on weapons of war, when you can spend it on, like... other stuff, man! You gotta make love, not war, guys." He absent-mindedly offers you a toke from his spliff.

The Issue
Thanks to a timely mastectomy performed by the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ health care system, your trusted aide Kira Ripoli has survived cancer and received a clean bill of health. In preparing to return to work, however, she has been caught flat-footed.

The Debate
1. "How can I face the world without constantly reminding people that my eyes are up here?" asks Ripoli. "In order for both my mental and physical health to be restored, I must have access to reconstructive surgery! I mean, my breasts were small and humble, and hardly mountainous, but they were mine, you know? The hospitals took me apart — they can darn well put me back together!"

2. "This case seems clear-cut to me," agrees ambitious anesthesiologist @@RANDOMNAME@@. "But it's not enough to restore what illness has taken. We have the technology to remove wrinkles from the elderly, shave weight off the obese, even adjust the corneas of people who keep forgetting their glasses! Our hospitals must treat every case of cosmetic surgery, so our population can look and feel their best."

3. "I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller," bemoans the uncoordinated @@RANDOMNAME@@. "But you know what? I don't ask the public to pay for height augmentation. @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ health care should only be used for urgent medical conditions, not elective surgeries. If Kira doesn't like the way she looks, she could have just paid for her own boob job."

[b][anchor=1415]#1415[/anchor]: The Melting Point [Westinor; ed: Noahs Second Country][/b]

The Issue
The thousand-year-old @@ANIMAL@@foot Glacier, located in northern @@NAME@@, served as a natural dam for the @@ANIMAL@@ Lake. Yesterday it broke open, causing the lake's contents to rush out into the valley below, destroying the downstream ecosystem and a nearby town.

The Debate
1. "This disaster is just another example of how human-accelerated climate change is destroying the natural world!" exclaims environmental activist Amadeus Smit, slowly heating up in anger. "Cars, factories, and excessive flatulence cause glaciers like the @@ANIMAL@@foot to melt prematurely! Soon, these beauties will be all but gone. @@LEADER@@, you have to do something — speeches, environmental regulations, anything to stop the rising temperatures! Every person in @@NAME@@ has to know the consequences of their carelessness!"

2. "Oh get out of here you whining hippy!" grumbles Emily Black as she pushes her way into the room. "My town was flooded and my swimming pool was destroyed in this disaster. People may go homeless for who knows how long! Violet's sake, your first priority should be to us, the average @@DEMONYM@@, not some nonsense tree-loving wacko! Ensure that our tax @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ are going right back towards rebuilding affected homes and businesses."

*3. "It's your own fault that you built a town smack-dab in the center of a potential flood pathway," sighs self-described "preventionist" Joseph Haggard as he emerges from the floor in mining gear. "Everyone knows that areas within a seventeen-mile proximity of a glacier are in danger of flooding. Really, most of @@NAME@@ is vulnerable to some watery hazard, like the giant waterfall only a few miles from @@CAPITAL@@! Why don't we go ahead and move all the water out of the way with dams and drainage channels across the nation? I've taken the liberty of preparing a map listing potential areas in danger." He shows you a map with an uncountable number of marks on it. "See here, here, here and here..." [[color=blue]Dam projects allowed[/color]]

*4. "It's your own fault that you built a town smack-dab in the center of a potential flood pathway," sighs self-described "preventionist" Michonne Erso as she emerges from the floor in mining gear. "Since we don't allow dams in this nation, all areas within a seventeen-mile proximity of a glacier are in danger of flooding! Really, most of @@NAME@@ is vulnerable to some watery hazard, like the giant waterfall only a few miles from @@CAPITAL@@. Let's build dikes, dams, and drainage channels until all of the water is safely contained behind our man-made barriers. I've taken the liberty of preparing a map for you." She shows you a map with an uncountable number of marks on it. "See here, here, here and here..." [[color=red]Dam projects banned[/color]]

[b][anchor=1416]#1416[/anchor]: Building on Sand [Fauxia; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
Intelligence reports confirm that the ever-ambitious nation of Wezeltonia has been constructing artificial islands in the Maxxi Sea, in order to claim jurisdiction over the adjacent waters.

The Debate
1. "Those thieves think they can shut us out!" yells trade advisor @@RANDOMNAME@@, placing a small ball on one side of a brass balance. "Trillions of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ pass through the Maxxi Sea. If we let Wezeltonia establish sovereignty there, they'll be strong enough economically to bring the rest of the world to its knees! We need to get Brancaland, Skandilund, heck, maybe even Blackacre, to sanction Wezeltonia until they cease this naked mercantilism!" @@HE@@ drops a large weight onto the other side of the scale, causing the ball to fly and hit your young intern in the head.

2. "What business of yours is it if we develop our own waters?" snaps @@RANDOMNAME@@, the ill-tempered ambassador from Wezeltonia. "We don't tell you how to manage your outlying territories, unless your outlying territories lie in our zone of control. But I'll tell you what, maybe we could contract with some of your construction firms to help us build. That could put both our nations on a more solid foundation."

3. "Wezeltonia is destroying the environment in the Maxxi Sea!" wails marine biologist @@RANDOMNAME@@, who was not invited to this meeting but followed your carbon footprint here. "All that sand is destroying coral reefs and killing sea creatures in their own habitat. We need to convince the World Assembly to declare that artificial islands are not recognized as territory, to reduce Wezeltonia's economic incentive to build there. If that doesn't work, send them a telegram and order them to stop murdering harmless fish, crustaceans, and vampire squids!"

4. "It seems to me that these shores do still be international waters, savvy?" says Admiral @@RANDOMNAME@@, looking through the wrong end of a spyglass. "Let's send a ship or two out there to remind Wezeltonia that our freedom of navigation still applies. With our patrols on the watch, they won't dare venture more than a few nautical miles from their shore! Or kilometers or other such bilge."

[b][anchor=1417]#1417[/anchor]: Nun on the Run [Sacara; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The Sisters of Saint Katherine's Mercy are a religious order known for their charitable works and advocacy for the poor. Although their philanthropy often relies upon unorthodox fundraising methods, it was still surprising when Sister Deloris @@RANDOMLASTNAMEFEMALE@@ recently announced her intention to run for a vacant parliament seat.

The Debate
1. "There must be a separation of church and state," declares your militantly atheist cousin. "She will obviously use her religious position to gain votes and attempt to interfere with our government. Even worse, she's running as an independent candidate in one of the most vulnerable districts for our party. If you wish to maintain credibility within the halls of parliament, you cannot allow anyone in a position like this to gain office!"

2. "Citizens should be able to serve both our nation and our Creator," asserts Sister Deloris, wearing a pin that reads ‘greed is a sin'. "And the best way to serve the neediest people of our nation is to be in the same room where all of our tax funds are distributed, advocating on behalf of the people who don't currently have a voice in these decisions. All I want to do is make @@NAME@@ a better place. If you claim to be democratic, my religious beliefs shouldn't prevent me from running."

3. "I don't see why any job should be allowed to discriminate based on religious affiliation," argues Sister Angela Night of the Order of Divine Retribution, brandishing a loop of prayer beads set with metal spikes. "For example, I applied to join the police, but they said that my religious background wasn't suitable for police work. If anything, I'd think it makes me more motivated to deliver a righteous beatdown to the lawbreakers and sinners that still walk around our streets with impunity. It's not just a job for me — it's a daily vocation."

4. "Perhaps we need to get our nation back onto the right track by mandating that all of our elected leaders are believers," ponders your Minister of Sacramental Supremacy, in between bouts of chanting and hitting himself in the forehead with a board. "The root of all evil comes from the lack of faith in a creator, so it only makes sense that those who govern us believe in one. @@LEADER@@, you must ensure that those running for political office have at least some sort of religious beliefs."

[b][anchor=1418]#1418[/anchor]: The High Life [USS Monitor; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Returning from a business trip yesterday, your cousin had to rush his two-year-old son to the hospital. Apparently, the child's mother had been too doped up to feed the child while he was gone. Your aides say incidents like this are on the rise due to high levels of drug consumption.

The Debate
1. "Hey, raising kids is a lot of work, and you can't blame people if they have a hard time keeping up," says one of your laziest aides. "We just need more social services and government-funded day care to make sure families have the support they need. Can you pass me another doughnut? I've got the munchies."

2. "Oh, please! It's not that hard!" says anxious parent @@RANDOMNAME@@, affectionately ruffling @@HIS@@ son's hair and popping a little yellow pill to calm her nerves. "Parents just need some training, and need to pick the right uppers to help them through their busy day. Promote and subsidise the production of drugs that stimulate increased activity and energy, and no kid will ever be neglected. Right? Right? Right? Right?"

3. "Dude, if you take more of those, you will get an overdose," says local drug dealer @@RANDOMNAME@@, who came to your office hoping to sell you some of @@HIS@@ best quality weed. "If @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ are so bad at raising kids, then maybe we should just stop doing it. Turn the kids loose in the wild and let them take care of themselves. They'll probably do a better job than we do anyway."

4. "Is that MARIJUANA?" bellows your chief of security, who has suddenly awakened from a stupor and is now desperately trying to look alert and productive. "Since when do we allow DRUGS in government offices? Arrest that low-life! It's time to clean up the streets! Merge the @@CAPITAL@@ Police into my department and I'll have the city cleaned up in no time!"

[b][anchor=1419]#1419[/anchor]: The Madson-Hashley Scandal [Electrum; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A vigilante group has acquired and published the membership rolls of the Madson-Hashley Club, a secret group for those wanting to commit the illegal act of adultery. With a few high-profile suicides stemming from the leak, experts are concerned that prosecuting these adulterers will do more harm than good.

The Debate
1. "No-one deserves to feel this bad," argues marriage counsellor Arnie Unterobernegger, a former politician and actor renowned for his love of eating out. "Think about the people who are going to be publicly shamed, having had their relationship put on trial. The whole process is shameful, and has already driven people over the edge. You should legalise adultery, and let the relationships of consenting adults be kept between them and their marriage counsellors."

2. A lady twisting her husband by the ear comes over. "Adultery is the ultimate betrayal and should always remain illegal. However, if I can find it within myself to forgive my spouse, then what's the point of charging him with a crime? As the offended party, I should get to determine his... punishment. You've learned your lesson, haven't you, darling?" Her husband nods slightly before she lets his ear go.

3. "Your husband's taken you for a fool," snaps @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, a stiff-necked staffer who has been cheated on by three different partners. "We should not be merciful to a sophisticated network intent on breaking our adultery laws. You must set up an anti-adultery task force to uncover and expose all the filthy cheaters in this nation! We must not stop until all their lives are destroyed. As for the people behind Madson-Hashley, they're more than accomplices — they're an organised crime syndicate, who should be treated as such."

4. "No-one is disputing that the adulterers broke the law, but these vigilantes have also callously destroyed the lives of many innocent partners who must live with the public shame of their spouse's infidelity," observes Ed Indy Sand, a privacy advocate. "They should have handed this information over privately to law enforcement, rather than raising a hullabaloo, airing all this dirty laundry in public. The vigilantes should be prosecuted for causing deliberate emotional and psychological harm."
