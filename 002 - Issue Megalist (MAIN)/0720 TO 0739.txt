[b][anchor=720]#720[/anchor]: Cui Bono? [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
Conservative media news source [i]Brightheart[/i]'s recent exposé claiming that 25% of domestic terrorist funding comes from welfare fraud has sparked an earnest debate across @@NAME@@ on welfare reform.

The Debate
1. "It was bad enough that criminals and lazy bums were scrounging from the state, but now the government is directly subsidising terrorism!" yells [i]Brightheart News[/i] reporter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pursuing you down the street and trampling over a homeless man's sleeping bag to keep up. "You have to end the free ride! Cut welfare completely, and make our nation safe!"

2. "Hold your horses there buddy, let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater," says single parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, ignoring the three mewling moppets trying to get @HIS@@ attention. "@@NAME@@ just needs its welfare system to be fully managed, monitored, and policed. Give folks on welfare charge cards whose transactions records are sent to a searchable police database. Then anyone making a purchase that's the least bit suspicious should be brought in for interrogation."

*3. "Sounds like a lot of expensive admin work to me," complains Welfare Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Wouldn't you rather have a solution that reduces government spending but still helps those who deserve it? Here's the thing, nobody wants to say it, but we all know that 99% of terrorists are from a handful of religions and nations. Just say that people from those groups don't get welfare, and you can both save money and prevent terrorism!" [[color=purple]Must not have Atheism[/color]]

*4. “Sounds like a lot of expensive admin work to me,” complains Welfare Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@. “Wouldn’t you rather have a solution that reduces government spending but still helps those who deserve it? Here’s the thing, nobody wants to say it, but we all know that 99% of terrorists are from a handful of cultures. Just say that people from those groups don’t get welfare, and you can both save money and prevent terrorism!” [[color=purple]Must have Atheism[/color]]

5. "I say unto to you that the answer is more welfare, not less!" offers unemployed youth @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Violetsglory, pushing a shopping trolley of ammonium nitrate and diesel oil to the checkout till. "If you increase welfare, then maybe the resentful disenfranchised minorities will feel more supported by society, and become less prone to radicalisation. What have you got to lose?"

[b][anchor=721]#721[/anchor]: A Lack Of Comma Sense [A Humanist Science; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
After your highest-ranking legislative aide dedicated her new memoir to 'my parents, @@LEADER@@ and Maxx', unreputable news sources, the [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Gazette[/i] and [i]the @@NAME@@ Times[/i] have been harassing your office incessantly about nepotism in your administration. An assortment of advisers have met with you over some bamboo soup to discuss this serial issue.

The Debate
1. "The serial comma avoids ambiguous meanings," says ghostwriter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while picking the bay leaves from among the shoots. "Had there been a comma after '@@LEADER@@' but before 'and,' the intended meaning of the sentence would have been obvious. Hopefully, you can see why our government needs to create and maintain a mandatory style guide. The point being is that this initiative should be funded right away! After all, it's best to write safe." 

2. "The serial comma can just as easily add ambiguous meaning, and just takes up space unnecessarily," replies photographer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as he tries to shoot the leaves before he eats. "Don't you find its usage to be not correct? And are you ready to convince the taxpayer of the extra expense they will be taking on? Because that's what you will have to do." 

3. Your Pear Phone suddenly starts vibrating as you receive the following text: [i]imho we dont ned ne govt stile gide or grmmer or cursvie... mind ur own busnss... we type how we type... mabe the govt shud lern our way... idk idc whatevs ttyl[/i]

4. "Punctuation is but a way for the elites to once again restrain the exchange of free ideas," begins noted windba— "in order to further hold down oppress and smother and stamp out the honest working men and women of this country into a state of utter and complete impotence," he continues, "so that the entitled and ruthless would be leaders of this world could sit in their castles built on the backs and labor of the commoner," he continues further, "and smugly judge and spit on them in distain but to that I say no we shall not take on your shackles and chains of punctuation as we will not be bullied into constrained or controlled or ignoble speech..." showing no sign of stopping, he is gently nudged out the door by your guards and — surprising no one — continues as he leaves.

[b][anchor=722]#722[/anchor]: Thora And Eloise [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The cross-country crime-spree of two women, Thora Dobbs and Eloise Mulholland, kept the nation hooked to their TV sets for several days, and ended in tragedy with their joint suicide pact. The unfolding story has given the pair a strange anti-hero celebrity status, with many tearful and sighing fans laying flower wreaths and shell-casings around the burnt out wreck of their car. The press are awaiting a statement from your office on the matter.

The Debate
1. "It's clear," says @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, of popular feminist panel-show [i]HERstory[/i], "that Ms. Dobbs and Ms. Mulholland were making a protest against the phallocentric values that dictate our outdated laws." She waves her hands for applause, momentarily forgetting that she's not in the television studio. "Uh... We should applaud them."

2. "But this isn't daubing some graffito," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the so-called [i]Hanging Judge of @@CAPITAL@@[/i]. "These gals weren't Robin Hood. They robbed seventeen convenience stores, shot three people, and stole clothes from my Mama's washing line. Let's call a spade a spade, here: they're evil. They deserved to plunge off the @@ANIMAL@@ Viaduct."

3. "Let's be honest," mansplains @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, the proudly chauvinistic author of [i]Men are Divine, Women are Slime[/i], as he pushes in front of the previous two speakers, "this all began the moment those young ladies got in that car. Had two unchaperoned girls been kept from doing that, this mess would never have happened. Well, there's only one sane, logical answer to that... Don't let womenfolk drive anymore."

[b][anchor=723]#723[/anchor]: To Know Sacrifice [Rubyna; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
After many officials replied, "What? Where's that? Who cares?" when they were told where they had in fact sent hundreds of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ soldiers a few days beforehand, the government is being petitioned to require that all politicians have a military background.

The Debate
1. "This is outrageous!" cries a distraught @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ soldier, almost falling to the ground under the weight of her equipment. "They don't know the reality of war because they themselves have never been a part of it. If all politicians had served in the military, they would know what they were getting us into and would think twice before sending us into conflict. I'd like to see the Finance Minister do a thousand push-ups!"

2. "You want us to do what now?" splutters one of your senior Ministers, spilling her tea everywhere. "These people don't know all the work we already do, all the things we have already sacrificed. Should I remind you we had to carve our own paths and make something of ourselves before we could even think of getting involved with politics? These ruffians obviously need to be put in their place; a cut to the military budget would do nicely!"

3. "There is another option," claims your secretary, sneakily rising from behind your desk. "We needn't send any of your colleagues into battle, but it isn't necessary to defy public opinion. Let them have their service - just make it short and easy! Each politician could have a nice clean service record, for no effort at all. Perhaps it could be used as an excuse for a holiday..."

[b][anchor=724]#724[/anchor]: Your Stuff is Forfeit [Sierra Lyricalia; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
Property rights advocates and drug law reformers are up in arms this week. In the largest criminal asset forfeiture in @@NAME@@'s history, the immense mansion of prominent citizen Alvin Woofsdale was seized after his nephew was arrested for dealing drugs. With the property already at auction and the legislature twiddling its thumbs as usual, your chief of staff invited the loudest voices into your office to vent their opinions on the matter.

The Debate
1. "Forfeiture is a barbaric, medieval practice whose time has come," grumbles Woofsdale as he compulsively rubs his nose. "I had no idea what that little scamp was doing; heck, I wasn't even in the country at the time! Yet the police can seize and sell off my whole house without even charging me with a crime, let alone convicting me! And ordinary folks are even worse off when it happens to them, who's gonna help them get their homes back? It's simply time to stop, if we believe in freedom, we must outlaw forfeiture!"

2. "If cops take a little money from drug dealers and their associates, I ain't seeing no problems with it," bluntly states the trench coat clad Kumar Small, who has a prominent scar on his face. "I may have even made a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ myself doing something similar. All in the game, right? Y'all oughta make it easier for cops to take drug dealers stuff, that way police will be able to keep policing and drug dealers won't be able to afford to stay in business, all on the cheap for tax payers."

*3. "Shoooooooot!" exclaims Mud Davidson, the Member of Parliament representing the district were the incident took place. @@HE@@ also happens to have successfully defended himself from four separate allegations of ethics violations. "We can't afford to drop asset forfeiture, especially with tax receipts so low this year. But the police have too much incentive to use forfeiture, there needs to be oversight. I would like to head a new Investigatory and Oversight Committee that would make sure the forfeiture does what its supposed to do and the government get its cheques... uh, keep this in check." [[color=blue]Must have elections[/color]]

*4. "Shoooooooot!" exclaims Mud Davidson, a high ranking government official, who is rumored to have a lifestyle suspiciously more luxurious than would be expected for his income. "We can't afford to drop asset forfeiture, especially with tax receipts so low this year. But the police have too much incentive to use forfeiture, there needs to be oversight. I would like to head an independent Oversight Committee that would make sure the forfeiture does what its supposed to do and the government gets its cheques... uh, keep this in check."

[b][anchor=725]#725[/anchor]: Sky's The Limit? [Le Libertia; ed: Wyethalania][/b]

The Issue
Chaos erupted in the capital this weekend when thousands flocked to the city center in hopes of acquiring one of the few recently available apartment spaces in all of @@CAPITAL@@. Fighting quickly ensued, sending hundreds to the hospital. Afterwards, footage emerged of you watching the all-out brawl from your office window while eating popcorn. With public outcry mounting, you furtively lick your buttery fingers clean and wonder how to best handle this housing situation.

The Debate
1. An architect, who coincidentally also built your office, suddenly leaps into the room from a hidden passageway you never knew existed. "@@LEADER@@, there's a simple solution to this conundrum: abolish any and all height restrictions on our buildings. Just picture it, apartment complexes hundred of stories tall with radio antennae that bedeck the sky in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ architectural glory. Chip in a few extra @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@, and we can even make some floating palaces while we're at it!"

2. "Why go up when you can go down?" posits miner @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ 'Mole' Molière after digging up through your floorboards. "Just put us pitmen and hauliers to the task, and we can dig out a fully-functional, subterranean wonderland in no time at all. Not to mention, we'll no longer have to fear aerial attacks or sunburns again! If naysayers and dissidents don't like being made to live underground, just lock the access tunnels and the problem solves itself."

*3. "What's all this nonsense I hear from afar?" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Historical Reenactments, while charging into to the room upon his armored steed. He plants a flag upon your desk and proclaims, "My territory now! Anyway, the really obvious solution to your problem is to eliminate housing deeds and rental agreements in @@CAPITAL@@. Simply take what abode pleases you... and if any pesky 'owner' stands in your way, fight them like how our warring and wayfaring ancestors of old did." He then rips up a copy of the city's bylaws and scoffs, "Who cares about all this legal mumbo-jumbo anyway?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "What's all this nonsense I hear from afar?" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Urban Development and Intelligence Gathering, while discretely removing a listening device from beneath the architect's lapel. "The really obvious solution to your problem, and mine by the way, is to make housing dependent on citizens' talkativeness to the state. For example, they tell us what those nogoodniks in Apartment C7-100 are up to, and boom, they're moved right into Palace 1A. Refuse, we throw them out on the streets. All for the state, and the state for all." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

[b][anchor=726]#726[/anchor]: Jobless Fair [Rezler; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
After a much-touted job fair in @@CAPITAL@@ resulted in only two hires, the discouraged and desperate unemployed are calling for the government to step in and make job fairs more effective.

The Debate
1. "This can't go on!" wails one forlorn job-seeker, wearing a t-shirt with @@HIS@@ entire resume printed on it. "I've been to twenty-three job fairs and I haven't gotten a single interview! There's too much hiring through back-channel networks, like being hired just for happening to be the CEO's cousin. Companies should be placed under a mandate to blind hire only through career fairs, with government oversight to ensure that only the most qualified applicants are being hired."

2. "Yeah, regulations always help businesses grow," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Widgets Inc, @@HIS@@ voice ripe with sarcasm. "If you want businesses to hire more people at job fairs, the government needs to relax regulations surrounding hiring and firing employees. And how about a few thousand @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ tax break for each job applicant companies hire at the fairs? I promise, it'll jump start the economy and pay for itself."

*3. "The problem is there's no one in @@NAME@@ who is actually qualified to fill the jobs I need," sighs Anita Jobs, CEO of the major tech company Pear. "Can you please drop this silly immigration ban already? Once tech companies like Pear reboot the economy, I'm sure these hapless job fair attendees will be able to get jobs at McRonald's or something." [[color=red]Immigration is illegal[/color], [color=purple]Must ban Autarky[/color], TBC]

*4. "The problem is there's no one in @@NAME@@ who is actually qualified to fill the jobs I need," sighs Anita Jobs, CEO of the major tech company Pear. "Can you please make it easier for us to hire high-skilled labor from outside the country? Once tech companies like Pear reboot the economy, I'm sure these hapless job fair attendees will be able to get jobs at McRonald's or something." [[color=blue]Immigration is legal[/color], [color=purple]Must not ban Autarky[/color], TBC]

5. "It is obvious relying on the private sector to create jobs has failed!" wails your top Employment Minister, who also happens to be your cousin. "A well-planned state economy would fix all of this. Just think of the efficiency of it, we could simply assign people jobs, and imagine the comfort @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ would have if they knew they were assured a job before they even finished school? We could even tailor people's education to improve their productivity at their future careers!"

[b][anchor=727]#727[/anchor]: Market Crash [North Isseggggnignigsegigisegggg Islands; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
On a busy Saturday morning, a minicab driver took a shortcut through a crowded market street. After skidding on some banana peels, he lost control and crashed through a dozen fruit and vegetable stalls, narrowly avoiding injuring anyone. Pedestrians are donning full body armor, and @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are beginning to accept that reckless driving and speeding in the inner city may be just another fact of life.

The Debate
1. "The roads themselves are letting drivers get away with high speeds," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a market stall holder, wiping pulped tomato from @HIS@@ face. "We need traffic calming measures on our city streets: chicanes, speed-bumps, curb extensions, median diverters, and speed cameras. Slow down to save lives!"

2. "That makes as much sense as putting a spike on steering wheels to get people to drive more carefully!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a junior town planner, heaving a hefty box of documents onto your desk. "According to these studies, by the Ministry of Transport itself, so-called 'traffic calming' measures actually increase accidents. Instead, we need to allow high speeds to be safe: that is, remove blind spots, and rebuild the city to allow for wide straight roads. It's the evidence-based approach."

3. "Hmm... actually, can we think more on that steering wheel spike thing?" asks a familiar-looking cyclist with an irate expression, deliberately bashing your shins with his crutches. "You should make it so that all cars must have this, and you'll end up with more careful motorists, whether it's by operant conditioning or by natural selection. Now that's what I call science!"

4. "Why don't you just pedestrianise a big chunk of the city centre?" suggests tourist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, adjusting @@HIS@@ anti-smog facemask. "It'll make the whole area much prettier, quieter and cleaner, and it'll let you show off the beauty of the heart of the city."

5. "Or better still, why don't you just take your hands off the steering wheel, and let folk drive as we please?" asks impatient commuter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wiping a suspicious red-brown stain off @@HIS@@ front fender. "Typical nanny state, trying to tell ME how to drive! Get out of the way, government!"

[b][anchor=728]#728[/anchor]: A Bone To Pick [Sunset Sea Islands; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Acclaimed yet controversial thespian @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ elicited shock (and not coincidentally, more than a little publicity) after performing Hamlet with the severed head of his recently deceased uncle taking the role of 'Yorick' in lieu of the usual fake skull. A debate has begun over proper respect for human remains, and whether the general public should be allowed to own them.

The Debate
1. "DAH-ling, when I play the Oedipal Prince I want your rapt attention!" explains the pretentious actor, shaking his uncle's left femur at you for emphasis. "Did not the jester's head held aloft in my hand both capture and captivate your gaze? Was I not momentarily a solitary tableau vivant to behold and admire? A replica would have lacked authenticity, and the Art demands authenticity! Owning human bones should be perfectly legal for all, as should gathering any unclaimed remains. My wondrous panoply of accoutrements is not complete without these fragments of mortality!"

2. "I agree that owning cadavers should be legal, but it should be restricted solely to members of the medical and scientific community with stringent regulations to establish proper consent and to safeguard the proper use of the remains," recommends @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a medical student and keen anatomist. "Human specimens are needed by archaeologists, doctors, transplant surgeons, researchers and the like. Letting a liver rot underground is just a waste."

*3. "What you people are failing to see is the enormous market gap!" giddily giggles entrepreneur @@RANDOM_NAME@@, gesturing and gesticulating at a nearby graveyard. "There's a fortune of bits here in buried treasure! Let people pre-sell their future remains to forward-thinking companies, or let relatives do the same with the recently deceased, and we can turn cold stiff bodies into cold hard cash! Everybody with any body wins! The bereaved can dry their tears with banknotes, while we make accessories from real human ivory, and handbags from the finest human leather! Hmm... @@LEADER@@, has anyone ever told you what lovely skin you have?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "What you people are failing to see is the enormous social resource," mentions morbid mortician @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in a monotone. "Bones can be turned to human ivory, skin can be tanned into good leather, and trace elements reclaimed for state industry. Indeed, it should be seen as every citizen's final duty to go into the recycling processing centre, and become one with the People's economy!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

*5. "HERESY!" screams Really Revered Reverend @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who claims to be an ordained cleric of a religion you've never heard of. "Have all of you lost your minds? Do you understand what you are saying? When people die, they must be respectfully buried whole, otherwise in the afterlife they will be fragmented! Would you like to spend all eternity as a pile of loose body parts? I'm sure I wouldn't! Do you want the restless shades of the dismembered haunting you? I'm sure I don't! The dead must be allowed rest in peace, not pieces!" [[color=purple]Must not ban religion[/color]]

*6. "What about DIGNITY?" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who claims to represent a 'silent majority' you've never heard of. "Have all of you lost your minds? Do you understand what you are saying? When people die, they must be respectfully buried whole, not used for profit or some kind of nefarious experiment! Would you like to spend all eternity as a pile of loose body parts? I'm sure I wouldn't, and neither does anybody else. The dead must be allowed rest in peace, not pieces!" [[color=purple]Must ban religion[/color]]

[b][anchor=729]#729[/anchor]: Teenage Kicks [Abhichandra; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Dozens of children were seriously injured last week, during [i]Kick a Ginger Day[/i], the traditional start-of-term ritual in which generations of redheaded children at [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Lake Secondary School[/i] have been attacked by their classmates. The Principal says their staff, notably devoid of redheads, were out to lunch and heard nothing of the rampage. Sensing a photo-op, you have cancelled your Step-Yoga class and headed over to the school to meet the parents.

The Debate
1. "THIS IS BULLYING!" yells civil-rights activist and parent of redheaded twins, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, showing you a photograph of @@HIS@@ children in hospital beds. "It is unconscionable for me to even think that my poor daughters were beaten for something they can't control! All children should be treated equally, regardless of their hair color. What if it was 'Bash a Blonde Day'? Would that be okay? I say we must take a hard line on all forms of bullying in our schools, and wipe it out: teasing, joking, badinage, poking fun, mockery, harrying, pestering..."

2. "Bullying? Please! Now what are those liberal ninnies whining about?" scoffs @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Harker, whose brown-haired son, Paxton, participated in the ritual kicking. "They were foot nudges, uncomfortable for a minute. Two, maybe. Not harmful at all. This is really the erosion of our traditions by the left-wing elite, the suppression of childish high spirits by folks who'd see them become tax-payin' tree-huggin' robots. Why, we did it all the time when I was a kid. At the end, all the normal kids give those weird gingers a hearty thump on the back, accepting 'em as good sports. And they like that. Keep the nanny state out of the playground, and respect our ancient traditions."

*3. "Rubbish!" snorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@ an avid @@ANIMAL@@ball fan, who is watching the televised play-offs on @@HIS@@ [i]Pear Phone Grande[/i] and has barely looked at @@HIS@@ daughter since she arrived. "Getting kids to be nice, allowing kids to beat each other up. What kids [i]really[/i] need is daily contact sports to work off that energy. Once you thrash your opponent on the field, thrashing them with your fist seems kind of pointless. And, there's another upside. Little Tammy Thompson won't have the strength to beat-up anyone if she's spent all day kicking a ball." [[color=blue]Computers are legal[/color]]

*4. "Rubbish!" snorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an avid amateur @@ANIMAL@@ball fan, who busily plucks lint from @@HIS@@ West @@CAPITAL@@ Wanderers sweatshirt and has barely glanced at @@HIS@@ daughter. "Getting kids to be nice, allowing kids to beat each other up. What kids really need is daily contact sports to work off that energy. Once you thrash your opponent on the field, thrashing them with your fist seems kind of pointless. And, there's another upside. Little Tammy Thompson won't have the strength to beat-up anyone if she's spent all day kicking a ball." [[color=red]Computers are illegal[/color]]

5. "The obvious solution has been overlooked," states another parent, programmer @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ 'Chips' Wei, who has spent his whole life trying to blend in. "Simply dye everyone's hair the same colour when they start school. You don't know what it's like, @@LEADER@@. The beating of the drums would start, and then the remorseless chanting, and all the teachers would lock themselves in the staffroom until it was over. To protect children from their playmates' scorn and savagery, uniformity is the only way." Paxton Harker's parent trips him up, and a group of brunette parents guffaw.

[b][anchor=730]#730[/anchor]: It's Legal Now! [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
It's been high times all around since the government legalized recreational marijuana. While adults can no longer be prosecuted for using or selling the drug, there still remains a high number of drug offenders in @@NAME@@'s prisons who were sentenced before the law changed.

The Debate
1. "Clogging @@NAME@@'s prisons with people who were simply ahead of their time is cruel, illogical and inhumane!" opines advocate @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while puffing Maxtopian Grass cigar smoke into your face. "These visionaries should never have been imprisoned in the first place and the government needs to release every single one of them. You'd free up thousands of jail cells, and it sure beats turning them into hardened criminals behind bars."

2. "I sympathize with their situation, but as the old saying goes: 'do the crime and do the time'," reminds by-the-book @@TYPEINITIALS@@@@NAME_INITIALS@@ Drug Enforcement Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Drug possession may be legal now, but it wasn't when these people were arrested. They knowingly broke the law, and when you break the law in Heliosphere, you go to jail. Letting them out sends the wrong message."

3. "Drugs are bad, m'kay," preaches anti-drug advocate and oddly-shaped high school guidance counselor @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ McKay. "We should never have legalized the stuff in the first place. Drugs like Maxtopian Grass cause health problems and our children are still getting their hands on it, m'kay. We need to recriminalize all recreational drugs and keep the druggies off the streets. Throw the stuff away and be done with it, m'kay."

[b][anchor=731]#731[/anchor]: Is There An Election In Marche Noire Or Are You Just Happy To See Us? [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Wyethalania][/b]

The Issue
Facing a tight political race at home, Otto Kratt, the authoritarian leader of Marche Noire, and his cronies plan to clinch his fourth reelection by campaigning for the votes of Marche Noirian emigrants in @@NAME@@. Alarmed and angered by his many flagrant violations of human rights, socially-conscious protestors have demanded that you forbid him from propagating his vitriolic views on @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ soil in order to hamper his chances of victory.

The Debate
1. "This is a travesty!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Marche Noirian asylee and head organizer for the Freedom for Oppressed Peoples' Initiative. "Mr. Kratt cruelly subjugates our people and maintains power in Marche Noire by sowing seeds of hatred between its various ethnic groups. This is our chance to peaceably remove him. Please, do not allow him to use @@NAME@@ as a podium to tighten his stranglehold on our people. @@LEADER@@, to show our solidarity for Marche Noirians and oppressed peoples everywhere, we must ban Otto Kratt and every other tin-pot dictator from coming to our country immediately!"

2. "Putrid lies!" howls @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a supportive Marche Noirian immigrant carrying a life-size cardboard cutout of Otto Kratt. "We love Otto Kratt! He is the most wonderful and glorious leader of Marche Noire who cares deeply for us when he chooses. He has every right to talk to his kinsmen wherever they are! You keep saying that people here have freedom of speech, yet you would deprive our ruler of his freedom to speak to us now? Leader, you must allow Mr. Kratt to campaign and organize rallies here."

3. "Maybe, this can be a win-win for everyone," ponders Solomon @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, your Minister of Twofold Solutions, while running his fingers through his hair. "Obviously, this dictator only wants to campaign here for his expats' votes, but he wouldn't come if they didn't exist... Just abolish dual citizenship. Our Marche Noirian immigrants can either decide to become fully-fledged @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ or be deported back to Marche Noire. This way, we'll keep the ones truly devoted to our way of life and Otto Kratt will get the votes he so desperately wants. Two birds, one stone!"

[b][anchor=732]#732[/anchor]: A Peeping Problem [Drasnia; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
Several of your aides were fired yesterday after the IT Department found pornography on their work computers. The former employees have fought back saying their privacy was violated and they should be restored to their positions.

The Debate
1. "Thank you so much for meeting with us, @@LEADER@@!" greets @@RANDOM_NAMEE@@, one of the aides fired for looking at pornography, while holding out @@HIS@@ hand for a handshake. "Please give us our jobs back! Just because I'm lonelier than most shouldn't be a reason to fire me. Look at my past performance reviews, I was a great worker who always got everything done ahead of schedule. Even if the computers are technically theirs, letting employers look into an employee's browsing history is a creepy invasion of privacy anyway, the practice should be outlawed regardless."

2. Your IT technician peers over a computer monitor while performing routine maintenance on your computer: "Are these people nuts? If people want to watch pornography they should do so in the privacy of their own homes, not on employers' computers. These employees violated your trust and therefore deserve to be punished. Your right to privacy ends when you start using your employers' computers."

3. "Let me touch bases with you for some outside of the box thinking," implores workplace coach @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I think giving your workers less detrimental ways to deal with workplace stress could be a real game changer. We need to enable employees to work smarter, not harder. Some low hanging fruit to help resolve this problem could include letting workers set their own hours, adding bean-bag chairs to the office, heck, maybe even mandating slides be put in the break-room. You could even force these things to be implemented across @@NAME@@, as I think they'll work together in synergy to create a real win-win."

The Debate
*1. "@@LEADER@@, we have a brilliant opportunity!" excitedly cheers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the mayor of one of the cities. "Imagine, our city, a front to the world in both summer and winter. All we need to do is develop and deploy a whole fleet of state-of-the-art icebreakers the likes of which the world has never seen before! I can just picture it now: hundreds of ships, thousands of tourists, and millions of pounds worth of goods coming from across the globe to my port... err, @@NAME@@." [[color=blue]Must not have Autarky[/color]]

*2. "@@LEADER@@, we have a brilliant opportunity!" excitedly cheers Francine Meier, the mayor of one of the cities. "Imagine, our city, a front to the world in both summer and winter. All we need to do is develop and deploy a whole fleet of state-of-the-art icebreakers the likes of which the world has never seen before! I can just picture it now: hundreds of ships and thousands of tourists could finally bring millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ from across the globe to my port... err, @@NAME@@." [[color=red]Must have Autarky[/color]]

**3. "Why spend money on expensive icebreakers when good-old fashioned railroads can do the work year round?" questions infamous rail tycoon Cecil Vanderbilt, as his assistant places a model train on your desk. "Invest in my company and ease some health and safety standards, and my men can build and maintain the tracks for a pittance. Full steam ahead! Choo choo!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**4. "Why spend money on expensive icebreakers when good-old fashioned railroads can do the work year round?" questions infamous Transportation Minister Cecil Vanderbilt, as his assistant places a model train on your desk. "Increase my department's funding and ease some health and safety standards, and we can build and maintain the tracks for a pittance. Full steam ahead! Choo choo!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

5. "Why don't we just stockpile before winter?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an advocate of human hibernation. "We bring in everything we need in autumn and don't worry about nothin' in winter. You can help defray the cost of our survival by funding winter fuel allowances and cold weather food supplies for the poorest in the area."

6. "I have ze perfect solution," announces crazed crackpot climatologist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Mein data shows zat ze ice is ziner each passing year due in part to global varming. Now, vhy don't ve just hurry it up by pumping ze atmosphere full of more chlorofluorocarbon? All zis ice will go bye-bye in under a decade! How cool vould zat be?! Vell, not cool, you know... zere'd be no ice."

[b][anchor=734]#734[/anchor]: A Word From Our Sponsors [New Dukaine; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
With its colorful packaging and pleasantly sweet aroma, [i]Health-Squirt Vitamin Juice[/i] has rapidly become one of the most popular drink products in @@NAME@@.  Helping its sales are prime-time TV adverts claiming that it is [i]"a superfood that puts immune-system-boosting natural detox elements and energy-enhancing anti-oxidant vitamins into your cardiovascular system"[/i].  It was recently discovered that the product has no such qualities, and the adverts are clearly lying.

The Debate
1. "False Advertising, Nuisance To Public!" proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, lead journalist for [i]Health Magazine[/i], clearly planning @@HIS/HER@@ next newspaper headline. "But will it ever go away?  In this journo's humble opinion, yes!  Maybe the government should review advertisements to make sure we get THE TRUTH!"

2. "Or you could relax on our beautiful lounge chairs on our charming private beach," suggests marketing rep @@RANDOM_NAME@@, offering you an ice-cool bottle of [i]Health-Squirt[/i], now with [i]Sports Slurp Technology (tm)[/i].  "It's not like we're doing any harm, and promoting the idea of health has got to be of some benefit to those zombified couch potatoes who sit and play [i]@@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ vs Skeletons[/i] all day.  We didn't really do anything wrong, right?  Don't treat people like idiots who don't know what they're buying.  Treat them like idiots who keep the consumer economy going!  Deregulate advertising, and the free market will create wealth for @@NAME@@."

3. A tired-looking and shaggy-haired fellow plops down into your comfiest chair.  "You know what, @@LEADER@@?  I have had enough of ads.  They interrupt my television watching, and we're basically immune to them anyway."  He sips his Eckie-Cola and adjusts his designer sweatband.  "I say we ban all TV advertisements between midday and midnight so we can watch the good stuff on the telly uninterrupted.  Now, can I go back to watching my soap opera?

[b][anchor=735]#735[/anchor]: Rap Sheet [Wallacelavia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Notorious gangster-rapper Wally E was recently taken to court for the suspected murder of a policeman, but was found innocent due to lack of evidence. This surprised many, as one of his more popular raps ([i]"I Killed A Cop And I Liked It"[/i]) contained a complete confession for the shooting within its lyrics.

The Debate
1. "How could we let this happen? I tell you, rap music is just sick minds preaching to a sick audience," spits right-wing demagogue @@RANDOM_NAME@@, free-styling on stage with a microphone in front of a cheering crowd. "There has to be something wrong with you to enjoy its message of anarchistic hate. We're talking about a recorded confession, flaunted in public. Rappers should be held to account for their hateful words, and their filth music should be admissible as court evidence." With that, she drops the mic, and strides off to rapturous applause.

2. "Woah woah woah, I mean... just cos I got, you know, artistic words shouldn't mean you haters should hate me," argues Wally E, reading from a prepared statement. "I mean, like, don't hate freedom of artistic expression, or something? I don't mean everything in my songs literally. We should be free, to like, artistically express. We are artists. Expressing ourselves. So don't hate on me. Yeah."

3. "The problem here is that rap music is terrible trash, enjoyed only by the musical illiterati," observes classical guitarist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, strumming out a complex flamenco ligado. "Shouldn't we pursue a bare minimum of artistic standards in our cultural output? Perhaps the government should create an official Music Standards Bureau to regulate what sort of material gets airplay and exposure. Frankly, we need a better class of music."

[b][anchor=736]#736[/anchor]: A Badly Named Issue [Annihilators of Chan Island; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A few days ago, just before local elections were due to run, a ruffian named Muhammad Lee was imprisoned for grand theft auto. As per policy, this excluded him from the right to vote. However, due to an administrative error, others of the same name - a whole legion of Muhammad Lees across the nation - also found themselves blocked at the polling stations.

The Debate
1. "I have committed no crime save sharing the prisoner's name, but I have been denied my basic democratic rights!" cries Muhammad Lee, a well-respected @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ lobbyist. "We must implement a Voter-ID system based on foolproof measures: passport photos, social security numbers, fingerprints AND iris-identification. Identity confusion cannot be allowed to happen again!"

2. "Don't see what society has got against prisoners anyway," contributes convicted child strangler, hate-crime inciter, and vote fraudster, Muhammad Lee. "How about giving prisoners the right to vote? When it comes down to it, we're all decent human beings, and we deserve to have a say in how society is run."

3. "This whole voting thing really is a pain," says your heavily tattooed cousin, Muhammad Lee. "Just seize power and become dictator of @@NAME@@. You know they will just keep electing you over and over and over again, so why not just formalize it with this final move. Bonus points for the fact that there will be no more issues about names and voting rights."

4. "No need to be that drastic," notes @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@-@@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@-@@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, one of your aides," but it must be noted that 'Muhammad Lee' is a very popular name among certain minorities that don't vote for you. Maybe if you made sure that people with the same name as a criminal couldn't vote, you'd secure a bigger margin of victory next election. Just saying."

[b][anchor=737]#737[/anchor]: Bird-Brained Diplomacy[Ransium; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
Judging from the telegram on your desk this morning, the government of Tasmania is not pleased with your decision to authorize warplanes to patrol the migration of songbirds over its airspace. 

The Debate
1. The telegram reads, "You expect us to believe this is about birds? We reject your ridiculous pretense for violating our airspace. We know you are merely scouting the location of Tasmania's military bases in preparation for all-out war. Remove your forces from Tasmanian airspace today and pay us reparations for this insult, or the troops of Tasmania will be on your shores tomorrow. And you can bet our troops will have @@DEMONYM@@ Breegul in their sack lunch." 

2. "Those Tasmanians think they can boss us around?" crows your Minister of Defense, who is practically drooling over himself with pleasure. "As it so happens, while protecting those precious pigeons... or hummingbirds... oh whatever we said they were... we also incidentally mapped out the location of all the Tasmania military bases. As it also so happens, the patrol aircraft are fully armed with bunker-busting bombs. Just say the word, and we'll begin a strategic air strike and neuter the Tasmanian threat in minutes."

3. "If we must go to war, let's go to war!" cackles The Bird Lady, wearing a giant hawk suit complete with pointed talons. "But not that way. I've trained my flock of birds of prey in the art of war. Say the word, and I'll unleash my deadly and precise raptors on the soldiers of Tasmania. Death from above!"

[b][anchor=738]#738[/anchor]: Cruel Or Unusual? [Leumas Rex; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A small town judge has garnered national attention after sentencing a serial litterer to sit, in lieu of jail time, in a garbage can and hand out apology flyers to locals. Legal experts and concerned citizens have come to offer their unsolicited take on whether or not @@NAME@@ should embrace unorthodox punishments for petty criminals.

The Debate
1. "The government needs to stop telling me how to do my job," states the judge while banging his gavel against your desk. "Sending someone off to the big house merely trains them to be a better criminal! I merely seek to embarrass them or make them do a bit of community service. Like that kid who was spray painting trains; I had him do a mural for the Eastern @@NAME@@ Art Museum, and now he's blossomed into quite the artist. You should encourage us to use our judgement to find fitting, albeit unconventional, punishments for our criminals."

2. "I agree that punishments should be determined on a case-by-case basis, but this is hardly even a slap on the wrist!" grumbles Lexi Talia Onassis, an officer who is currently suspended for using excessive force. "If you want to see crime stop dead in its tracks, you need to enable the police to do to criminals what they have done to others without the hassle of the court system. If someone burns down a house, we burn down theirs! If someone commits murder, we murder them! If someone takes drugs, we... uh..." She trails off. "Anyway, we'll need some more funding for our officers. Things might get messy out there."

3. "Do you think it's wise to put the rehabilitation of our nation's minor offenders in the hands of a judge, or an officer for that matter?" questions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a well-respected advisor in the Justice Department, as @@HE/SHE@@ opens a dozen manilla folders, spilling their contents across your desk. "If we were to open educational rehabilitation clinics in our cities, operated by my Department and overseen by psychological experts, we could design a comprehensive system to stamp out repeat offenses. All it takes is a little funding, but just imagine the informational seminars, four-hour documentaries, even guest speakers from the Retirement Community of Former Felons!"

4. "Do the crime, pay the time," replies a more orthodox judge with a shrug, trudging in after a sixteen-hour hearing. "Everybody wants a creative solution to our crime problem, but all you're doing is putting a burden on our legal professionals. Our primary responsibility is to determine guilt or innocence, and consistent rules for sentencing should be in place for reasons of fairness to the convicted. I suggest we have a fixed-term jail sentence for each crime, regardless of the circumstance. We'll save ourselves a lot of time, and it will eliminate any bias in the severity of punishments."

[b][anchor=739]#739[/anchor]: In Loco Parentis [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
When separated dad @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@ put his daughter @@RANDOMFEMALFIRSTNAME@@ on the train, he made sure her mum knew the correct time and platform at which the child was due to arrive. He also arranged for a babysitter to travel with the tot, given that she was only two years old. Controversially, the babysitter was his son, himself only seven years of age. A train conductor noted both children travelling alone, and intervened by calling the police and social services.

The Debate
1. "The only ****ing problem here is the ****ing train conductor ****ing interfering where he wasn't ****ing wanted," complains @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the mother of the two children, as she thrusts a sippy-cup containing Eckie-Cola at her resisting daughter. "We've been doing it this way for two ****ing years, and never had any ****ing problems. How about the government, the police, social services and all you other nosy ****s keep out of how we choose to deal with OUR ****ing children?"

2. "This is about child safety!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the train conductor. "I mean, we actually have a reasonably priced service where we offer supervision to unattended children. What sort of lousy parent puts a seven-year-old in charge of a two-year-old? Frankly, if parents are too lazy to use the provisions, they shouldn't be allowed to raise kids at all. You should invest in Child Protection Services, and extend their powers to take children into safe, governmental care when they're being neglected by incompetent parents."

3. "If I might interject?" interrupts @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, the seven-year-old boy at the centre of the saga, as he changes his sister's nappy. "Clearly capability varies from child to child, but some of us are obviously more advanced than others. While I accept [i]a priori[/i] that adults are responsible for safeguarding the wellbeing of children, I think there's room for flexibility in the interpretation of adulthood. Posit: Can we institute a formal test, to be applied for at any age, that is legally required to prove capacity to act [i]in loco parentis[/i]? I've been reading up on the legal ins-and-outs, and it seems like a straightforward enough possibility. I'd be happy to help you draft something."
