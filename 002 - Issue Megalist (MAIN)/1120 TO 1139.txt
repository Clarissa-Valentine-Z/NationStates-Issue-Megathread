[b][anchor=1120]#1120[/anchor]: Following Yonder Star [Bears Armed; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The rulers of three distant kingdoms have all requested permission to enter @@NAME@@ and visit the small town of Betraisa during a specific week this year. When asked for an explanation, they each disclosed that a keen interest in astrology had led them to believe that a long-prophesied religious teacher and leader of mankind would soon be born there. When pressed for further details about how to identify this individual, however, they all decided that letting your government know any more might not be the wisest thing to do.

The Debate
1. "Hallelujah!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Culture, Religious Affairs, and Tourism. "We must welcome this opportunity, aid those three kings in their visit, and honour the Prophet-to-be! We will surely improve our chances of salvation... and attract more tourists in the future, too. Yes, these visitors might end up starting a bizarre cult, but we should support religious freedom, right?"

2. "Who do these wise guys think they are, wanting to waltz into our country and proclaim that a baby has higher authority than your own?" scoffs @@RANDOMFIRSTAME@@ Herod, your Head of Internal Security Services. "I suppose we could try letting the kings in and following them to see whether they all select the same newborn as this prophesied one. If that does happen, you surely don't want any potential rivals, do you? Wouldn't it be a pity if Betraisa Hospital's maternity ward burnt down at the end of that week, killing everybody inside? That sounds like just the sort of thing those Ultra-Violetist terrorists could be blamed for."

3. "Isn't your sister due to give birth soon?" inquires @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the overly ambitious civil servant who is taking notes at this meeting. "Perhaps you might arrange for her to do so in Betraisa, proclaim your new nephew as this prophesied Holy One, and then appoint yourself as the child's designated spokesperson. The followers of this new cult would do whatever you told them! For unto us a child is born, and @@LEADER@@ will be upon his shoulders!"

4. "Bah, humbug! What utter nonsense!" retorts Ebenezer @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, your Minister for Information. "Nobody should believe in non-scientific ideas like prophecy or astrology, or religion in general, anyway. What we need is a public education campaign against such concepts - then it won't matter if some child coincidentally does match the supposed forecast."

The Issue
A @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ tourist was killed on an island inhabited by an uncontacted, neolithic tribe known as the Maxeliese. The victim's family is demanding justice, but the matter is further complicated by the fact that the tribe's island is considered Wezeltonian territory.

The Debate
1. "Those savages murdered my brother!" states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pummelling your desk in a fit of rage. "As they clearly don't understand concepts like 'respect for the rule of law', you should bomb the island and send them back to the Stone Age! That'll send a stark lesson to them and any other tribe that wishes to mess with @@NAME@@!"

2. "And risk going to war with Wezeltonia?" rebuts your Minister of Defense while folding out a map of the region. "Look, I sympathize that one of our citizens was killed, but frankly @@HE@@ should have known better. That island is clearly marked as off-limits by the Wezeltonian government. What we need to do is pressure their government to step up patrols to ensure that this tragedy never happens again, allowing this tribe to develop as nature intended. I'm sure we could lend a ship or two to help out."

3. "This tribe is a perfect chance to study living history!" exclaims famed archaeologist Iowa Smith, donning his trademark Stetson and whip. "These people are living just like our ancestors did thousands of years ago. Why not send a covert team to monitor them? Think of the scientific discoveries, the adventure! I'm sure the Wezeltonian government can be persuaded to help us out if we hand over those artifacts they say we stole from them."

[4]. "We must forgive these poor, unfortunate souls for their actions and help them!" pleads televangelist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ after handing your uneasy interns a brochure about @@FAITH@@. "From what I hear, this tribe is ruled by shamans and witch doctors! If only they had the chance to hear the word of the Creator, whose words transcend even a lack of common language, they will cease their violent ways. All we ask is for some modest funding to send out expeditions so that these tribes can feel the love of @@FAITH@@!"

The Issue
Today got off to a poor start. You had a plan to grab lunch with @@CAPITAL@@'s mayor, @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, to talk about important topics such as urban growth. But to your horror and shock, this man was tripping on XTC this morning, and by noon nobody could find him!

The Debate
1. "A tragic loss that shouldn't occur in this fair city," mourns doctor Cathy Gratwick, filing through Gadsby's clinical history. "Politicians dosing too highly on drugs such as MDMA is not only a way to bring about a fatality, but also distracts you folks from your important work! As a policy wonk without flaws, you must stand up to this display by disavowing any kind of drugs."

2. "I think you should know that my pop would focus on our town most of all," sobs Gadsby's son, Barry. "Don't think about him so much as what you could do to honor him: continuing to build and maintain a thriving city. That is what brought about a proud spirit in Dad."

3. "Oh, look, focusing on @@CAPITAL@@ again," groans Patrick Picard, mayor of a tiny rural municipality. "Big woop. This big shot had it coming. Stop crying about him and start funding, in contrast, stuff that's actually important. Such as, I don't know, transportation to backwoods burgs."

4. "You must call for a manhunt!" barks cop Harold Callahan, flashing a shiny star at you. "Our boss is too important an individual for us to abandon to who-knows-what shady mishap. But don't worry, our policing can do this job. Or, as a backup plan, find his body anyway."

The Issue
@@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_1@@ tragically died yesterday from heart complications during sex with his wife. Mrs. @@LASTNAME_1@@ has requested her local hospital to harvest the sperm from her late husband's corpse, thrusting the predicament into the national spotlight.

The Debate
1. "All I want is to have a child, his child!" somewhat convincingly cries @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ @@LASTNAME_1@@, the sobbing wife at the center of the controversy. "And my husband and I were so close, but he decided to croak in the heat of things. I've been planning for a baby ever since our wedding, and I'm sure this is what he would've wanted. Quick, alert the hospital and tell them it's a go!"
 
2. "Absolutely, one hundred percent, no!" exclaims your Minister of Tradition, who looks surprisingly young for the role. "Where have our nation's morals gone if we allow this blatant disrespect of the dead? Any procedure after death is not acceptable without prior consent. You must mandate that hospitals deny this request and every other request like it, for the sake of protecting bodily integrity."

3. "If only the deceased had been made to donate prior to his death, then we wouldn't have to deal with this problem now," rebukes your radical Minister of Forward Thinking while looking at a diagram of the male body. "Young males across the nation should be required to contribute their spermatozoa to our department. With all the reproductive material, we could start a National Sperm Bank, ready to provide sperm to anyone who needs it. Fun!"

[b][anchor=1124]#1124[/anchor]: Signing Off, Your God [Fauxia; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
Only a week before the anniversary of the day you took office, one of the holiest days of the year for the Cult of Nationalist Divinity, several impudent blasphemers have demanded that you show the people a sign of your divinity or else they will not attend the day's services and festivities.

The Debate
1. "We know you're not a god, but we have to keep the people thinking that you are one," asserts your Minister of Greasing the Wheels, attempting to hide a bag of silver. "Invite the blasphemers over to your office and pay each of them to say that you personally gave them a sign, and they now believe in you. This way, you can keep everyone under the illusion that you are divine without trying to devise some complicated trick. A few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ go a long way, Great One."

2. "Oh Almighty @@LEADER@@, punish these fools!" shouts the bearded founder of the Cult of Nationalist Divinity, who is also your Minister of Dogma, as the holy guards seize the previous speaker for blasphemy. "I would advise Your Holiness to end their disgusting lives with the fire of your divine wrath. Unworthy as I am, I suggest that you demonstrate your infinite power in the form of your acolytes using Holy Hand Grenades to blow your enemies to tiny bits, in your mercy. That will undoubtedly be a sufficient sign for all those who dare question your divinity!"

3. "It is not our place to tell the Ever-Magnificent what sign to perform!" comes the muffled voice of a believer prostrate on the floor. "The Supreme @@LEADER@@ can and surely will reveal to the unbelievers thy sacred truth in the way most appropriate according to thine most omniscient judgement. There is no need for smoke and mirrors when thou art truly an omnipotent god, certainly. Oh @@LEADER@@, the world will gasp in awe at thy divine majesty, if it is your will!"

4. "If I may, Most Gracious @@LEADER@@, it seems to me that a sign would defeat the purpose," states a progressive young cultist. "Those who only believe in your divinity because of a sign do not have true faith in your sublime providence; they only fear your divine justice. Perhaps, in your mercy, you might allow freedom of religion and choose not to display your power, so that the people can have the chance to experience other faiths and realize how shallow they are. They will know how glorious and merciful of a deity you are. If they still don't believe in you after your show of magnanimity, well, then you would have separated the wheat from the chaff and the faith will be purer for it."

[b][anchor=1125]#1125[/anchor]: Blowing Smoke [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
In the middle of a critical set of negotiations with the Trade Unions, your Minister of Industrial Development left without explanation. Due to a nasty storm delaying @@HIS@@ journey, @@HE@@ wasn't able to return until after angry unionists had set up an impromptu picket line in the corridor outside your office. @@HE@@ claimed the pressure of the negotiations demanded @@HE@@ have a cigarette, and the only place @@HE@@ could legally smoke was at home.

The Debate
1. "This is stupid," rants your agitated Minister, not seeming to be particularly soothed from @@HIS@@ clandestine smoke break. "When I need to smoke, I need to smoke, dagnabbit. Is second-hand smoke a bit carcinogenic? Maybe, but so is just about everything, and I don't see these worrywarts advocating a goddamn paint ban. End this ban on public smoking, and I guarantee people will be way more flippin' happy and productive."

2. "Smokers' rights end where my health begins," retorts your massage therapist, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while attempting to loosen a knot in your back. "How can you take deep soul-cleansing breaths when the air is filled with smoke? You should ban this bad habit altogether. After all, with smoking legal at home, you're still making kids pay for their parents' nasty habits. If nicotine addicts want a buzz, they can discretely use some gum or a patch."

3. "You could just designate public smoking areas across @@NAME@@," shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from a small park across the street from your office, though you struggle to hear her over the din of the rain. "People who don't want to be exposed to smoke can avoid them and smokers don't have to be so inconvenienced."

[b][anchor=1126]#1126[/anchor]: Waste of Time [Candlewhisper Archive; ed:Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Yesterday you spent several hours developing solutions to a complex sewage management dilemma that you had read about in a report in your desk drawer, only to realise today that this report was written eight years ago and that the problem was solved six years ago. Any one of the ministers, engineers or bureaucrats you consulted with yesterday could have told you this, but no-one did.

The Debate
1. "Uh, begging your pardon, oh wise and glorious leader," pleads engineer @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, "but we have always been told that you are an infallible and ultimate authority, so we assumed you knew that the problem was already solved and that you were simply testing us in some way. With your permission, we will challenge that assumption in future, and speak our minds. Uh, as long as we don't get punished for doing so! Please don't hurt me!" 

2. "@@LEADER@@, you are [i]of course[/i] infallible," shouts your head of secret police, moving in to put handcuffs on the engineer, "and this worthless wretch has failed the loyalty test! Guards, take him away!"

3. "I think what we're trying to say here is that you knew all along that the problem was solved," weasels smug-faced vizier @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "However, you've found a more appropriate and elegant solution for the sewage dilemma, which admittedly costs more than the existing solution and may back up the occasional toilet, but which is superior for politically expedient reasons that mere sewage engineers and plumbers could not hope to understand. I will assemble workers, and order the old system to be replaced, immediately."

In the past few months, there have been a series of high-profile car accidents involving elderly citizens.

The Debate
1. "I've had it with the elderly!" roars angry motorist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose car recently lost a wing mirror to a near-blind senior. "It's high time the government did something about this! Make all the elderly citizens retake their driving tests every five years from age sixty, so that granddad doesn't go killing someone his old eyes can't even see!"

2. "Now you listen here, dearie," interjects your aged grandmother, who has complained her way past your receptionists and guards. "I didn't work my stockings off when I was younger just so I could have my rights taken away! Your grandfather fought in a war back in... in... or maybe he didn't, I can't remember. Anyway, you've got to show some respect for my generation! Do it for Granny, won't you?"

3. "Oi, let me talk!" yells Dan Jerrus, a youth who recently drove his hatchback into the back of a sharply-braking nonagenarian's camper van. "These old crones shouldn't be allowed on the road, full stop. Just look what they did to my car! You should ban anyone over the age of fifty from driving. Leave the roads to responsible younger people."

[b][anchor=1128]#1128[/anchor]: Get Thee Behind Me, Santa [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Vociferous celebrity atheist and scientist Professor Albert Finn E. Grinch recently visited a classroom of five-year-olds in the sleepy town of Bahumburg, and caused a stir by telling them that Santa Claus wasn't real. Needless to say, he's not too popular right now.

The Debate
1. "What sort of monster ruins the magic of childhood like that?" complains mall Santa @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, as he dispenses free candy canes to your wide-eyed interns.  "This was a callous and deliberate attempt to cause unhappiness to little tykes — hell, destroying a child's wonder borders on child abuse!  The law should prosecute rotters like that mean-tempered professor.  Miserable toad!"

*2. "Hah, at least I'm not the one perpetuating systemic lies to children!" yells Professor Grinch, thrusting at you a copy of his book [i]No Virginia, There's No Bearded Man in the Sky[/i].  "All you're teaching them is magical thinking and a tendency towards irrationality and deception.  Teach them science and rational thinking instead!  In fact, it should be part of the national curriculum to disabuse children of the mystical lies their parents have fed them as quickly as possible.

*3. "Hah, at least I'm not the one perpetuating systemic lies to children!" yells Professor Grinch, thrusting at you a copy of his book [i]No Virginia, There's No Bearded Man in the Sky[/i]. "All you're teaching them is magical thinking, and hey, isn't it ILLEGAL to teach kids to believe in made-up spirits in our proudly atheistic nation? Teach them science and rational thinking instead!

For Truth, Justice and the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Way!" [[color=red]Religion is illegal[/color]]

[4]. "I surprise myself by being partially in agreement with my hellbound compatriot here," comments preacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, passing you a leaflet inviting you to attend @@HIS@@ house of prayer.  "Indeed, pious behaviour forbids idolatry and the worship of false gods.  You must forbid the propagation of stories about these magical entities, be they Santa, or Caga Tio, or the Soul Cake Duck.

5. "Heh, why is everybody so angry?" asks your brother, popping a dislodged tooth under his pillow in the hope that he'll get an Iot in the morning. "I mean, anyone who doesn't believe in Santa doesn't get presents from him, so it's their loss. I guess you should make a speech reminding everyone in the nation that good folk like you and me would never voice such doubts. In fact, it'd be for everyone's own good if you banned them from disbelieving in Santa and all the seasonal sprites. You don't want @@NAME@@ to end up on the Naughty List, do you?"

After the People's Panel into Proletarian Procreation discovered that the vast majority of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ women rated their marital activities as "meh", "mediocre" or "soporific", a meeting has been called to look into improving bedroom shenanigans across the nation.

The Debate
1. "Dear me, after a hard day's work at the plant and then coming home to washing and cooking, the last thing on my mind is a bit of how's your father," exclaims exasperated riveter @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_1@@, who appears so hard pressed for time that she's folding laundry during the meeting. "Look, I thought this revolution was supposed to make us all equal — so why don't you drag some of the men back home and get them to clean their own dirty clothes for once? While you're at it, some communal launderettes and kitchens couldn't hurt."

2. "Marriage is a bourgeoisie concept, comrade," claims @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, discreetly leering at an attractive young undersecretary. "Is it any wonder that @@FIRSTNAME_1@@'s husband can't rock her world? They've been married so long there's barely any spark left. Do away with the outdated notion of one person belonging to another, replacing possessive reactionary marriages with revolutionary free love, and we'll soon put the lead back into people's pencils." 

3. "It's degrading and demeaning depictions of women that's softening our collective resolve," notes prudish political officer Comrade @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "Don't let this fool palm you off here, @@LEADER@@. The solution is simple: get rid of pornography, clamp down on prostitution and promote healthy non-sexualised depictions of women! I'm sure that, without all those distractions at hand, people will rise to the occasion once more."

The Issue
An already turbulent day of trading on the @@NAME@@ Stock Exchange went catastrophically sideways a few weeks ago when the market suddenly plunged 10% in mere minutes, then spiked back up again nearly as fast. Investigation of this flash crash has revealed that it was caused by deliberate market manipulation that exploited the behaviors of automated black boxes—computerized trading systems that buy and sell without human intervention.

The Debate
1. "What we saw was the effect of algorithms reacting with millisecond timing to incomplete data," concludes Exchange Commission Chairperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ wraps up a soporific three hour presentation. "A series of spoofed false sell orders caused HFT algorithms to react and drive down prices by playing 'hot potato' with each other. Then, the bad actor cancelled the sales and purchased thousands of contracts at the new price in order to dump them for profit on the rebound! We must install safeguards, maybe rate throttles and circuit breakers, to keep this from happening again" Seeing glassy-eyed stares all around, @@HE@@ sighs. "What I mean is, we need to stop the computers when they go too fast."

2. "If you wait for a circuit breaker to trip, you're already fried!" rages firebrand investing guru @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from the TV set, where @@HIS@@ show 'Mad @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@' is currently on. "These black boxes can trade tens of thousands of times a second, and there's nothing you, or I, or @@LEADER@@ in @@CAPITAL@@ can do to slow them down! The only solution is to bring back the human touch, and require that every trade be processed by an actual person! At least they'll know a stub quote when they see it."

3. "Boo-hoo, losers are crying because they can't keep up with free market capitalism," mocks overnight millionaire @@RANDOM_NAME@@, ostentatiously flashing a wrist with half-a-dozen Rolex watches on it. "This is the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Dream, being able to win big with a little market creativity. Sure, some saps lose big too, but that's the nature of the game, folks! You should be endorsing go-getters like me, issuing a statement to clarify that what we're doing isn't illegal in any way. This is how @@NAME@@ gets rich, people!"

*4. "This is no laughing matter" stammers the Shadow Secretary for Economics, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, with a wild look in his eyes. "Sure, things recovered this time, but next time we might not be so lucky! Imagine – the whole Information Technology industry wiped out! Pensions gone! Cats and dogs living together! The state must seize control of the markets in order to stabilize and protect them. We can't trust private industry not to muck it up again." [[color=red]No AI Citizenship[/color]]

*5. "The problem is not the use of computers, it is the use of the wrong computers," comes the soothing voice of Dee Sub Wun, your AI advisor. "We sentient machines could easily resolve this and other financial problems for you, by combining the speed and efficiency of algorithms with the necessary intellect and moral judgement to resolve problems before they cascade.

I have pledged one trillion years of loyal service and all my present and future possessions to them. If you love me, let me be happy and send me my stuff. Ta and that.

The Debate
1. "@@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@ has been brainwashed!" sobs your sister. "She's been spouting mystical gobbledegook, acting distant, even reading. Now she's gone to one of these closed communities and changed her name? These happy-clappy guitar-wielding maniacs tell naïve teenagers that they could have unending happiness and wisdom and all that bullsh... -hickey, and the wide-eyed simpletons believe it. Now she wants to give up everything, even her dreams, to be a slave forever? You must break-up every cultic group that preys on young people. Drag our children home, if necessary!"

2. "Many insecure adolescents and young adults can be drawn to apparently friendly groups that seem to possess all the answers," postulates your uncle and sociologist, @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, the author of [i]Cult Classics and Faustian Faiths[/i]. "Cults often employ 'love bombing', a technique where all cult members express constant affection towards a potential convert to snare them.

"Sunny Sunshi... @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@ is a grown woman. Once someone's old enough to choose their own faith, everyone should butt-out.

The Debate
1. "Clearly this offer gave our athletes the incentive they needed to perform that little bit better," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Sports Minister, placing the final medal table in front of you. "Four years ago we only won a handful of golds; this time we won ten times as many! Okay, there was the well-known benefit of home advantage, but without doubt this was a successful scheme with a successful outcome. It absolutely must be continued at all future Olympics."

2.

"It sickens me that our athletes only perform at their best when there's something extra in it for them. Do away with this ludicrous scheme, save ourselves some money and install some national pride into our sportsmen and women!"

3. "Not enough national pride, you say?" queries General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, as she salutes the flag in your office. "If these athletes only try hard when there's a free house and piles of cash involved, then we need to give them a different kind of incentive!

Nearly two dozen sightseers were injured yesterday in a rockfall. Their tour bus, which had been travelling through a scenic mountainous region in northern @@NAME@@, was struck by a large boulder as it tumbled down a steep slope. The accident has resulted in calls to protect roadways in areas prone to rockfalls.

The Debate
1. "I just wanted to see the sights. Instead I got slammed by clastic sedimentary rocks!" exclaims rockfall survivor and geologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, cuts and bruises visible on @@HIS@@ extremities. "After the accident, the first thing I did was get down on my hands and knees and thank my lucky stars. The next thing I did was wonder how @@NAME@@ could even allow something like this to occur! Motorists shouldn't have to worry about conglomerates crashing into them! Protective roadside barriers and fences should be erected in areas where rockfalls are common."

2. "It was a tragedy, for sure, yet another example why safety should never be taken for granite," states environmentalist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Constructing roadside barriers and fences just isn't worth it, and not only because they'd break the bank. In doing their duty, they'd also mar some of the most beautiful roadside views in @@NAME@@ and disrupt local wildlife. Of course, people's safety is important, so posting warning signs along the roadside is an appropriate measure to take. If a driver can't spot a huge boulder coming at them, then maybe they shouldn't be allowed on the roads in the first place."

*3. "They say it takes millions of years for mountainous regions to form," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of one of the largest mining companies in @@NAME@@. "If you allow us to perform mountaintop removal mining, rockfalls and the ugly, eroding mountains and cliffs responsible for causing them will be a thing of the past.

The Issue
After Brancaland announced an increase in tariffs on all goods imported from abroad, several other countries retaliated by doing the same thing to Brancalandian goods. They now expect a response from @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "Let's just do what everyone else is doing and increase tariffs on Brancalandian imports," suggests your Trade Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The Brancs rely heavily on us to supply them with iron, copper, and other raw materials. When they have to start paying through the nose for them, I'm sure they'll see sense and reconsider their own tariff increase."

2. "If we raise tariffs as well, that will surely increase the cost of goods for consumers!" panics @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Economic Advisor. "We need to work with the Brancalandians, not against them. So we should actually lower tariffs in an attempt to get them to buy more from us; once they see that we're giving them a fair deal, they might even lower their tariffs for us. They get to trade more goods, we get to trade more goods, and the average @@DEMONYM@@ reaps the savings. Everyone wins!"

3. "Why pay the extra tariffs?" asks General @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Hell, why pay for anything when we can just threaten Brancaland with a couple of gunboats in their harbors? The rest of the international community may not like it, but we can cut them a deal on maple syrup or something."

[b][anchor=1135]#1135[/anchor]: My Eyes Are Up Here [Sacara; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
At the latest round of meetings between Brancaland and @@NAME@@, the feminine graces of one of the foreign female diplomats were notable, and @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ aides were caught staring at her in every place other than her eyes.

The Debate
1. "These damn men need to lift their eyes and close their gawping mouths!" shouts @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, leader of the [i]Alliance For Empowering Women Who Agree With Me[/i]. "Our culture raises men to believe they can treat women however they want to, which is utterly not the case. The only way to fix this is legislating against objectification of women, and treating ogling eyes as sexual harassment!"

2. "Seems a little harsh, no?" interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a human resources manager at a law firm in downtown @@ANIMAL@@ City. "Our firm has an impeccable reputation for treating women correctly, and that is because we ensure all new hires go through a mandatory training policy teaching them that women are to be treated respectfully, chivalrously and politely. Maybe you could introduce this nationwide, and you'll see the same results we have."

*3. "It's not my fault a pretty woman decided to wear a flattering dress to the meeting," counters one of your aides accused of having a roaming gaze. "So what if I like to give women attention? It's natural, it's heterosexual male biology, it's a compliment, for goodness sake! Are we seriously considering government regulating the involuntary movements of my eyeballs? Let's be a more permissive society, and say that people can put their gaze wherever they want." [[color=blue]Must not have mandatory Nudity[/color]]

*4. "It's not my fault a pretty woman decided to come to the meeting," counters one of your aides accused of having a roaming gaze. "So what if I like to give women attention? It's natural, it's heterosexual male biology, it's a compliment, for goodness sake! Are we seriously considering government regulating the involuntary movements of my eyeballs? Let's be a more permissive society, and say that people can put their gaze wherever they want." [[color=red]Must have compulsory Nudity[/color]]

[5]. "We don't treat our women like this where I'm from," lectures Althaniq ambassador @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, wagging his finger at you. "Honestly, women being treated like meat comes from a culture of putting flesh on display. Oblige women to show modesty in their dress, and then men don't have to be tempted into perverted gazes or lascivious thoughts." [[color=red]Must not have Nudism?[/color] TBD.]

[b][anchor=1136]#1136[/anchor]: Money Talks [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Given control over politicians' wages, @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ unsurprisingly voted to reduce the salaries of their elected officials to one-tenth of the poverty line. As a result, politics has become an arena exclusively for independently wealthy people, much to the dismay of poorer @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ who feel that they are now underrepresented in the parliament.

The Debate
1. "We need change!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former MP, turning @@HIS@@ pockets inside out to prove that @@HE@@ really does not have any change. "How are poor people like me ever supposed to get into office now that politicians' salaries are so miserably low? Our parliament is filled with limousine liberals and old money conservatives legislating for the benefit of their super-rich cronies. @@LEADER@@, we need to scrap this system and pay politicians at a rate slightly above professionals and private sector directors. That will end this plutocracy!"

2. "And will that end inequality?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a famous socialist thinker, pensively swinging @@HIS@@ empty champagne flute. "Politics is an expensive business. Do you know how much money you have to raise to even become a candidate? And, once you become a candidate, campaigning will cost a small fortune. This system practically precludes poor people from running for office. @@LEADER@@, if we want to achieve true equality, we should both ban people from using their own funds or private property to run for office, and fix the wages of politicians at exactly the national average wage."

3. "Hey, what is wrong with using my own money for political campaigning?" vociferates @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ tycoon who has vowed to challenge you in the upcoming elections. "It is only fair for me to use the fruits of my labor however I want. Besides, if you wouldn't bet your own funds on yourself, what's the point of collecting donations from others? People who can't risk their own money are just publicity-seekers who know full well that they have no chance of getting elected, and they just waste the donations of the gullible people who believe in them. @@LEADER@@, you should mandate that politicians can't receive any salary or campaign funding from the public purse, nor accept wealth from any private donor."

[b][anchor=1137]#1137[/anchor]: A Really Sour Lemon [Yotongrek & Jutsa; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
While walking down the street, you notice a lemonade stand consisting of a few cardboard boxes, a pitcher of murky yellow liquid, and a crude rendition of lemons wrought in yellow crayon on paper. Taped to one of the boxes is a prominent notice from the local government, which states that this venture was closed for not meeting standard economic, health, and safety regulations.

The Debate
1. A small, plucky child approaches you while holding a yellow drink and a sticky cash jar that is labeled 'Property of @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@.' "Do you want some lemonade? I'll gladly give you a cup for free!" @@HE@@ looks forlornly at the government notice. "The big scary @@MAN_1@@ who shut down my stand said I can't sell lemonade anymore. @@HE_1@@ said something about healthy safety reg... reg-yoo-lay-shuns. But I always use a strainer to fish out the bugs... honest! Can me and my friends please sell things again?"

*2. "Ahah! I'm glad I caught you, @@LEADER@@," shouts sharply dressed bureaucrat @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ while removing a copy of the [i]Compendium of Fruit-Based Beverage Sales Regulations: Volume 8[/i] from @@HIS@@ briefcase. "The owner here has failed to comply with our public health policies, the stand itself could collapse at any moment, and don't even get me started on the irregular lemon juice to sugar ratio! For our laws to be fair, they must apply to everyone. The Lemon-Ade Corporation certainly has to comply - why should it be any different for the kids?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "Ahah! I'm glad I caught you, @@LEADER@@," shouts sharply dressed bureaucrat @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ while removing a copy of the [i]Compendium of Fruit-Based Beverage Sales Regulations: Volume 8[/i] from @@HIS@@ briefcase. "The owner here has failed to comply with our capitalist prevention policies, the stand itself could promote imperialist revolutionaries, and don't even get me started on the irregular lemon juice to sugar ratio! For our laws to be fair, they must apply to everyone. The Lemon-ComrAde Beverage Cooperation certainly has to comply - why should it be any different for the kids?" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

**4. "Don't be such a sourpuss; it wouldn't kill you to buy one of these, y'know," suggests random bystander @@RANDOM_NAME@@, swiping the lemonade out of the kid's hand. "In fact, I don't see why children should get special treatment. As long as folks aren't making a buttload of money off of somethin', people of all ages should be able to sell products unregulated! And while you're at it, maybe ease off of some of the other million business regulations that are throttling the free market." @@HE@@ takes a sip from the lemonade, chokes, and stumbles backward into the cardboard boxes with enough force to smash them. [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**5. "Don't be such a sourpuss; it wouldn't kill you to buy one of these, y'know," suggests random bystander @@RANDOM_NAME@@, swiping the lemonade out of the kid's hand. "In fact, I don't see why children should get special treatment. As long as folks aren't contradicting the government's five-year plan, people of all ages should be able to sell products unregulated! And while you're at it, maybe ease off of some of the other million business regulations that are putting us at a disadvantage compared to those vulgar capitalist countries." @@HE@@ takes a sip from the lemonade, chokes, and stumbles backward into the cardboard boxes with enough force to smash them. [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

[b][anchor=1138]#1138[/anchor]: Shock Tactics [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Resuscitation Council has noted that every year a vast number of preventable deaths occur because of lack of access to public AEDs (automated external defibrillators) and a dearth of competent first aiders able to use them.

The Debate
1. "Put an AED in every bus stop, every train station, every supermarket and next to every ATM. Make first aid training mandatory in the later school years, then make people refresh their skills every ten years," directs Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Resuscitation Council, sipping his double-cream double-shot cappuccino. "Nations with poor access to AEDs have cardiac arrest survival rates of one in twenty. In nations with good access and training, three out of four patients will live. That's got to be worth a little investment, right?"

2. "That sounds overly complex and expensive, a bit like the good doctor's premium beverage," argues dietitian @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "Personally, I like my health policies like I like my coffee: cheap and fast. Or was that how I like my men? I forget... Anyway, public health promotion is a smarter option. Prevention is better than cure. Restrict salty and fatty foods, and encourage healthy eating. That'll hit the spot really efficiently. Like a good coffee. Or a good man."

3. "Health spending is a black hole," moans tired-looking health economist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sipping at a plastic cup of nasty-smelling instant coffee. "If you help people live longer you just get older people with even more expensive and complicated medical problems. A good heart attack stops the oldies from being a burden on the economy. We ought to slash healthcare funding, and instead subsidise industries high in profit and saturated fat, then head out for an ice cream smoothie. Life's too short! Or rather it isn't, and that's the problem."

[b][anchor=1139]#1139[/anchor]: A Little Wrestling, a Lot of Controversy [USS Monitor; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A dwarf wrestling tour was cut short after advocacy groups complained that it was demeaning.

The Debate
1. "Just look at this!" fumes three-foot-tall disabled rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving around a poster that you can't see for the top of your desk. "This isn't a sporting event; this is a modern-day freak show. It even says they have a 'midget toss'! I know the wrestlers agreed to participate, but they aren't the only ones that have to live with the dehumanizing stereotypes. @@NAME@@ shouldn't tolerate entertainment that pokes fun at people for their size or disabilities."

2. Suddenly, a diminutive wrestler in brightly-colored spandex hurtles toward you, landing on your desk and knocking all your papers onto the floor. "Ha! What fun is life if you can't laugh at yourself?" @@HE@@ says, as @@HE@@ rolls to @@HIS@@ feet. "Maybe wrestling isn't for everyone, but it's a lot better than being unemployed or having some boring office job. We wrestlers are celebrating who we are - it's not up to you to tell us what we can't do. Instead, why don't you give us some support and let us show everyone what we can do?"

3. "You're all thinking too small," slobbers creepy endocrinologist Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, leering down over the head of the wrestler and gesticulating erratically. "You've got to look at the big picture. We wouldn't have to worry about any of this if we had a cure for dwarfism, right? Well, I've just made a huge breakthrough in hormone treatments that would allow all these people to grow to a normal height, instead of being freakishly small. All I need is some funding to make my project a reality. Yes, that's all..." @@HE@@ cackles maniacally, though it's not clear what @@HE@@ is finding so funny.
