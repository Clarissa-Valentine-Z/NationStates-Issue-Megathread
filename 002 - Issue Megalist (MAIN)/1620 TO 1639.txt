[b][anchor=1620]#1620[/anchor]: Ballooning Out of Proportions [Cha-os; ed: Kaschovia][/b]

The Issue
Your latest meeting with industry executives on soaring helium import prices is suddenly interrupted by reports of a gigantic white balloon floating fifteen kilometres in the sky over @@NAME@@. Quite worryingly, it appears to be hovering over a classified missile containment facility.

The Debate
1. "It's those damned devils from Dàguó again!" curses your bullish Secretary of Defense @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shoving @@HIS@@ way into your office. "It's always them... this is an unacceptable assault on our sovereignty and we cannot let it slide! Say, if they're so curious about our superior weapons arsenal, I have a Mach 23 Dragonbreath surface-to-air missile primed and ready to blow that blasted balloon to smithereens! It's about time we took back control of our own airspace, don't you think, @@LEADER@@?"

2. "Yes, our intelligence strongly suggests it is them..." confirms your Minister of Domestic Security @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pointing an arbitrarily long stick at an unrelated map. "Sure, they might have acquired some blurry images of one military facility with this balloon, but should we really be wasting millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ firing missiles at it? We reserve the right to respond to their acts of espionage, and we should — by launching our own fleet of cutting-edge spy balloons back at them! Who knows what they've been hiding in those mountains?"

3. The Dàguó hotline rings and your secretary puts it on speaker mode. "Oh @@LEADER@@, we are very sorry for this very unexpected turn of affairs! It's just the wind — you know, such blasted wind. This is not a spy balloon, but actually an oversized gender reveal balloon... Yes! It's a gender reveal to celebrate the coming birth of our prince — or princess — we don't know yet! We humbly ask that you clear your airspace for the balloon to continue on its course, so it may safely arrive in Dàguó where we will burst it at the palace of the Celestial Emperor. Once again, we are very sorry!"

The Issue
The government's hard-line ban on cars and planes has drawn criticism in the aftermath of an emergency landing of a space shuttle that left the @@NAME@@ Space Agency with no other recourse than to collect the shuttle via a convoy of horse-drawn buggies.

The Debate
1. "It's just not practical," gripes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of @@NAME_INITIALS@@SA, who reeks of something nasty. "We put together these multi-billion @@CURRENCY@@ missions, and when they're over, we collect the shuttle with horse-drawn carriages.

[b][anchor=1622]#1622[/anchor]: Border Burden [Ostrovskiy, Giovanniland; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
The border between Bigtopia and @@NAME@@has long been a messy one, with several so-called 'pene-exclaves' — @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ lands that can only be effectively accessed by passing through Bigtopia's territory, and vice-versa. This challenge, brought on by the mountainous terrain, has been brought to the fore by an unexpected letter from Bigtopia's ambassador.

The Debate
1. The messenger bearing the letter bows deeply, and presents the document for your perusal. It reads, "@@LEADER@@, these pene-exclaves negatively affect the lives of both our nations' citizens, who often have to deal with border crossings and bureaucracy to fulfill their basic needs. They also cost a fortune to administer. On behalf of my nation, I propose we exchange these lands so that there will no longer be territories that can only be accessed by crossing a border. The affected citizens of each nation can then choose between moving to a new location in their home country, or beginning the citizenship process where they are."

2. "Do we even care about these lands?" questions avaricious Minister of the Economy @@RANDOM_NAME@@, pointing at a map with scorn. "Only a few thousand @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ live there, yet we pay the high price of having to provide services. Did you know that their annual per capita tax revenue is only half the national average? If Bigtopia wants these areas, let it buy them off us and take care of the residents themselves, along with the ones in their own exclaves! We get a bit of cash, and it'll allow the use of taxpayer money for better purposes, like lining our pockets... err, I mean focusing on the more prosperous parts of the country."

3. "Are you insane? Think about our citizens!" cries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Foreign Affairs, who passed through three border checkpoints on the way to work today. "They'd have to give up their ancestral land in order to stay with us, or else suddenly wake up in a different country! Why don't we just sign a mutual free border agreement with Bigtopia? If you live in an exclave, you'll be able to travel without a visa to and from the mainland, and services such as the fire and police departments would be allowed to cross the border too. I'm sure we can trust that their citizens won't exploit this to gain access to other parts of @@NAME@@." @@HE@@ shakes the hand of the Bigtopian messenger, and quietly dismisses them.

4. "Is that Bigtopian rascal gone yet? Splendid! The elephant in the room is that we allow a weak nation like Bigtopia to push us around!" scoffs Minister of War @@RANDOM_NAME@@, tearing the letter and throwing it in the trash. "Why would we want to sign deals with them or sell our land? A far easier solution would be to intimidate Bigtopia into ceding the travel corridors we want! Run a series of military exercises along the borders where @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ need to cross, and inform those big-noses that we need freedom to move our troops back and forth to the exclaves for our own national security. See if we can get control of their exclaves too, to smooth this mess of a border."[/box]

The Issue
@@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ was given a medical ventilator in place of lungs, a hemodialysis machine in place of kidneys, and an artificial heart, all while suffering from paralysis, amnesia, and a wicked hangnail. Hospital administrators are concerned that this is just one of many cases where these limited resources could've been used to help people more likely to recover to a normal life. Your aides arranged a hospital visit to discuss this matter and score a few brownie points.

The Debate
1. "This one @@MAN_1@@ — who is barely even alive at this point — is costing @@NAME@@ a fortune," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of the Northwest @@NAME@@ Hospital Fund while reading from a suspiciously ornate clipboard. "Despite @@HIS_1@@ urge to stay alive, we think it's best for everyone if we pull the plug. Yes, it sounds cruel, but the resources would be better spent saving many more lives. Please, let us euthanize patients in conditions like these."

2. "N-nooo...I... grandchildren... nooo..." whimpers the faint old voice of @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ before @@HE_1@@ passes out. @@HIS_1@@ nurse steps in after dispensing some hand sanitizer. "It is @@HIS_1@@ wish to live, and it should be our job to see to it @@HE_1@@ lives. Are we really putting a price on someone's life? We can reallocate government funds from other departments, especially the military, to take care of our citizens. We need more life and less death."

3. "We wouldn't have this problem if only patients who are willing and able to pay up got treatment," argues a @@MAN@@ in a three-piece suit who seems determined to stay as far away from everyone in the room as possible. "We shouldn't babysit those who haven't worked hard enough, or spent all their money on Pear Phones and avocado toast. If they can't afford it, they should have made better decisions when they were healthy.  We need to ditch the universal healthcare system and only treat people who can pay. It takes care of our limited resource problem. Win-win."

The Issue
@@CAPIPTAL@@'s railway system has come under fire recently after relatives were allowed to ship their deceased family member in a baggage car.

The Debate
1. "Surely you can't object to what we did?" asks the dead @@MAN@@'s sibling, looking strangely at ease considering @@HIS@@ recent loss. "Our parents wanted her buried in the family plot back home... and that's a fair trek by horse and cart. The government should stay out of our business and let dead people on trains! So what if I put her in a mail bag? Coffins aren't cheap, you know."

2. "You can't let this happen," weeps traumatized city worker @@RANDOMNAME@@, who wasn't on that train, and who hasn't actually ever been on a train. "It's surely upsetting to be forced to witness death up-close! Not to mention it must smell horrible, and is probably unhygienic. You must ban the transport of corpses in trains used by the general public!"

3. "There's always a compromise to be had," whispers @@RANDOMNAME@@, your pallid Minister for Transportation, touching your shoulder softly as @@HE@@ leans to your ear. "Many people have good reasons to transport dead bodies from one place to another, but not everybody is as comfortable with them as you or I. So we simply fund a separate train system.

[b][anchor=1625]#1625[/anchor]: At What Price? [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A recent trend has had journalists asking members of your cabinet mundane questions, like how much a carton of milk costs, to see if they are out of touch with everyday life.

The Debate
1. "I haven't researched the exact figures, but I expect milk is expensive nowadays — certainly more than the poorest in society can afford," prevaricates your Welfare Minister, dodging the question as usual. "That's why we must commit to raising welfare payments for those in the lowest income brackets. Because we care." @@HE@@ turns to the camera and gives @@HIS@@ best earnest-but-sympathetic look.

2. "Last I heard, milk prices are too low, probably. Definitely not enough to support our dairy farmers," complains your Minister of Agriculture. "Supermarkets are underpaying powerless dairy farmers who can barely cover the cost of production. Regulation is needed for a fair minimum wholesale price. Let consumers and retailers carry the cost burden, not the milk producers!"

3. "I think milk is relatively cheap at point of delivery, but in terms of environmental externalities it costs far too much," lectures your Environment Minister, who sources her oat-almond-mung bean mylk blend from a refill shop at 4 @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ per 100 grams of CO2. "Dairy herds, and animals in general, are hugely inefficient in kilojoule-per-hectare indices, and bovine burps produce a lot of greenhouse gases. We need to transition to pure arable farming, and pure veganism."

4. "Oh, do you mean Damien Emin's piece [i]A Carton of Milk Left on the Counter Overnight[/i]?" enthuses your Culture Minister. "3.5 million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ at auction, if I recall. You know, we ought to be subsidising art and artists more, to encourage more modern art of this quality. I mean sure, the milk stinks a bit, but only literally."

5. "We're missing the point here, which is that 92.5% of your ministers really are out of touch," complains civil servant Vicky Pedia, who is a veritable goldmine of unverified statistics. "What you need is mandatory earpieces for every minister, with a fully staffed fact-finding team on call ready to relay them a perfect answer they need as soon as they get asked any tough question."

The Issue
A curious new weight loss fad has wormed its way into the world of fat slimming in @@NAME@@ — deliberate self-infection with tapeworms.

The Debate
1. "Tapeworm therapy is revolutionary!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the procurers of this peculiar slimming aid, whilst squirming in @@HIS@@ seat and clutching @@HIS@@ stomach. "These days, the disadvantaged amongst us just don't have the time or money for balanced diets or physical exercise. But with some help from a little buddy in our tummies who can take in all the extra calories we consume, we can look beautiful once more. You should definitely promote these methods to the public! Of course, some people are going to develop a couple of... complications here and there, but what medicine doesn't have side effects? Also, unrelated question: do you happen to know where the nearest toilet is?"

2. "Let's not open this can of worms too hastily," cautions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a nerdy researcher from prominent pharmaceutical company Mhizer, as @@HE@@ flips through a thick clipboard containing colourful charts and coffee stains. "There's been plenty of research into the risks and rewards of using tapeworms to lose weight, and there's a pretty clear conclusion — it sucks, and we're not referring to lost body weight. But, guess what? Thanks to rigorous trials conducted by yours truly, Mhizer's approved weight loss pills can help you burn up to 10% of your body fat in a year without too much risk! It's true, many consumers can't afford conventional methods of losing weight, so you should subsidise the production of our wonder pills to give everyone the equal opportunity they deserve."

3. "You've all lost your damn minds," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Health, as @@HE@@ shoves a couple of nauseating images of patients' intestines in your face. "Weight loss pills can be harmful if used improperly, and worms? Hello, diarrhea, vomit, stomach pain? Are you kidding me?

After a school district in western @@NAME@@ reported twenty centimeters of snow following a monstrous blizzard, students in the region are in uproar as the local education board has set up virtual classes for the kids instead of calling the day off.

The Debate
1. "Oh, this is going to be great!" rejoices Western @@NAME@@ School District Superintendent @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ barges into your office and kicks off @@HIS@@ snow boots. "With all of these technological advancements, no student will ever need to miss a day of school again! Say your goodbyes to snow days and sick days... heck, we should ban all days off school and require that every district offer accessible online classrooms. "

2. "You can't do that to us!" objects student rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, standing proud at the front of @@HIS@@ school posse. "You have to understand @@LEADER@@, there's nothing better than getting that school cancellation email when heavy snow is forecast and our weary bones need a rest from the elements. Just do away with all of this virtual school stuff and let us kids enjoy some time off for once."

3. "I'm afraid I must agree with the child..." says professional optometrist and personal healthcare expert Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wiping frost from @@HIS@@ vintage frames. "In fact, we could take it a step further. If we allow these virtual classes, nearsightedness in children will skyrocket, further fuelling the worrying rise in myopia rates across @@NAME@@. What do you expect to happen when people are glued to their screens all day? Not only should we forbid all online classes, we should also put strict regulations on the screen time of children throughout the nation. Twenty-minutes ought to be more than enough!"

"Not only could we have virtual school on snow days, we could have virtual school, like, basically all of the time, you know?

The Issue
A recent study has found that there are a significant number of young @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ who have withdrawn from society completely. This phenomenon, known overseas as [i]hikikomori[/i], is associated with extreme social isolation and refusal of almost any interaction outside of the internet.

The Debate
1.  "There are a lot of reasons why someone could end up friendless and isolated," pointedly observes psychologist @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, as you recline on @@HIS_1@@ chaise longue. "These social isolates have a multitude of mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety and internet addiction. These all make it perfectly understandable for them to want to stay at home rather than facing the outside world. A well-funded program of active intervention will solve this issue: regular visits from psychologists, counseling for the whole family and mandatory social activities to get the hikikomori to leave their homes."

2. "Ten-hut!" screams Drill Sergeant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while barging into the room with a battering ram. "I'll tell you why these useless little maggots won't leave their home — their coddling parents enable them! Why would these freaks ever feel the need to leave their house when mummy and daddy provide for their every need? Bah, it disgusts me. Call in the troops to forcibly remove these loners and send them to my boot camp for a week or three. Don't you worry, we're going to whip them into shape."

3. "In the enlightened state of Dàguó, they've limited youths to three hours of videogames per week, and only on Fridays and Saturdays," observes Minister of Youth Maria Poppings, encouraging you to take some time from your office to go fly a kite. "Of course, to enforce such measures we'll need all games to only be playable whilst online, with mandatory age verification, online activity tracking and a ban on VPNs. We'd better get straight to it, spit spot!"

4. "Hell is other people," notes Jean-Pascal Montmartre, one of @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@'s clients who is peering through the space where the door once was. "Throughout your time as leader, have you enjoyed every single interaction with your citizens? I don't think so. You can probably see why many people don't want to leave their homes at all. These people are off the streets and stay out of trouble; instead of shaming them we should be lauding their example and encouraging others to do the same. Requiring employers to enable working from home, subsidising delivery services and upgrading internet networks will allow people to live their lives with minimal human contact."

"'Twas only a year ago — me good mate Captain Morgan allowed eight women to board his vessel, and after setting sail a huge and mighty storm blew up.

3. "The expense!" hisses your exasperated Minister for the Treasury, recoiling at the word 'free' as he clutches the latest budgetary report. "Look, I'm as much a monarchist as the next commoner, but flags and cultural exhibitions? Really? Why don't we just have the Royal Family announce a tax cut to mark the occasion instead? The spending spree will give retailers a nice boost and people will associate that with the monarchy, bolstering support for it. Everybody wins! Except anti-monarchists, but they're all buzzkills anyway."

Last night, a religious festival was raided by police who were executing a search warrant, right in the middle of a special service marking [i]Erator[/i], the holiest annual celebration of the [i]Tranquility of Yellow[/i] — a truculent sect devoted to self-flagellation. However, the search found no evidence of criminal activity – and Yellowists nationwide are livid at this perceived violation.

The Debate
1. High Priestess Taina Swiff storms into your office in an agitated furor that belies the name of her religion. "I knew these cops were trouble when they stormed in. Our holy temple has been completely and thoroughly violated! The non-believers have corrupted our chakras, handled our holy scrolls, and sullied our sacramental cheese and crackers. Do you know how long it will take to perform the Ritual Dance of Sanctification? Secular police should respect religious ceremonies of all sorts, and wait til they have ended before acting."

2. "Hey, you need to calm down. The anonymous tip we received clearly stated that the Yellowists were running a human trafficking ring out of the basement of this address," claims @@CAPITAL@@ Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@, projecting a defiant air of authority. "Yes, we just found out that the actual human trafficking operation was being run out of the back of a pizza place down the street — but we didn't know that at the time. Look, we had a warrant.

We're not apologizing, and we explicitly shouldn't be required to pay any compensation money for the items that were accidentally damaged, or the delicious cheese and crackers that somehow vanished."

3. "Or, we could just choose the obvious solution — exile," declares @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@, your bigoted cousin who is a frequent guest on the @@ANIMAL@@ News Channel. "Round up the Yellowists and deport them. Even if someone else was responsible for this particular crime, you know that these religious extremist types are petty, dishonest criminals by nature. In fact, why don't we just deport everyone who doesn't follow a normal religion, like @@FAITH@@?"

[b][anchor=1633]#1633[/anchor]: Do You Think He's Overcompensating for Something? [Genbu Kaiden; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Larger and heavier cars have proliferated in recent years. These have been linked to higher fatality rates after collisions with pedestrians and smaller vehicles, as well as causing traffic problems on narrower roads.

The Debate
*1. "When we make and sell these big boys, we're simply responding to what the market wants from us," grins industry CEO Ivor Biggun, adjusting the voluminous waistband of his business suit. "People just want to be safe when driving in an increasingly hostile environment, and if they have to buy heavier, more expensive cars to feel safe in, then we'll service that need. Maybe you need to accept the trend, and instead spend some money on wider roads, bigger parking spaces, and subsidising folk who need a little financial assistance to make the upgrade." [[color=blue]Must allow Private Industry[/color]]

*2. "When we manufacture and distribute these big boys, we're simply responding to what the masses desire," grins industry director Ivor Biggun, adjusting the voluminous waistband of his worker overalls. "People just want to be safe when driving in an increasingly hostile environment, and if they need heavier, more expensive cars to feel safe in, then the state must service that need. Maybe you need to accept the trend, and instead spend some money on wider roads, bigger parking spaces, and investing in upgrading the nation's cars." [TBD]

3. "Some of us own normal sedan cars, and are sick of finding ourselves hemmed in on all sides by tanks," complains a nervous looking man, who is wearing a shirt two sizes too small. "I accept that industry and workmen need trucks, but is it sensible for the average commuter to be taking up all this road space? Surely you can at least ban them for normal non-business drivers, and maybe also restrict the installation of unnecessary lift kits, bull bars, and other after-market modifications that make a large vehicle bigger and more unsafe for everyone else outside of it."

4. "Do people really need cars at all, though?" asks a passing jogger, whose figure-hugging lycra bodysuit leaves too little to the imagination. "Auto manufacturers are in an arms race to make bigger, heavier, more dangerous cars. If we want safer roads and a cleaner world altogether, then motor vehicles should be banned outright."

[b][anchor=1634]#1634[/anchor]: The War of the Planets [Il Sonno della Ragione Genera Mostri; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
Last night, panic spread throughout @@NAME@@ after a broadcast by the film director and radio speaker Orson Wheels, in which he announced an alien attack — and subsequent invasion — in the rural area of @@ANIMAL@@ Mills. Many people, fearing the end of civilisation, poured into the streets in an attempt to reach safety, as accidents, robberies and fires ensued. However, Mr. Wheels was simply reading a screenplay of his upcoming movie, [i]The War of the Planets[/i].

The Debate
1. "Orson Wheels must be arrested and held accountable for all damages caused by broadcasting this fake news," demands Ulla @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, a cleaner who has just finished picking up piles of broken glass scattered across the streets. "In fact, why don't you make it illegal to deliberately spread disinformation?"

2. "Oh come on, I assumed the listeners would realise it wasn't real," states Orson Wheels, as he clears his throat, "I just wanted to arouse some curiosity towards the new movie and well, it worked; this morning five producers have called me already. You can't hold artists responsible for the public's reaction to their works, oh and you'd better increase the sanitation budget so this mess gets cleaned up."

3. "Last night's events have taught us one thing — amidst the perpetual tensions with Blackacre — we are totally unprepared to face a threat of this kind," claims Thomas Cruiser, a concerned dad holding his child in his arms. "Everyone needs to be taught the correct measures if something like this happens for real. The government should start an awareness campaign with alien alerts, exercises and training. Then everyone will know what to do in such an emergency."

4. "No, no, no and no! IT WAS REAL!" screams Tim Collins, the creator of the 'They Live Between Us' conspiracy magazine. "I've just come back from @@ANIMAL@@ Mills, and take a look at my video... Okay, they may seem like just farmers ploughing the soil, but I KNOW they are aliens; they took some human skins and they are covering their gigantic tripod machines under the ground in preparation for the invasion. We must stop them and bomb everything here within five miles!"

[b][anchor=1635]#1635[/anchor]: A Sine of the Times [West Barack and East Obama; ed: Westinor][/b]

The Issue
Many students have complained that their compulsory maths classes, which teach topics such as calculus and trigonometry, are of no value to them.

The Debate
1. "Take a look at my exam question! 'If X is equal to the number of @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ in West @@CAPITAL@@ Nature Reserve, and the derivative of cos(x) is equal to the number of @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ in East @@CAPITAL@@ Nature Reserve, what is the rate of change of @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ in @@NAME@@?' Why do I need to know this?" wails frustrated student @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "All maths classes teach these days is confusing gibberish. None of this is even going to matter to me — I want to become a photographer, not a nerd stuck in a basement doing calculations for the rest of my life. Maths curricula should be reworked to teach basic mathematical skills that would be applicable to the majority of the population: such as filing taxes. All the other mumbo jumbo should be optional."

2. "Actually, topics like calculus are vital to a student's education, even if they don't currently realise it!" interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a 'cool' maths teacher. "Sure, the majority of the population will never have to use the actual maths concepts in their occupations. But they will need problem solving skills and the ability to think outside the box, both of which are strengthened by learning advanced mathematics! Maybe if we revamped our teaching methods to make maths seem less boring and 'cringe' and more fun and 'based', students would have a greater appreciation of the subject and benefit from it more? I've got a couple of ideas about adding these 'meme' things kids love into our textbooks..."

3. "Most students won't ever use these maths concepts? Well, sounds like we should change that," mutters philistinic engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ furiously scrawls equations onto @@HIS@@ child's fingerpaint artwork. "Maybe if we stopped flushing money down the toilet by funding these 'artistic' deadbeats and instead spent it on mathematics-oriented industries, people would realise that taking pictures of the sunset or whatever isn't a productive way to contribute to society and will finally get off their butts to study hard and get proper jobs. That'll give those complainers somewhere useful to invest their clearly ample free time."

[b][anchor=1636]#1636[/anchor]: In for the Long Haul [Umbratellus; ed: Klaus Devestatorie][/b]

The Issue
A scheduling mishap has resulted in your arrival at the @@CAPITAL@@ Convention Centre, not to find throngs of your ardent supporters, but rather the 'Transportation of Tomorrow' Expo in full swing. Shrugging @@HIS@@ shoulders, your error-prone junior secretary suggests you should look around for something that 'looks cool' to commission, and then abandons you to get some bubble tea at the food court.

The Debate
1. Catching a glimpse of your Minister of Transportation amidst the crowds, you find @@HIM@@ admiring a gleaming new high-speed rail locomotive. Seeing you, @@HE@@ gestures towards the railcar, "A real beauty, isn't it? Rail technology has always been astonishingly efficient for long distance trips. This model even has heated seats! Imagine fantastic machines like this one hauling passengers between every town and city across @@NAME@@ — we have the opportunity to set the global standard for mass transit! We could expand existing railways and break ground on new ones within cities as well: light rails down every major thoroughfare, monorails with dedicated stops inside major tower blocks, even micro rails that could deliver groceries! I could go on and on — oh, just think of all the new trains!"

*2. As you continue meandering through the halls of the convention centre, you find yourself in a crowded room dedicated to an impressive array of concept cars. In the midst of a showcase of vehicles powered by everything from hydrogen to solar panels, an excited spokes@@MAN@@ is gesticulating wildly in front of a sleek model. "Our thorium-powered concept car can run for a century on just 80 grams of fuel! Dirty, polluting, petrol cars are about to be a thing of the distant past! When we complete our laser micro-reactor, we can be positioned to fully roll these out across @@NAME@@ for sale. Once we have our self-driving technology running, we're planning to make a fleet of them available for public use. Imagine never needing to wait for the bus again." [[color=blue]Must allow cars[/color]]

*3. In a small room you find an eccentric man in a lab coat, lecturing in front of a 3D projection of a cow. "Oxen have long been a staple of transportation for both people and cargo, but what if we could make them better? What if we used genetic engineering to breed a community stable of super-cows — Über-moo-nschen if you will — to transport everyone around? We can select for enhanced speed and stamina, and a more efficient metabolism. Artificial hormonal supplements will ensure continuously elevated levels of testosterone for maximal muscle growth! I've even drawn up a design for an intravenous harness pump that would ceaselessly deliver creatine, but — HEY!" The figure abruptly dashes off stage, chasing after a bioluminescent pooch that slipped out of the room. [[color=red]Must not allow cars[/color]]

**4. At the centre of a large stage filled with flashing lights and lasers, celebrity entrepreneuse Ellen Moss is hyping up a crowd of adoring fans. "Say it with me, everyone. Personal! Rocket! Ships! We're all going TO THE MOOOOON!" As attendants wheel out a gleaming rocket model on stage, the lasers turn together to form the SpaceY logo against the hull of the spacecraft. "We believe EVERYONE should have the right to fly, not just licensed pilots. We're going to have this bad boy on the market in just FIVE YEARS. You can even pre-order one today! Space is the next frontier for humanity, and with these incredible ships, we can REACH FOR THE STARS TOGETHER!" Ellen raises her fist in the air, to the sound of wild applause. [[color=blue]Must allow aircraft[/color]]

**5. A @@MAN@@ waves to you from the pilot's seat of a small blimp, which is bouncing alarmingly off the ceiling of the pavilion. "Tally-ho old chum! We're poised for a revolution in lighter-than-air travel. These newfangled electric propulsion motors can run on nothing more than some solar panels and a rechargeable battery pack!" While fighting to maintain control in the face of the convention centre's air conditioning system, @@HE@@ continues. "If you'd just let everyone get off the ground again, we could usher in a whole new age of adventure! Imagine, grand passenger zeppelins soaring through the hoary aether! Great air-freighters, laden with cargo, ushered on by billowing jet streams! Not everyone has the stomach for it, but it'll be marvellous! The future is right above our heads!" [[color=red]Must not allow aircraft[/color]]

6. On the way to the food court to locate your junior secretary, a grumpy old @@MAN@@ gestures at you. "Bah," he mutters, "have you ever heard such a load of claptrap in your life? I can't even find a seat on the subway in the middle of the day, and these cranks are trying to sell us delusions! How am I supposed to get to a doctor's appointment on time if I have to rely on whatever ridiculous pie-in-the-sky scheme has your personal attention at any particular moment? The government should stop flushing money down the drain on worthless experiments like these that never go anywhere, and spend it on regular old public transportation that regular old folks like me actually can use!"

[b][anchor=1637]#1637[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Children of the Atom [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
A class action lawsuit has been filed against the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ government by Brasilistani families whose health has suffered as a result of the radioactive fallout from your nuclear strike against their nation. Children with cancer, men and women dead from radiation poisoning, and farmers whose livelihoods were destroyed after their soil was contaminated are all being named as direct consequences of the atomic bomb you dropped.

The Debate
1. "We're guilty as sin, and we as a nation have a moral responsibility for our actions," explains your Minister of Manual Wringing, who yesterday formally apologized for lightly bruising a mugger's fist with his face. "We should pay reparations to survivors, and offer funds to help rebuild their country and their lives. We should also issue a statement of regret over our actions, and acknowledge that it was a mistake to use nuclear weapons. Let's face it, Brasilistan was on its knees at the time... we could easily have won the war through conventional means. Making amends for our misjudgement is the right thing to do."

2. "It's a legal nonsense to bring the wartime actions of a state to account in a civil court," asserts Field Marshall Dunn-Torkin, holding up a clenched fist for emphasis and grinning slightly as the Minister flinches. "Deny the authority of any court to try this case, and put surveillance on the would-be plaintiffs. Resentment and hatred are breeding grounds for terrorism, and we would be wise to be watchful."

[3]. "Those Brasilistanis are like roaches... miss a few, and they start multiplying again. They're filthy, disgusting creatures!" yells your brother, spitting on the floor. "Luckily for you, nuclear payloads are now bigger and better than before. If we nuke them again, this time there won't be anyone left to complain." [[color=blue]Must allow WMDs[/color]]

[b][anchor=1638]#1638[/anchor]: The Waiting Is the Hardest Part [Jim the Baptist & Dabarastan; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
The government's notoriously long visa processing times are in the spotlight after @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ — a Maxtopian who has already been waiting 13 months for @@HIS_1@@ @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ student visa application outcome — just received a request for additional information.

The Debate
1. You begin reading a letter from @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, @@HIS_1@@ heavy Maxtopian accent echoing in your head. "I applied for a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ student visa over a year ago; now my whole life is on hold and I'm having to work menial jobs in Maxtopia in order to finance this period of waiting. I beg you, triple funding and promise a respectable wait-time limit on your visa apparatus so my fellow international students and I may study at one of your benevolent and dazzling institutions."

2. "Do you have any idea of the processes involved in checking the validity of an application?" counters immigration officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ rounds up all the pencils on your desk. "There are criminal checks, academic suitability checks, financial capability checks and so on. All of this takes a prolonged period of time in order to be done properly. In fact, there should be no more upper time limit on the issuance of a visa; we have to take as long as it needs."

3. "This land is your land, and this land is my land," croons folk singer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ through your open office window. "Who are we to say where this fine young student can or cannot study? Abolish all student visas, man!"

*4. "Abolish all student visas, you say? I think that's the first clever thing this long-haired yahoo's ever said!" spurts alt-right commentator @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You can forget about all that other hippy garbage though. There are too many foreign 'academics' muddying our sovereign soil already. Stop issuing these visas and kick out those students already here." [[color=blue]Must allow immigration[/color]]

*5. "Abolish all student visas, you say? I think that's the first clever thing this long-haired yahoo's ever said!" spurts alt-right commentator @@RANDOM_NAME@@.

[b][anchor=1639]#1639[/anchor]: Bad Coal Models [Crodelinam; ed: Kaschovia][/b]

The Issue
Over the last few weeks, protestors from the organisation Extraction Rebellion have been gluing their hands to buildings, defacing priceless paintings, and flinging dye bombs (and worse) at public buildings. After the steps to Parliament had several hundred kilos of cow manure dumped on them, your advisers have urged you to put your foot down.

The Debate
1.  "They just want to be heard..." remarks your Minister of Environment, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dropping apple slices out of the window into one protestor's waiting mouth. "I mean, most of these 'criminals' are just concerned young people. They'll probably be distracted by whatever the 'trendy' issue is next week and forget what they were even angry about. What they really want is a dialogue and, at the very least, an agreement to reduce our coal usage. I can have a statement drafted in five minutes and this little problem will be gone."

2. "Just agreeing to reduce coal usage does nothing!" bellows avid Extraction Rebellion spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@, adorned in a high-vis jacket and hard hat with the prop store tags still attached. "We demand the immediate closure of all @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ coal extraction facilities, without any decade-long mission objectives or backwards anti-protest measures! It's time to save our planet and protect our future!" @@HE@@ charges out of the room to rapturous applause from a crowd of paint-covered students outside.

3. "These damned protestors!" sputters your Minister of Crime, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, frantically wiping red paint from @HIS@@ even redder face. "Not only do these people damage our reputation as a nation with manners, but they're outright laughing in the face of your authority! If peaceful and appropriate protest is not a part of their insufferable and relentless schedule, I'd say it's time we gave their most outspoken advocates a clear choice: their silence, or more... direct means of negotiation. A couple years in the coal mines should do the trick, right @@LEADER@@?"
