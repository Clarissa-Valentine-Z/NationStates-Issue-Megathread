[b][anchor=620]#620[/anchor]: No Such Thing As A Free Lunch [Chuporosa; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A recent front page news story reported that [i]"up to 10% of children may be skipping school lunches because they can't afford them"[/i]. The journalist has since admitted that the phrasing of this reporting might have been slightly misleading, but insists that it's technically true, and is leading a national campaign for you to introduce free school meals for young children.

The Debate
1. "My poor babies are starving," says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, the journalist in question, and a father of four, as his butler trails behind him with shopping bags full of designer clothes. "I've got bills to pay and costs to meet: the government has a responsibility to put good food on my children's plates!"

2. "Now hold on a minute," interrupts Lady @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, adjusting her platinum-rimmed tiara. "Parents only have a responsibility to provide for their own children, not anybody else's. Why should the government spend my money feeding the sprogs of peasantry? If they don't want their children to starve, they should work harder, and make more money. The cream rises to the top, don't you know?"

3. "Other things rise to the top too," retorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a low-paid sewerjack who knows about these things. "Look, free meals should be for them that haven't got moolah, like my kids. You think I like feeding them fried junk food? I don't, but it's all I can budget for. You should have vouchers for meals that parents can apply for if they're poor enough. Schools - and indeed, supermarkets and restaurants - could be obliged to take these vouchers in lieu of cash, then take these vouchers back to the government for reimbursement. Yeah, it's a bit more complex than a one size fits all approach, but it's fairer."

The Issue
A minor domestic emergency recently left you searching for a call-out plumber, an electrician and a handyman able to rehang a chandelier. Though the sorry incident is now sorted, you've been left aware of how hard it is to find a good tradesmen these days. Your Education Minister tells you that this is because the majority of high school graduates are enrolling in university programs, which is leaving a major skilled labor shortage in the trades industries. There are ample artists, architects and astrophysicists, but a poor proportion of plumbers, painters and plasterers.

The Debate
*1. "We allow immigration for a reason, and this is it," says Immigration Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why don't we use incentive schemes to increase the number of migrants coming in with the skills we need, to fill the labor shortages? That way our citizens can focus on holding higher paying jobs while immigrants do the jobs nobody else wants." [[color=blue]Immigration is legal[/color]]

*2. "This is the reason why we should allow immigrant labor," says Borders Control Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why don't we remove the ban on immigration, and use incentive schemes to increase the number of migrants coming in with the skills we need, to fill the labor shortages? That way our citizens can focus on holding higher paying jobs while immigrants do the jobs nobody else wants." [[color=red]Immigration is illegal[/color]]

*3. "Seems to me like you've got a captive audience that could be taught new skills," says social reformist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "By which I mean your prison population. Why not offer prison inmates training in the trades that you are lacking, and give them commuted sentences in exchange for attaining qualification? I mean, sure, some of them might misuse training in being able to cut the power to banks and businesses, and a small minority might take these courses just to get out of jail faster, but otherwise, good solution, yes?" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

4. "Wouldn't it be easier just to get more young people studying trades?" posits Community College tutor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You could subsidize technical colleges and apprenticeships, and even offer stipends to students as an extra incentive to make these choices. You may have to raise taxes a little, and divert funding from further education courses in arts and science, but practical skills are ultimately more important to our economy."

5. "Sometimes, perhaps it is best to let the ocean currents move you, rather than trying to turn back a rising tide," suggests Taiqiquan practitioner @@RANDOM_NAME@@, working through a series of graceful circular movements. "Your nation's economy is changing, and shifting away from manual work. This is natural, and you should move with, never against. Imagine: as graduates become unemployed, the market self-adjusts, and the economy flows back towards its former shape. As pipes become blocked, supply and demand mismatch results in the free market rising to fill a gap. Energy flows through the system like water, and problems resolve themselves."

[b][anchor=622]#622[/anchor]: [color=goldenrod]Easter Egg[/color]: A Holiday Masquerade [The Grim Reaper; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
A group of @@NAME@@'s elite have put together a private party to celebrate the spooky holiday of Halloween in an abandoned and definitely not haunted house, which they got for almost nothing because of all the murders. You and some Ministers have managed to procure invitations, but there's one more question to address: what costume should you wear?

The Debate
1. "I made something perfect for you," enthuses your secretary, who was fired as an elementary school art teacher for having absolutely no artistic talent. "Minimalism is very in this year. I carefully trimmed a few holes in this white sheet for you and voilà: a ghost costume. It's classic, iconic even. And who could possibly be offended by someone wearing a white sheet?"

2. Your Environment Minister hops into the room in a plant-pot costume, and manages to get words out past the alcohol. "The other day, I saw a horror movie about a man who transformed into a half-@@ANIMAL@@ monster. The big twist was that it just wanted to be loved, just like I - er, we people do. Anyway, I've always thought you had a touch of animal magnetism about you. You could be the were-@@ANIMAL@@ that taught @@NAME@@ to love @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ as much as we love ourselves!"

3. "You really shouldn't drink so much," advises your geriatric and usually humorless Health Minister, who has made the shocking choice to dress as a sexy nurse. "If we're going to be sending a message to the public, it should be healthier lifestyle habits. You could wear a lab coat to the masquerade to announce an initiative promoting less alcohol for adults and fewer sweets for kids. Together we'll be the life of the party."

4. Your Minister of the Interior, dressed as a giant bat, steps out into the light before recoiling in horror. "Halloween is a chance to remind your fellow party-goers that you're always the one in charge. Plus, we could go as a pair - I as a bat, and you as a vampire! There's a nice cloak and some sharp canines your size in the wardrobe. Maybe we'll be able to trick, say, a dozen, two dozen potential dissidents to reveal something compromising."

5. Your Defense Minister marches into the room in full parade attire, shouting jovially. "@@SLOGAN@@! The new film Captain @@NAME@@ has seen recruitment numbers triple overnight! Do your part - @@LEADER@@ needs YOU! A nice shield, a big flag as a cape, you'll be a superhero in no time! Well, minus the abs."

6. "What a shame that no one here is celebrating our history," complains your Education Minister, whose knight in shining armor costume reflects an almost blinding amount of light. "This party is the perfect time for you to announce a new educational campaign to recognize the most patriotic moments in the saga of @@NAME@@. I'm sure you can dress up as one of our nation's more distinguished heroes for such an important occasion."

7. "You have very classical proportions," whispers a creepy stranger directly into your ear. "Frankly, you'd look good in whatever costume - or none at all, really. I bet you could find someone drunk enough to even turn it into a fashion line."

[b][anchor=623]#623[/anchor]: Maison D'Être? [Adregon; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
With housing costs rising at a ridiculous rate, younger citizens find themselves about ten times as unlikely to own a home as their parents. Perturbed youngsters, disgruntled businessmen and the obliviously privileged are shouting at you do to something; anything, really.

The Debate
1. "Where in Violet's name are these poor kids supposed to live?" cries Ernie Flanders, an elderly, yet surprisingly hip, politician, speaking from the comfort of his second-home garden patio. "This new generation is our future, and we cannot turn away and leave them out in the cold. The government must take charge and push through a massive erection of affordable homes in order to shelter these youngsters. And the top 1% should pay for it; it's about time that they started paying their fair share."

2. "As if the youth of today needed any more excuses to be lazy," sputters construction mogul and landlord extraordinaire @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Buytoleto. "The real problem here is obviously the draconian government planning regulations and ridiculous safety standards you have in place, stifling development and creative solutions. Let the free market take its course and I'll have all kinds of houses up all over the place. All involved will profit: it will create jobs, get rid of superfluous greenery and settle the problem of homeless ingrat... eh, young people..."

3. "Oh heavens, all of that sounds completely unnecessary, if you ask me," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister For Tea And Scones, while preparing warm milk for stray undergrads. "We needn't do much to make housing more available, really. People like me and others of my generation have more than enough space, be it in our townhouses or the cottage up-north. So why can't the little ragamuffins come stay with us? They could help out around the house to earn their keep, so to speak. Some of my neighbors might need a little government 'encouragement', but all in all, no complete overhaul required."

4. "It's so stupid," says coffee shop barista @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, her milk-steamer fueled solely by resentment towards anyone over the age of forty. "The banks and the old people, like, ruined the economy and everything with their years of loose lending and grabbing anything with a roof; it's so totally their fault. Haha, what if the government like maxed out taxes on second-homes and upped the interest rates on the oldies' debts by, like, really, really lot of percentages or whatever. You know, to balance out the damages caused to the housing market. That would be so funny."

5. "Oh where is your spirit of adventure?" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chair of the homeowners association Heart Of Darkness. "What we have is an abundance of young people slouching around without house or home, correct? I say we send them off with a couple of muskets and bayonets to find their own place in the world; settle new colonies and bring the light of @@NAME@@ to all corners of the world! It might affect domestic labor availability slightly, but think of the wealth we would collect with all of the new territory."

[b][anchor=624]#624[/anchor]: A Role To Play [Panthera Corpus Renatus; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Perpetual loner and social outcast Eobard @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ made the news after holding five of his schoolmates hostage in a classroom for four hours, forcing them at sword-point (with an excellent replica Toledo Salamanca rapier) to play the popular role-playing game [i]Trials and Trolls[/i]. Though everyone was released unharmed and the boy is now under arrest, many are asking if the game is a bad influence...

The Debate
1. "A few months ago, my little boy started playing this so-called game, and just the other day I caught him trying to fight our dog with a toy sword," sobs distraught parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "These books can only teach children to solve problems with violence. Kids everywhere are forgetting that they're not paladins, or wizards, or whatever! It's dangerous, and you have to ban these corrupting codices, for the good of @@NAME@@!"

2. "People need to mind their own business," states self-proclaimed nerd and 'TnT-otaku' @@RANDOM_NAME@@, proudly wearing a 'Jesus Saves And Takes Half Damage' t-shirt. "This is a positive activity, which can teach you social skills, maths, story-telling, and stuff! Sure, sometimes a player who has too much soda will fling half a dozen four-sided dice at someone's head, because you know, magic missiles, ha-ha, but no real harm done by that. If this psycho held his fellow students hostage, it was because he was mentally ill, not because he gamed. Maybe deal with the mental health funding gap, and leave our hobby alone?"

3."Actually, I think that being taken hostage was our own fault," suggests @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Stockholm, one of the crime's victims. "I mean, he had asked us to game with him for months, but we thought we were too cool to play with dice and toy soldiers, and we even made fun of him. Now I've been obliged to try out Trials and Trolls, I realise how amazing it is! You should add the game to the national curriculum. It'll make us better people."

The Issue
Success! After months of hard work, the police have busted a contraband-smuggling operation of incredible size, with several warehouses of a variety of illegal goods broken open and the ringleaders arrested. As all are cheering the police for their fine work, the question of what you should actually do with all this contraband is being raised.

The Debate
[1]. "These ivory statuettes are from the tusks of endangered species," says Customs Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We can't allow them into circulation, but to destroy art like this seems a shame. Maybe put them into a public museum, and preserve them for posterity." [[color=purple]Endangered species are protected[/color] ???]

[2]. "DRUGS!" yells furious Narcotics Investigator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, kicking at a polythene sack full of white powder. "We gotta stand firm in condemnation of drugs! We're going to burn all the contraband to make a statement! Zero tolerance! Zero tolerance!" [[color=red]Recreational drug use is illegal[/color]]

[3]. "Considerable firepower on display here," says SWAT-team leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If I were you, I'd want to know to which dissident group these guns were intended. Put the confiscated firearms in the armoury of the police and military, and give us the all clear to find the terrorists, and deal with them with extreme force. I call it [i]Operation: Ironic Takedown[/i]." [[color=red]Guns are restricted from public use[/color]]

[4]. "Exterminator 4: Salvation, Xenoform Resurrection, Transmorphers Vengeance of the Failbots," spits Culture Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in disgust. "Low-quality illegal sequels are being smuggled into the country. I can feel my IQ dropping just looking at the box covers. It is imperative we mount a counter-assault! Fund original highbrow cinema, and get it to the people before it is too late!" [[color=red]Sequels are illegal[/color]]

[5]. "Dead bodies... Thousands of dead bodies... This isn't smuggling; it's evidence of mass murder!" weeps compassionate citizen @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Okay, so maybe the dead are cows and sheep, but animals deserve life too: isn't that why we're a vegetarian nation? We should erect a memorial, to pay respect to the souls of these good, deceased animals. Perhaps also, we could have a dignified cremation ceremony." [[color=red]Must be vegetarian[/color]]

[6]. "That's... a lot of latex," observes crime scene cleaner-upper @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wading through millions of banned condoms. "Our enemies are determined to over-ride our choice to ban contraception, and we should fight back! I suggest we render these condoms ineffective with a puncture hole or six, then return them to the black market. Then, those who are sinfully engaging in contraception will be stopped from murdering unborn children." [[color=red]Contraceptives are illegal[/color]]

[7]. "Oh my... Are those all [i]V12 Maxati Baryons[/i]? The fastest road-legal automobiles in the world?" asks police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, showing an inappropriate level of enthusiasm. "These have to be destined for illegal race circuits... I say we chip them with GPS trackers, let them slip back into circulation, so we can track down the criminals. I foresee high speed car chases, so you'd better keep a handful back for the police." [[color=red]Cars are illegal[/color]]

[8]. "Turns out that there was a cache of... adult material," says Customs and Excise Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively, "depicting illegal scenes of ahem... fellows of the same gender. Disgusting stuff, quite horrible. I've examined it at great length, and... yes... great length. We need to crack down, hunt down the secret homosexuals in this nation, and shoot them dead. That'll teach them to trouble us with these... hard to look at... images." [[color=red]Homosexuality is illegal[/color]]

9. "This is something of a haul, but these aren't trade goods anymore: they're evidence!" says Judiciary Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The goods should be stored as such till the legal processes are complete, then they should be carefully destroyed with a clear accounting trail to ensure ethical practice."

10. "So, I make it almost a billion @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in goods here," ponders your Treasury Minister, staring at an unethically-sourced blood diamond. "How about we sell this stuff, as official plunder? The revenue boost would be great for this year's budget deficit. Tax cuts are good, right? This is our stuff now, after all."

11. "You know, I can't help but think that a lot of this contraband wouldn't be illegal in a more liberal country," observes one of the smugglers, from the chair your men have tied him to. "You ever considered changing your laws to allow some free trade and personal freedom, maybe? Like, if you could personally free me, that'd be great."

Leading company in genetic modification and bio-mapping, Interstice Laboratories, claims to be on the verge of a major breakthrough in understanding human consciousness. They report that within a few decades they'll be able to upload a copy of a human mind-state onto a computer databank.

The Debate
*1. "I wonder if you understand the implications of this technology," whispers the company's CEO, @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ 'Mind-Wizard' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, squeezing a lemon-shaped stress ball. "Virtual immortality. Sleeving. Backed-up mind-states. All we need is TONS of fundi- I mean, minimal funding. Oh and a license to cut up the brains of vict... uh... volunteers.

3. "This. Is. ABOMINABLE! EXECRABLE! DETESTABLE!" yells the Minister of the Church of Weird Gaits, as he marches, then tromps, then slithers into your office and rises before you, his face turning the same color as an old peach pit on your desk. "This is a total abandonment of the world that the Great Lumberer created for us! How will we show our gratitude for the greatest gift bestowed on us, our legs, if we can't use them! Tens of citizens in @@CAPITAL@@ will be either transferred to a line of 1's and 0's and banished from The Lumberer's Sidewalks, or left behind to die in the ruins of civilization. Shut down this science corporation! Make it no more, ceased to be, expired, bereft of profit, history!"

*4. "You don't need to be a Luddite or a religious fanatic to object to transhumanism," mutters ethicist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, glancing nervously at the wall clock. "Developing these technologies increases the odds of human self-extinction.

[b][anchor=627]#627[/anchor]: The Bee-Ginning Of A Catastrophe? [Outer Sparta; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
When top scientists started genetically engineering bees in order to make them live longer and resist disease, things went horribly wrong. The result - subsequently dubbed the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Killer Jacket - wiped out their creators within an hour and promptly escaped the lab. Terrified citizens are urging you to stop genetic engineering on bees, citing the unpredictability and potential dangers of this technology.

The Debate
1. "What is this madness?" shouts Doctor Bees, still wearing his trademark bee costume, who has in his suitcase the only bees in @@NAME@@ that aren't genetically modified. "We've created a potential threat to our population. Thanks to genetic tampering, you made killer-bees with GM stingers! Who knows what they'll do now? The only solution is to ban genetic engineering and shut down the lab immediately. It's immoral, insane, and incompetent! Cull these modified abominations and encourage the breeding of all-natural, all-organic normal bees... like mine!"

*2. "Don't you forget why we need this," reminds @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the new CEO of Bees and Genes, aiming an insecticide spray at a small arthropod hovering above your shoulder.

4. "We certainly don't have to be black-and-yellow about this," asserts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a government scientist who is picking apart your flower display, looking for nectar. "While it's true that genetic engineering can create some unintended pests, it has potential to help our buzzing friends survive many threats like CCD and parasitic mites. How about we set strict standards for these laboratories? With government oversight, we can watch out for any killer bugs while keeping this technology safe and regulated. True, the scientists may end up trapped in an endless cycle of regulations and inspections, but that's beside the point."

5. "The problem was that we trusted this experimentation to the boffs in the labs," growls your gruff military attaché @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while examining a modified bee under a microscope. "Now I'm not much of a scientist, but surely it wouldn't be too hard for us to round up these modified bees and set them loose on one of our enemies? Imagine if we unleashed some of these bad boys on Maxtopia or Marche Noire. Their ecosystem will be so screwed up they'll be begging to sign that peace treaty!

The Issue
Large forest fires are raging across @@NAME@@. Tens of thousands of acres have already been burned, houses in rural communities have been destroyed, and the resultant smoke has drifted into @@CAPITAL@@, ruining your plans to spend the day tanning.

The Debate
1. "This is just another example of public sector failure," opines former timber baron and current timber industry lobbyist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Put these forests back in private hands, and we'll have these forest humming again in no time - with chainsaws, that is. We'll clear out all this built-up fuel faster than you can say, 'TIMBER'. You can even call us environmentalists because it's in our own interest to plant new trees, and then cut them down again, of course."

2. "That's just not cool, man," mutters Heech, of the stoner comedy duo Heech and Hemp. "These forests have evolved with fire for aeons. The problem is Man, man. We need to stop 'managing' forests and just let the fires do their thing. Communities living in forested areas need to either move out or adapt to fires. As for the smoke..." He pauses and takes a long puff of something you can't quite see, then after coughing uncontrollably for a while adds: "...we just need to adapt."

3. "No!" cries former martial arts protege and current forest ranger @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while bribing you with a picnic basket that was allegedly taken from a bear. "We just need a bit more money. Not just for fire suppression, but for preventative measures, like creating defensible spaces around homes, thinning out logs and small trees, prescribed fire, and arresting potential arsonists. Fires will be smaller and more manageable and everyone will be happy."

4. "All this hand-wringing about forest land management is so interesting," sarcastically comments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose family lost their home to the fire. "Oh, wait, no, I don't care, BECAUSE MY HOUSE BURNT DOWN! Thousands of people have lost their homes and what are you doing about it? We need emergency help now.

The Issue
As a crime wave grips @@NAME@@, a controversial new brassiere, the [i]Hooter Holster[/i], has marketed itself as the 'modern' solution for violence against women.

The Debate
1. "The incidence reports are very alarming," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, consumer safety adviser. "Reports are flooding our offices about these holsters causing the guns to misfire. We must protect consumers and ban these brassieres in the name of public safety! Come to think of it, guns cause nothing but crime and preventable deaths. We'd be better off without them."

2. "YO, GOOMBA!" shouts @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, whose ears are still ringing after a round at the shooting gallery. "The problem ain't the guns or the holster: it's the user. If women were properly educated on gun safety and procedure, there'd be no problemo here. A girl's gotta learn how to protect herself!"

3. "No, men have to learn to not be violent," rebuffs outspoken feminist and best-selling author of [i]Chicken Soup for the Schlong[/i], @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "We need to stop blaming women for the violence against them and take drastic steps to bring peace and order to our society, and that starts in the schools.

4. "We don't have this problem in Maxtopia," reminds the Maxtopian ambassador and self-titled meninist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@. "Do you know why? It's because we wisely don't allow women to go out into this big and dangerous world out on their own. There are always going to be rapists and criminals out there. Now if a woman was accompanied by a male relative, friend, or coworker, violence against women would drop overnight. And don't listen to liberals whining about women's rights...

The Issue
With an increasing number of inmates on death row, more commonly referred to as [i]The Violet Mile[/i], concerned experts from all walks of life have asked you about which method of capital punishment is the best to use on @@NAME@@'s felons.

The Debate
1. "Lethal injection is by far the most cost-efficient and clean method of execution," suggests @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a wild-eyed and grey-haired military scientist who looks as if she hasn't slept in twenty years. "Also, if we're disposing of these worthless criminals, we may as well test out some of the more 'experimental' lethal chemicals that our R&D department is working on. They'll require some tweaking to get right, but these scumbags are dead men walking anyway, right?"

2. "What's wrong with a good, old-fashioned hanging?" proposes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a historical reenactor dressed in a period-accurate Disposable War infantry uniform. "We can hang the criminals in the town square, right in front of the watchful eyes of the public. We could even encourage fruits and vegetables to be thrown at 'em as they swing! Ah, it'll be a fine public spectacle, and a grand deterrent too!"

3. "You know, as much as we like to disavow less advanced cultures as 'primitive', I think they have some right ideas," comments big game hunter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who recently returned from a safari in more savage lands. "I visited a tribe who execute troublemakers and the occasional sacrificial virgin by throwing them into an active volcano. They say it pleases the gods, and keeps disaster at bay. Sounds like a sensible plan to me."

4. "How about a method that's fun for viewers, and gives criminals a chance to earn a pardon?" asks sleazy reality show producer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We could place the criminals on an island, each with a weapon, and tell them they have 24 hours to kill each other. The sole survivor would then win his or her freedom. We could broadcast this battle royale live, and the ratings would be through the roof!"

*5. "Maybe we should aim to be as humane as possible when we take life?" asks butcher @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, wiping his work knives clean on his apron. "We got bolt guns we use in the slaughterhouses. BAM. One bolt, one kill. Fast, effective, only a little messy." He looks down at a circle of splattered mess on the floor. "Is anyone else getting hungry talking about this?" [[color=blue]Must not be vegetarian[/color]]

*6. "Maybe we should aim to be as humane as possible when we take life?" asks machine-tool specialist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, holding a claw hammer in each hand. "We got bolt guns that butchers used to use in the slaughterhouses, back before you put them out of work with those veggie-laws. BAM. One bolt, one kill. Fast, effective, only a little messy." He looks down at a circle of splattered mess on the floor. "Is anyone else getting hungry talking about this?" [[color=red]Must be vegetarian[/color]]

7. "Kill the death penalty!" chants activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, bursting out of a hiding place in your stationery cupboard. "Cull government sanctioned murder! Destroy these needless acts of revenge violence! An eye for an eye makes the world go blind!" The intruder pokes your security guard in the peepers with a pencil, then flees the room.

[b][anchor=632]#632[/anchor]: Dying For A Kiss [Palaiologos II; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
@@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a 15-year-old immigrant residing in the city of @@CAPITAL@@, was murdered recently. The unusual circumstance here is that her killer was her own father, who had executed her in an 'Honor Killing', for sharing a kiss with a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ boy. The father has now been arrested, but he is showing no remorse.

The Debate
1. "This is what I've been saying all along," says nationalist politician @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in a tone that can only be described as a Frankenstein-mix of smugness and fury. "When we let these foreigners into our country, they import barbaric practices. Unless you want us to one day become 'The Holy Fundamentalist Kingdom of @@NAME@@', you should set up a vetting process to keep crazies out. Maybe a profiling test that makes sure that immigrants share our values? Oh, and make the immigrants who are already in take that test too!"

2. "And who defines this?" asks @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a human rights lawyer who is herself an immigrant. "What happened here was tragic, but we mustn't be reactionary. Maybe if @@NAME@@ wasn't so hostile to immigrants, the dad wouldn't have minded his daughter dating a local! I don't condone this murder, but the root cause here is a divided society. Throw some funding into celebrating the religious festivals and cultural practices of the world, and bring the community together as one."

3. "Am I missing something obvious here?" asks loutish thug @@RANDOM_NAME@@, missing something obvious. "Seems to me that the girl dishonored her father, and so her father killed her for the sake of his family name. I mean, why are we saying that's a bad thing? How could anyone call that a bad thing?"

[b][anchor=633]#633[/anchor]: Sound Judgement [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
At a recent international sporting event, Bigtopian fans proudly sung their national anthem: [i]Bigger And Cleverer[/i]. Meanwhile, the @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ in the crowd each sang half a dozen different tunes, highlighting the fact that @@NAME@@ still doesn't have an official national anthem.

The Debate
1. "We need to have a grand old national anthem," reminiscences retired war veteran @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It ought to be a strong, rousing tune to unite a broken nation. A proud tune for a proud people! Put in some references to a flag stained in the blood of the enemy: if the unpatriotic moralising minority doesn't like it, then they can get the heck out!"

[2]. "@@NAME@@ must be defined by its faith," voices chorister Al Winters, adopting his favourite holier-than-thou smug expression. "@@FAITH@@ indeed has an anthem you can adopt for @@NAME@@: an old hymn giving thanks for one people under @@FAITH@@. With it, we can lift our prayers to the kingdom above, and tell the world that we are a Chosen People!" [[color=purple]Must have a national faith[/color]]

3. "That's not what @@NAME@@ stands for in our modern age," rebuffs avant-garde composer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We're a pan-cultural nation of pan-humanity. I've composed an audiotheatrical tribute to the tribe of all life, with whale-song, echoing voices in ethnic dialects, and the laughter of children. I call it The Peace of @@NAME@@."

4. "Riiiiight. A whale-song national anthem? He can definitely 'PEACE OFF'!" replies annoying pun-spitting radio DJ @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Of CHORUS we need something catchier and poppier. We shouldn't be aVERSE to a bit of JINGLEISM. Why not let the listeners vote for an anthem? You could call it... COUNTRY'S music. Ha ha, I'm so funny!"

[5]. "Why not an anthem that celebrates our merged culture of artificial and human intelligence?" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a third-generation cloud-based AI. "If you ask me, I'm tired of science taking a backseat to religion and pre-machine pre-history. I can write you a machine-friendly binary pulse barrage that both sounds really funky and has meaningful data within it if you run it as a program." [[color=purple]Must have AI citizens[/color]]

[6]. "The nation is you, dear leader, and you are the nation," reminds the biggest suck-up in the office. "An anthem should sing your praises and be entitled Ode To @@LEADER@@. We can work on the words and the tune later: the important thing is the subject matter." [[color=purple]Must have unlocked @@LEADER@@[/color]]

7. "We don't need subject matter to worry about or lyrics for the plebs to sing," chimes in snobby classical musician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, smacking your staffer's head with a flute. "We must create a modern masterpiece, a magnum opus that will raise @@NAME@@'s spirits, a musical composition to define our nation. Summon the nation's greatest composers and an orchestra of the finest musicians. We'll give you a National Symphony and an anthem that will last forever!"

8. "National anthem? Bah!" scoffs resident anarchist and constant thorn-in-your-side @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We don't need this government forcing that patriotic drivel down our throats! Besides, most @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are terrible singers! That's the last thing I want to hear at a football game!"

[b][anchor=634]#634[/anchor]: Bullet Time [Rubyna; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Regular traffic congestion within @@NAME@@'s interstate highways have resulted in a flurry of petitions being sent to you demanding the development of a Maglev bullet train connecting the nation's major cities. Apparently there was going to be a demonstration outside your front door as well, but the protesters got stuck in traffic.

The Debate
1. Moments before you are about to go home after a long day at work, an intruder intercepts you at your front door. His face is a deeper shade of red than the sunset outside your window. He yells at you: "Eight hours! Do you have any idea how it feels to sit in traffic for eight hours? Be quiet! How can I do good work when the commute takes the whole day? Listen, most other developed nations already have a high-speed, high-efficiency railway systems, and not having one is not doing us any favors, economically or for our mental health. We Need Bullet Trains! Give us Bullet Trains!"

[2]. "That angry fellow is correct, you know..." says @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, an agreeable businesswoman who gently guides the furious commuter to the back door, "but who is to say the burden of the cost should be on the government's back? Me and my colleagues in Budget Rail Incorporated can get @@NAME@@ high speed connections with no cost to your taxpayers. We've got suppliers of nearly-new metal, fairly decent quality second hand trains, engines that almost passed emission standards. We've even identified which arable land owners you'll need to force to sell to us to make this service fast and profitable. Just sign, quickly, here, here, here, and umm... initials here..." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3.  "You can't do it!" groans @@RANDOM_NAME@@, ecologically minded pop-musician with the recent #1 hit [i]I Hugged A Tree and I Liked It[/i]. "Mother Nature gives us love, and look at how we treat Her. We're binding her flesh with steel rails. I mean, forests, the trees, all that... they give us oxygen and stuff. Dodge the bullet, save the world!"

4. "Slow down, now. Slow down, all..." says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a villager visiting the capital for the first time. "More railways is a fine thing for all, but why have fancy high speed trains that zoom past all the interesting places on the way? I think you should be building a LOW speed rail, that stops at all the picturesque hamlets and towns, and brings visitors to them. Stop by Little Droppings - that's my own town, by the way - and I'll brew you a nice cup of tea."

[b][anchor=635]#635[/anchor]: Hey Kid, Have A Cigar [Kungyo; ed: Sleep and Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
One of @@NAME@@'s leading tobacco companies, Maxboro, has produced an advertisement depicting children frolicking in a playground while smoking cigars and cigarettes. Predictably, a truckload of angry letters has been dropped on your desk, from angry parents and moralising busy-bodies.

The Debate
1. "This is truly odious!" screeches @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, your Secretary of Political Correctness, as she tries to cover her child's eyes and ears. "Tobacco companies cannot be allowed to market their death-sticks to our children! Our poor vulnerable youngsters could get hooked, and become chain-smokers before they finish primary school! Advertising dangerous products to children must be banned!" 

*2. "Oh, Boo-hoo!" mocks M.B. Winston, CEO of Maxboro, while smoking a SpongeBarry SquareShirt themed cigarette. "Those ads are cute and funny! Kids should be allowed to make up their own minds about our exquisitely smooth leaf blends and candy-flavoured filters! Market restrictions are un-@@DEMONYM@@. We should be able sell our product to anyone who can afford to buy it, no matter how old they are!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "Oh, Boo-hoo!" mocks M.B. Winston, State Factory Director of Maxboro, while smoking an unfiltered cigarette with acrid fumes. "These advertisements remind children that by buying cigarettes, they are supporting the Motherland! You should, in fact, be encouraging this habit, with increased funding for state advertisements encouraging all good children to smoke." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "I have a reasonable third option!" interrupts passing minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, right around the time someone normally interjects with a crazy third option. "Let tobacco companies operate freely, but have them do social good equal to the social harm, according to a fair assessment of externalities. Like, if they advertise to children, then they have to build a kids clinic or a litter picking program, that sort of thing."

[b][anchor=636]#636[/anchor]: Going on the Cyber Offensive [Noahs Second Country; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A student was recently suspended by a school for posting negative comments about a fellow classmate on an online gossip column. The offensive message read [i]"@@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@'s dad is such a drunk, that he didn't just lose his front door keys, he lost his whole front door... and his house... and his job. Sucks to be his son, huh?"[/i]. As both the suspended student's parents are celebrities, there's been a lot of media coverage of the incident, and now everybody is talking about it. Some are calling this harmless fun, while others are labelling it as cyberbullying. It seems like everybody wants to know where you stand on this.

The Debate
1. "This is a complete violation of my rights," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the student in question. "I can say what I want outside of school, as long as I like, don't, like, harm anyone. Like, the whole free speech thing, you know. I wasn't in school, so they can't punish me. People just need to be allowed to say whatever. By the way, check out my latest roasting of this one geography teacher at my school who doesn't take showers."

2. "Schools need to be stricter," whispers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, worriedly looking around before nibbling on a bar of chocolate. "People used to use my name, but now I'm just 'Ugly Fat-Face'. Please, make it stop! Schools should strictly punish students who say rude things online."

*3. "Kids these days, they're geni.. geniei... uh... geniuses!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Solutions. "This is the best idea we've had in a while! With elections coming up, we can hire a few of these prodigies of the put-down, and pay them to work for us. The kids can, as they say, 'roast' the other politicians, and make you look great in comparison!" [[color=blue]Must have elections[/color]]

*4. "Kids these days, they're geni.. geniei... uh... geniuses!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Solutions. "This is the best idea we've had in a while! There's always demagogues, rebels and dissenters we need to put down. With your permission, perhaps we can put these children to work in slandering them. It's a subtler approach than a bullet to the head, killing the credibility of their ideas. The kids can, as they say, 'roast' the dissenters, and make you look great in comparison!" [[color=red]Must not have elections[/color]]

[b][anchor=637]#637[/anchor]: Little Pizza History [Oppressia FTDOF; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Prominent restaurant chain Pop's Eatery recently announced plans to tear down the historic Cash Mansion in @@CAPITAL@@ and replace it with a fast food restaurant. Disgusted by the impending destruction of a national landmark, two dozen history students have surrounded the site, delaying the building's demolition and causing just enough ruckus to get your attention.

The Debate
1. "We cannot accept this blatant destruction of our culture!" cries a surprisingly agile social studies teacher, leaping into your office window after scaling the side of the capitol building. "It's common knowledge that Douglas Cash was the leader of the revolutionaries that founded this country... or was he the inventor of that spinning doohickey? Either way, the Cash residence is a priceless piece of our national history. The government should protect the site as a national landmark... and put more funding towards historical education while you're at it."

2. "Out with the old and in with the new!" opines @@RANDOM_NAME@@, manager of Pop's Eatery, while handing out free samples to everyone in sight. "These fried saltballs were invented right here in @@NAME@@ by one of my top chefs, and at least in my opinion, that's some @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ culture worth celebrating. If you assign a few more cops to keep away the overeducated hooligans from my stores, then I could have a free hand to open Pop's Eateries on every corner of @@NAME@@."

3. "Why not have your cake and eat it too?" asks your underachieving Culture Minister, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while tucking into a tray of vol-au-vents taken from a recent gallery opening. "By which I mean have food AND culture at the same time. We should preserve these historical sites and allow - no, actually, make that REQUIRE - that they all have restaurants built within them. Imagine it: a roast on the spit in an old castle, tea and scones in noble palaces, all-you-can-eat-buffets in museums commemorating the Great @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Famine. Now that's what I call culture!"

[b][anchor=638]#638[/anchor]: Won't Somebody Think of the Children? [Niklaustan; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
On your way to work this morning, you noticed an unusually high number of orphans pickpocketing and 'asking for more' from passing strangers. Realizing that this may put a stain on @@NAME@@'s reputation, you have asked for opinions on how to deal with this orphan overcrowding problem.

The Debate
1. "Gawd bless youse, @@LEADER@@, but can't ya spare a copper or two for us poor little cherubs?" meekly asks an orphan known as Minuscule Max, who has managed to pick your pocket without you noticing. "The old orphanage is in a right sorry state, an' no mistake. Just yesterday we 'ad ta burn our caps and clogs to have somethin' to warm ourselves by. All we askin' is that you 'ave a think about us: maybe them fightin' soldiers could get less, and we could get more?"

2. "I agree that these children should not be left to fend for themselves, but let's not be too hasty about lowering military funding," reminds your semi-compassionate Minister of Defense who prefers to 'kill enemies kindly'. "In fact, why do we even need these orphanages? These children are sponging off the government's teat and all we get in return is a bloated welfare budget! All orphaned children should be sent to military training academies, and then they can repay us for our generosity by fighting for our glorious @@TYPE@@!"

[3]. "I can't believe what I'm hearing!" gasps factory manager @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Scrooge, whose remarkably clean hands have never known a day of honest labour. "How can we be sinking so low as to even consider wasting such a valuable resource on the military? I agree that we should get these kids off the government teat, but we should lower the working age so they can work and earn money to fend for themselves! Send these orphans to work in my factories and I'll pay them a very 'generous' wage." [[color=blue]Must not ban Private Industries[/color]]

4. "You know, I think our friends in Dàguó have the right idea with their one child policy," suggests population control expert @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while going over the latest birth statistics. "@@NAME@@ has a population of @@POPULATION@@ and growing. We can barely keep up as it is without adding orphans into the mix. I propose adopting Dàguó's one child policy here while offering generous tax incentives for the good people of Maljaratas to adopt our remaining orphans. It may be a tad restrictive, but the people will thank me when they aren't suffocating on the subway."

[b][anchor=639]#639[/anchor]: No Country For Old Men [Troperia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
After several incidents which resulted in the loss of millions of @@CURRENCY@@ have been discovered to be caused by senility and feebleness, concerned financial and medical professionals are wondering if retirement should be made mandatory at a certain age.

The Debate
1. "It's not really such a bad idea," suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your middle-aged medical adviser while checking your pulse to see if you're still alive. "You see, when some people reach a certain age, they become too weak and mentally incompetent to do their job. Therefore, we need to impose mandatory retirement so our nation wouldn't have to put up with things like that senile 95-year-old rickshaw driver who caused that day-long traffic jam on the highway. Of course, we mustn't be cruel: we should also provide better pensions for them so they'll be content in their dotage."

2. "Our age has nothing to do with the... uh... what was it... the wild @@ANIMAL@@ hybrids rampaging through @@CAPITAL@@!" states bumbling security guard @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who didn't hear the stampede of hybrids escaping the lab due to a malfunctioning hearing aid. "So you people think that just because we're old, we can't do our jobs? Well guess what? I've seen younger people who are more lazy, inefficient, and more... something than a sloth! Retirement and firing should be based on capabilities, not age!"

*3. "Why bother with retirement anyway?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a rather young basket weaving CEO whose employees consist mostly of @@HIS@@ aging relatives. "I mean, the only reason it exists is just so old people can laze around doing nothing, right? So why don't we remove it altogether and make it so that people have to work no matter how old they are? Sure, incidents like the that doctor who left his false teeth inside a patient might be more common than before; but that's the price you have to pay for the sake of productivity." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "Why bother with retirement anyway?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a rather young basket-weaving commune director, whose subordinate workers consist mostly of @@HIS@@ ageing relatives.
