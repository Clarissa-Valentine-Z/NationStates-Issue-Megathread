[b][anchor=1400]#1400[/anchor]: President No [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
You have called for a meeting in an attempt to resolve “the missile situation” without any further escalation.

The Issue
Surprisingly, the United Federation has accepted your request for a diplomatic summit. After a long flight, you have arrived in Granfalloon, the dusty and impoverished capital city of San Vitenzo. Several dignitaries are already waiting to speak with you.

The Debate
1. “Ah, the red menace has arrived!” smirks President Ken J. Finnedy, who was handing out miniature United Federation flags to the local residents. “The proud industrialists of the Federation stand united against warmongering commies like yourselves. Frankly, we’re tired of putting up with your capitalist-shaming calumny. I insist that you remove all of your nuclear missiles from this island and send them back to your own godforsaken country before you get into any worse trouble.”

2. “Let’s not start off on the wrong foot,” calls out San Vitenzo’s sandal-clad President for Life, “Doc” Moreno, as he walks up to you and pulls you aside. “The hard-working people of our nation need protection from the imperialists of the world who would take advantage of us. We certainly appreciate your generous support. However, these nuclear missiles have just turned us into a target. What if you and Finnedy were to each remove some of your weapons that were near the other party’s borders? If your missiles on this island were to disappear, I think I could talk Finnedy into removing all of his nukes from Eagleton Air Base — which I’m sure is too close to @@NAME@@ for comfort. Now... while you’re here, have you ever heard of boko-maru?” He looks at your feet and removes a tape measure from his pocket.

3. As you are about to return to your hotel room, a young woman approaches you and starts speaking rapidly. “Excuse me! My name is Ramona Moreno — President Moreno is my father. Papa is too proud to admit it, but our people are starving. Since he’ll never ask for it directly, I will: we need massive amounts of food and medical aid. You’re supposed to be our ally, but I get the feeling that you don’t care about our people; you’re just taking advantage of our location in case you need to launch missiles at the United Federation. Well, without your assistance, we’ll soon have to ask for help from the Federation — which means they will force us to adopt ‘free markets’ and sell off all of our limited resources at rock-bottom prices. Please negotiate a missile removal plan with my father — and then send us as much aid as you can afford.”

[b][anchor=1402]#1402[/anchor]: You Only Negotiate Twice[/b]

The Story So Far
You agreed to remove your missiles from San Vitenzo in exchange for the United Federation removing their missiles from Eagleton Air Base.

The Issue
After a series of secret negotiations, everyone has shaken hands and made a commitment to disarm. You and an aide have met with President Ken J. Finnedy in a beautiful glass-fronted conference room in San Vitenzo to sign the final agreement.

The Debate
1. “Good morning! Are you ready to make history? Let me just get my ceremonial signing pen.” Finnedy reaches into his coat pocket and removes not a pen, but a Smyth & Weston revolver, which he points directly at your chest. “Have you noticed that world leaders like ourselves never get frisked for weapons? I can’t remember the last time I had to go through a metal detector. Seems like a security flaw, don’t you think? Well, I digress. I hope you didn’t actually expect me to remove my own missiles. You see, I didn’t get to be President of the United Federation by giving up power every time I had a disagreement with someone. Real leaders do whatever it takes to seize power and claw our way to the top. Although I firmly believe that the only good commie is a dead commie, this isn’t personal — it’s just politics. As soon as you’re dead...” Suddenly, the window shatters as Natasha Milanova crashes into the room in a hail of glass fragments, closely followed by her @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ flag parachute. Milanova leaps toward Finnedy, kicks the revolver out of his hand, and slams him into the floor. “I hope you don’t mind me dropping in, Comrade Leader. Your aide pressed the panic button — and I see that mister Imperialist in Chief is up to his old tricks. Well, here’s how it’s going to go, Finnedy. I discovered your plans to send an armada to @@NAME@@ to bombard us. To prevent that from happening, I secretly removed a warhead from one of your nuclear missiles before it was loaded onto a submarine at Libertyville. I handed it off to one of my colleagues, who has hidden it in your capital city, ready for detonation at a moment’s notice. Either you sign that agreement and follow through with each of its terms, or your ‘glorious free-market paradise’ is going to be a victim of your own hubris. Are we clear?” Finnedy nods and quickly scribbles his name on the agreement. “Good. Now get out of here and don’t threaten @@NAE@@ ever again, or your capital will become a radioactive crater faster than you can say ‘hedge fund manager’.” Milanova turns toward you as Finnedy and his aide scurry out of the room. “Let’s go home, boss.”
