[b][anchor=1320]#1320[/anchor]: A Case of Poor Turnaround [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The @@ANIMAL@@ Room — a @@CAPITAL@@ nightclub known as a swinging hotspot — was recently the site of a tragic fire that started with a flaming sambuca shot and ended claiming the lives of hundreds. Fire investigators have attributed the high number of deaths to multiple causes, but most notably the large revolving door which was the only access to the premises, which panicked crowds jammed against as they tried to escape the blaze.

The Debate
1. "Imagine being pushed from behind, trying to get through a door which you know is unlocked, but which is providing no escape because of the mass of people trying to get through," narrates criminal legislator Melody Grove. "The simple solution? Doors that swing outwards. Every revolving door must either be flanked by or replaced by swing doors, and proper fire exits must be built into every building that is accessible to the public."

2. "Look, I'm sad, I'm super sad about that tragedy," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, manager of competing nightclub @@CAPITAL@@ Nights, as @@HE@@ pens a flyer for a Special Memorial Tribute Disco. "But do you really want all that bureaucracy putting a dampener on the whole nocturnal recreation industry? I tell you, all those dead party-goers would be spinning in their graves! Instead, step back and let the invisible hand of capitalism guide future fire safety measures. Customer choice and the laws of market competition will result in safer nightclubs, I guarantee it!"

3. "There's potentially a silver lining here to the black clouds of smoke around this situation," mentions your Minister of Surprises, popping up from behind a sofa. "A known dissident and vocal critic of your rule was amongst the dead. We should see this as a signpost to future opportunities. With a little surveillance of our political opponents' social habits, a little well-planned arson, and a few strategically locked doors... well, let's just say your problems will go up in smoke."

The Issue
A climbing jackpot in the lucrative @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ national lottery has led to weeks of media frenzy, and at last, a ticket sold at a corner drugstore in @@CAPITAL@@ has been drawn. However, the winner has refused to come forward to claim their prize. A letter sent without return address purports to be from the winner, who demands to remain anonymous.

The Debate
1. "This is a matter of privacy and safety," argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a spokesperson for the pro-anonymity group Citizens Railing Against Peeping. "Releasing the names of these winners puts them in considerable risk. Last month's winner was harassed by former partners, stalked by tireless panhandlers, and nearly robbed by half a dozen chuggers! Lottery winners need to be left alone so they can go back to their normal jobs — or not, as the case may be."

2. "We must continue to publicize these lucky winners," interjects your head of gaming, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while slipping on a pair of black leather gloves. "Our lotteries help fund important @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ programs like education, parks, and hacki- I mean technical literacy, so the people need to know the winners' identities to ensure it's not just government insiders who win. Plus," @@HE@@ continues while putting on a clown mask, "we're still a nation of laws. I'll concede that a few weirdos will stalk the winners, but the overwhelming majority of our citizens are courteous enough to leave them alone. Now where did I leave my lockpicking set?"

3. "Gambling is the Devil's vice!" proclaims puritan zealot @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Lotteries are a legal avenue for the state to rob the destitute and mathematically illiterate! I've spent millions of francs on tickets and haven't won a fraction of it back! You need to not just protect the winner, but all of @@NAME@@ — outlaw all forms of gambling immediately!"

The Issue
Last month, a prestigious @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ retirement home had a novel idea: combining aged care and kindergarten. The idea was well-received by geriatricians and geriatrics alike, and now participants are proposing the model be adopted across the care sector.

The Debate
1. "It wasn't just a frivolous idea," states trainee care home manager @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We attempted a trial run and monitored the subjects closely throughout. Every one of the elderly participants showed significant improvement in physical ability, mental health, and overall well-being. And the children learned valuable life lessons! Please @@LEADER@@, implement this model of care across @@NAME@@."

2. "Sure, the trials showed promise..." begins @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Science. "But only one 'class' of children took part, and a mere 20 seniors! How in Violet's name that's considered a scientific trial is beyond me. Expensive policy proposals need rigorous trials and extensive research before being implemented wide-scale. If the effects are as beneficial as its proponents claim, surely it bears further study?"

3. "You have got to be kidding!" replies kindergarten teacher Harold Weissenegger. "If you think my precious little kiddos are better off in a musty old folks' home, you're insane. No-one knows anything about what old Glynis or Ernest are like with children, and these kids won't be the experiment to find out! Youngsters belong in the classroom with structured, disciplined teaching — old people's homes should be for old people only."

4. "Yesterday, I had to change four patients in the space of half an hour," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an overworked carer from @@NAME@@ City Lakes, "And you want me to supervise children too? Nope. If you're going to put youngsters in retirement homes, they'll need to pull their weight. They can do all the dirty work, like changing soiled bed linen, while us qualified carers do the proper stuff! Maybe then I can finally catch a break." @@HE@@ breathes an audible sigh of relief

[b][anchor=1323]#1323[/anchor]: Toss the Coin? [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
A recent financial crisis has seen the currency of East Lebatuck plummet, making that nation a popular holiday destination for @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@. Some shrewd citizens have discovered that a one lira Lebatuckese coin, worth 0.25 of a @@CURRENCY@@, has exactly the same size and shape as a one @@CURRENCY@@ coin. Their similarity is fooling vending machines in @@NAME@@, giving an effective 75% discount to coin fraudsters.

The Debate
1. "If you allow this fraud to continue, I'll go bankrupt!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the owner of the Eckie-Cola Company, emptying @@HIS@@ pockets and scattering dozens of East Lebatuckese coins on your desk. "These marauders have come back from holiday and literally plundered our coin-operated vending machines. @@LEADER@@, you must mint new coins: make them bigger, smaller, rectangular, hexagonal — I don't care! Just make them different from these!"

2. "@@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ are the symbols of our national pride; you can't change them!" roars @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a cultural conservative whose clothes pre-date your rule. "If anything needs to be changed, it's them stupid East Lebatuckese coins that were minted to mimic and thus devalue our currency. Just tell those impertinent counterfeiters to alter their money, or else we will prohibit our citizens from travelling to their country. Let's see how well they'll fare without the tourism income we generate."

3. "No, no, no, you can't do that; tourism is precisely the solution to this problem," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a distraught holidaymaker who has just come back from East Lebatuck with shopping bags full of cheap watches and chocolate. "You must remember that the East Lebatuckese lira lost so much value because of their economic crisis, so we tourists are helping to support their economy. Thanks to us, over time, the East Lebatuckese lira will come to be as valuable as the @@CURRENCY@@ and the problem will simply dissipate. If you want to accelerate this process, you can make it easier for us to help them by abolishing duty on all goods bought from East Lebatuck."

[b][anchor=1324]#1324[/anchor]: Wrecked by Wrestling? [Voxija; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A little kid has accidentally broken @@HIS@@ classmate's spine imitating @@HIS@@ favorite wrestler Bulk Bogan's "@@ANIMAL@@ Tackle" move.

The Debate
1. "Ban wrestling!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, founder of the group People Opposed to Practically Everything, using @@HIS@@ sign to break your office window. "My deadbeat ex took my kids to a wrestling match once, and that was the worst thing that ever happened to them! They began beating up other kids on the playground — my little girl tried to bodyslam a teacher. She now says she wants to be called 'Saraya' instead of Paige, which is her real name and far more sensible. Outlaw this ritualised violence! Do it for the children."

2. "I'm THE BULK!" bellows Bulk Bogan, breaking a pre-weakened two-by-four on his own forehead. "You want to know what THE BULK thinks about all this? Only THE BULK can make these moves, but if you kids wanna learn these moves FOR REAL and FOR SAFE, then en... enr... bring them to the BULK BOGAN Academy for Little Wrestlers!"

3. "A school for wrestling? That's not what @@NAME@@ needs," says Kay Faybe, your Minister of Party Pooping. "All @@NAME@@ needs is an awareness program teaching people that professional wrestling is in fact fake. Then everyone would just stop complaining."

[b][anchor=1325]#1325[/anchor]: Having Faith in Communism [Sensorland; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
Joseph Rushev, the Chairman of the East Lebatuck Communist Party, has accused you of "betraying the ideals of communism" by imposing @@FAITH@@ on the populace of @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "How dare this heathen accuse us of such a thing!" thunders your Minister of Righteousness, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The teachings of @@FAITH@@ say riches are evil and that all people should help one another, and I think there's something about seizing the means of production in there too, probably. In fact, it's @@FAITH@@ that sustains socialism! Rushev is condemning his compatriots to an eternity of torment with this state atheism nonsense. I say we send missionaries to spread the word of @@FAITH@@ all around the socialist world, so our comrades can be just as enlightened as we are."

2. "@@FAITH@@ is an integral part of our national ideology, but perhaps Comrade Rushev has a point," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your ambassador to East Lebatuck. "We should stop officially mandating the worship of @@FAITH@@. Letting our comrades choose their own religious path will make them happier and more productive, and it'll promote unity with our fellow socialist nations."

3. "That doesn't go nearly far enough!" shouts Maxist-Lenyoist scholar @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Religion is a tool used by the powerful to oppress and control the proletariat! To achieve true equality under communism, we must do as Comrade Rushev has, and ban not just @@FAITH@@, but all religion from @@NAME@@! Just think how productive all those old temples and shrines will be as factories!"

4. "Heathens, the lot of you!" ejaculates televangelist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The pride of @@NAME@@ will be its downfall! Are we, as mere mortals, in any place to decide how wealth should be spread? Only Providence is wise and powerful enough to decide who should be extravagantly wealthy and who should be a beggar on the streets! Any attempts to promote 'equality' will only serve to incur divine wrath! Let the heavens choose who to reward and punish; abolish this heretical economic system at once!"

The Issue
Two missionaries have been arrested in the avowedly atheist hermit nation of West Fedoriah while supposedly on a sightseeing tour of the country. They stand accused of undermining the nation by proselytising on behalf of @@FAITH@@.

The Debate
1. "This is a clear and concerted effort to foment dissent against our glorious Republic," phones in the West Fedorian ambassador from his embassy, a repurposed bungalow on the outskirts of @@CAPITAL@@. "Our legal system is very clear on the penalties for such a heinous crime: twenty years hard labour in one of our reeducation camps. I imagine our President might be tempted to show some clemency in this case, were you to make an entirely voluntary donation to his chosen charity, the World Atheism Independently Funded Union."

2. "It's never been our policy to support this kind of reckless endeavor," sighs religious leader Ali Hyde. "Well, not for the last couple of hundred years at any rate. Look, while I appreciate the contributions these two have made to our faith, it seems clear to me this is a diplomatic matter, not a religious one. Why don't we leave them to their fate, and stop all future travel to West Fedoriah to dissuade any other wannabe proselytists?"

3. "These two holy missionaries are martyrs of the faith!" declares your Minister of Holy Wars. "Or at least they will be, after we carpet bomb the city where their prison is. We must show these West Fedorians that they can't mess with @@FAITH@@! You must agree: a crusade to convert them from atheism to the one true faith is the only way forward."

The Issue
A long-awaited undersea tunnel linking @@NAME@@ to the island nation of Albionia has been completed — and motorists are rejoicing, or would be — if it weren't for the fact that Albionia drives on the opposite side of the road. Whilst the changeover happens easily, foreign motorists arriving in @@NAME@@ sometimes get confused over which side to drive on, leading to an increase in accidents.

The Debate
1. "I've had a vision on how to solve this," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Transport Minister, as @@HE@@ places a name-tag holder around your neck. "We just need to erect more signage and road markings telling people to drive on the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ side of the road. This simple and economic measure will remind motorists which nation they are in, and the accidents will cease."

2. "These Albionians are a bunch of nincompoops and a few signs won't stop them from driving on the wrong side," complains traffic warden Winston Sanders, who's notorious for yelling at motorists. "I mean, I caught an Albionian going the wrong way around a roundabout. How do you even do that? Everyone knows that if you drive on the left side of the road, go clockwise, and if you drive on the right, go anti-clockwise. Signage won't help. We need to ban Albionians from driving here until they pass our driving test."

3. "I have the solution... again," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Creative Solutions, as @@HE@@ uses one of @@HIS@@ shoes as an impromptu drinks holder. "Why don't we just make all our roads one way? Then it doesn't matter which side of the road you drive on, nor which side the steering wheel is on. It only matters in which direction you travel."

[b][anchor=1328]#1328[/anchor]: Not-So-Friendly Fire [Baggieland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The invasion of Ausonia was supposed to be over by last Maxxmas. However, the Ishkurian army has found itself in a state of deadlock with the enemy. Many of your frontline generals are complaining about the lack of battle-readiness of your newest recruits, and reporting that they are panicking when under fire. To counter this, it has been suggested that Harmonic Empire should increase the intensity of live-fire training exercises.

The Debate
1. "This makes perfect sense to me," proclaims General Harris, setting up a line of toy soldiers on a map of the front-line, which is a safe 300 miles away. "Training should be more realistic, to make sure new recruits are ready for front-line battlefield conditions. This won't be risk free, of course, and we'd accept a training fatality rate of one percent. Actually... better make it two percent, just to be on the safe side. Better that than dying in the field, eh?"

2. "If you want better morale, the answer is not more dangerous training," opines a former social worker turned army lieutenant. "The answer is emotional support workers, a military culture open to talking about feelings, and support bundles for front line forces feeling the stress. We should be teaching our soldiers to admit to crying, and feeling scared. Everybody gets frightened sometimes!"

3. "There's a far simpler solution," states Major General Oliver, sending the lieutenant scurrying out of the room by firing a cap gun. "As soon as a new recruit signs on the dotted line, have the recruitment officer shoot him in the leg with a pistol, then the new recruit will know what being shot feels like. It will only take a couple of months to recover from a flesh wound, the same amount of time training takes. Then we can ship them off to the front-line, confident in the knowledge that they've already been through worse."

4. "It's not just the military that needs to be prepared," observes Brigadier van Straaten laconically. "At the moment, we're taking the fight to Ausonia. War has a propensity of turning up surprises, and maybe in a year or so Ausonia will be taking the fight to us. We also need to toughen up our civilians — get them used to bombs falling around them as well, so that they will become proficient at getting into shelters quickly, then carrying on with life after an air-raid. Start bombing our own towns and cities now!"

[b][anchor=1329]#1329[/anchor]: A Little Bit Short [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A recent exposé revealed that growth hormone therapy — an expensive treatment meant to help children who are producing little to no growth hormone on their own — is increasingly being prescribed to wealthy children who are just somewhat shorter than average.

The Debate
1. "I just want what's best for my little Timmy; what parent wouldn't?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME1@@, who appears to have bribed your guards into getting an unscheduled meeting with you. "Growth hormone therapy is completely safe and the best doctor money could buy said it was a medically valid treatment for my little Timmy, what with him being [i]two whole inches[/i] below normal. Whether or not Timmy gets hormone therapy is between his doctor, my accountant, and me, not the government."

*2. "Great!" sarcastically exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME1@@'s valet after @@HE@@ has walked out of the room. "One more way the rich get it better off than the poor. My kids are even shorter than his, but I could never afford this treatment. You have to level the playing field.

4. "This is insane," cries a voice whose origins you can't locate at first, until you look down and find the wee Dr. Bill Harford. "There's nothing wrong with being shorter than average, even way shorter than average. You can't call something a 'treatment' if there are no adverse health effects associated with the 'illness' it treats. Ban growth hormone therapy in all cases and teach @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to love each other no matter what their size."

5. "I agree that the government should assure no one feels inferior because of the hand nature dealt to them," asserts everyman Berger Harrison, who is so average as to be completely unidentifiable. "However, what we should be doing is manipulating the hormones of all children so that they all end up at exactly the same height. All men may not be created equal, but we can fix that."

The Issue
A former member of your cabinet has just been executed for masterminding a plot to assassinate you and take power. While most are now satisfied that the threat has been dealt with, one particularly paranoid adviser has raised the issue of the deceased's family.

The Debate
1. "These scoundrels are tainted by the crime of their kin," says one of your fervently loyal ministers, as @@HE@@ shows you information on the family along with their pictures. "Treachery runs in their blood and we must rip it out, root and stem. The only solution is to execute the entire family as well. If you don't, they will rise up and destroy us in revenge for what we did... It's better to be safe than sorry."

[2]. "I think executing them is a little bit extreme," counters your sister as she looks over the documents of the family. "If you're really that worried about them, you could always just put them in prison. It's more humane and it keeps potential threats out of the way." [[color=red]Must not ban prisons[/color]]

3. "Come on, what century are we living in?" inquires your niece as she gently brushes your hair with a pink My Little Horsey hairbrush. "Show some mercy and let them know that they are safe under your regime. This will show you as a merciful and compassionate ruler, and leniency may very well inspire loyalty in them. I'm sure this will alleviate any bitterness they feel about their loved one being killed."

4. "I'm not too sure about just letting them carry on with things as normal," says your perpetually suspicious Secret Police Chief. "Let them think they are in your good books, but keep a close eye on them for the rest of their lives. Constant surveillance will make sure they don't get up to anything seditious."

[b][anchor=1331]#1331[/anchor]: Warning, Fatigue [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A recent midnight explosion at the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ National Steelworks, which claimed nine lives and injured a dozen more, was found to be due to an easily fixable error. The blocked release valve that was responsible did have an alarm circuit attached to it, which was warning that there was a problem. However, this was overlooked by no less than five safety technicians who all claim not to have noticed the flashing red light. The scale of the industrial disaster that followed this error has led to a government investigation.

The Debate
1. "This is about fatigue on the job. I warned my bosses, but nobody listens to me for some reason," says Floor Technician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, in a whiny monotone voice that would be so easy to just tune out. "Shift work, antisocial hours and inadequate length of break times and so on and so forth. Oh, I could go on and on. Dangerous heavy industry should only be allowed to operate during normal daytime hours, with decently long paid breaks and good union representation."

2. "No no, the problem here is information overload from warning fatigue," claims Systems Engineer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, helpfully turning off your TV set, radio and mobile phone so you can focus on what he is saying. "There are three dozen flashing lights and buzzing alarms on the work station, and that's basically too many. What we need is a comprehensive review of all workplaces to reduce all this electronic distraction, and mandate that systems be simplified down to just the base essentials."

[3]. "Actually, the problem is the inclusion of systems that are fatiguable," warns roboticist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "By which I mean humans. Flesh is fallible - just ask my ex; he knows all about organic elements not being able to rise to the challenge. What you need is government subsidisation of machine systems, to replace the human component wherever possible. Again, just ask my ex." [[color=blue]Must have computers.[/color]]

The Issue
Attendance at last week's stoning in @@CAPITAL@@ Square was at a record low, as citizens decided instead to take a healthy walk, read self-improvement books, or merely exchange pleasantries with one another.

The Debate
1. "It ain't right!" gripes souvenir rock distributor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, gesturing to @@HIS@@ unwanted supplies of pointy rocks and bags of reinforced gravel. "Last week's stoning only had a boring old murderer — what punter's gonna waste high-grade silicates on them? Bring back the mafia kingpins! Chainsaw maniacs! Send the police out to hunt them down, from wherever they can find them. Now they're worth a good chunk of quartz, eh?"

2. "It's not the quality of targets that's the problem," opines your brother, tossing a stone at a nearby barn door, and missing. "It's that there aren't enough to go around. Stoning is a noble art, and you should show your appreciation with a steady stream of targets, be they petty thieves or jaywalkers. How else can I perfect my technique?"

3. "If you want these events to draw a crowd, there's no sense in everyone getting stoned," chortles rock fan @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "This needs to be a special occasion that lives long in the memories of all those young and old — well, except the victims. We need stadia, lights, loud music and audience participation!

The Issue
At a recent international summit in Brancaland, the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ delegation became violently ill. Brancalandian doctors say all of them were suffering withdrawal symptoms because they were addicted to the drugs in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ tap water.

The Debate
1. "It's really sad to see what these drugs have done to your people," quacks Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the Brancalandian Health Service. "One of your envoy's aides almost died of hyponatremia because she drank so much water trying to get high. And that's not even getting into long-term health effects for people that have been on these drugs their whole lives, or the developmental effects on Deep children. Please, you have to stop drugging your country's drinking water. We can help you organize a detox program."

2. "Who ever heard of getting sick from drinking too much water? And what kind of nonsense word is 'hyponatremia'?" comes the muffled voice of the aforementioned aide, sulking beneath a blanket in her hospital bed. "Everyone knows it's important to stay hydrated. I'm not addicted to anything, and it's obvious this is all just a cover story to hide the fact that someone poisoned us! We need to pull our diplomats out of Brancaland for their own safety and send those nasty Brancalandians a strongly worded letter!"

[b][anchor=1335]#1335[/anchor]: First-Class Warfare [Krusavich; ed: Altmer dominion and Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
A video surreptitiously filmed in the First Class cabin of government-owned Air @@NAME@@ has been leaked to the media. This clandestine footage shows a government official eating truffles while making unsavory comments regarding the supposed poverty and personal hygiene of passengers flying Economy Class.

The Debate
1. "Those insults are an absolute disgrace to the socialist ideals of @@NAME@@," sneers electrician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a passenger on the flight in question. "Having all us @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ divided, even just for air travel, only ends up hurting what we all fought so hard for in the Revolution. Sure, it starts with petty insults today, but it'll only escalate from here. After firing that official, you must make it your mission to tear down the walls of oppression once again. @@LEADER@@, I call upon you to unite all airline passengers into a single People's Class!"

2. "Come on, it was a joke!" stammers @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the bureaucrat responsible for the comment. "I wouldn't have said anything if I had known these people can't take even harmless banter. For Violet's sake, someone threw fancy cheese at me on the way here, the smelly kind! I'm no class traitor — I work hard and mostly pay my taxes, just like everyone else! If these people want to feel some more equity in the air, they can save their @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ for a better ticket like the rest of us. Less complaining and more working sounds like a socialist ideal too, if you ask me!"

3. "Perhaps a compromise is in order," chimes your Minister of Air Travel @@RANDOM_NAME@@, playing with a miniature jet. "Completely restructuring our airline system to a single travel class would be prohibitively expensive with little practical benefit. But the class divisions we have now do seem counter to our central planning objectives. I would suggest introducing a raffle system. Make all ticket prices a flat fee, and simply assign the seating at random. That way we maintain the spirit of equality and fairness, without any major new expenses. Sure, some people will still be flying high while the rest are cramped together — but at least now there's no one to point fingers at."

[b][anchor=1336]#1336[/anchor]: Take Good Care of My Baby [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The nation has affirmed a strong pro-life stance, with abortions illegal and the sanctity of unborn life held to be inviolable. As a result, many unwanted pregnancies have been carried to term, with a not-insignificant number of new mothers immediately giving up their children for adoption.

The Debate
1. "I'm sorry that I can't be there for the baby, but look, I'm not even an adult myself, and I'm just not ready to be a mum," sobs @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a fourteen-year-old girl who refused to even hold her son on the day he was born. "I was thirteen when I got pregnant. You can't say I made a proper consenting choice to have a baby! Your law forced me to carry him for nine months; now you can carry him right on out of here. Just pay for more foster carers, or get more people to adopt, or whatever. I don't care. I never wanted that baby and I don't need him ruining my life, so he's your problem now."

2. "For sure, we need to look after woebegone babies, but what babies really need is their parents," lectures Welfare Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, thrusting a photo of the newborn at the mother with an accusing sniff. "We need to invest in antenatal and postnatal classes to teach that parenthood is a joy, and perhaps offer tax incentives to nuclear families that stay together. Maybe also charge a mandatory upkeep fee to parents who abandon their children to social care. A child needs family structure, and we should be encouraging this as much as possible."

3. "Right, though allowing welfare to prop up failing families is part of the problem," adds childless conservative Rush Limpbough. "The state should not interfere in what happens to unwanted children. If there's no alternative but to raise a kid themselves, new parents will have to step up to the plate and get it done. If they can't manage, their extended families will step in. It's tough love, but at the end of it, you've got kids raised by their families, as nature intended."

[4]. “If they can’t manage, we have bigger problems,” intones John Smith, an unremarkable paper-pusher from the local Parental Licensing Office. “These people, licensed or not, should never have been parents. And, making matters worse, if they’re unlicensed, we’re out of options - they can’t abort, but taking their kids away puts us right back in square one. Not only do we need to tighten up the licensing process — investigate prospective licensees’ socioeconomic backgrounds and support networks, on top of their parenting knowledge — but we need to make the penalties for unlicensed childbearing significantly more punitive. That’ll discourage parents from ever avoiding our rules.” [[color=blue]Must have Parental Licensing[/color]]

[b][anchor=1337]#1337[/anchor]: Waste Not Want Not [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
With the nation recently affirming its pro-choice stance and guaranteeing women the freedom to terminate unwanted pregnancies, the question has risen about the proper disposal of the products of conception.

The Debate
1. "This is an untapped medical resource of considerable scientific value," explains @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, the Director of the @@NAME@@ Stem Cell Research Institute, urging you to look at an image depicting a life-sized zygote. "Life-saving research can and has been carried out using foetal material. For example, past experiments that gave us the polio vaccine. In the future, they may be part of the cure for neurodegenerative diseases and spinal cord injuries. Claim this resource for use in medical research, and new advances will surely follow."

2. "I understand that abortion is sometimes regrettably necessary, but these are still human remains that we're talking about here," argues funeral director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, glancing dolefully at @@LASTNAME_1@@. "The bereaved family should perhaps instead be given counsel on options for a dignified funeral service, and the importance of mourning the lost little life. This act will also help give sufficient weight to the act of ending an unborn life, and perhaps make people consider their family planning options more carefully in the future."

*3. "The way I see it, the thing is a product of my body," says proud abortion clinic regular and self-proclaimed 'expert laissez-faire economist' @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "[i]Ipso facto[/i], I retain ownership. If I want to sell the products of conception to a research institute or to some major national corporation that wants it for whatever purpose, then I have the absolute right to sell to the highest bidder. If I'd rather not, that's up to me too. That's the free market economy." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. "The way I see it, the thing is a product of my body," says proud abortion clinic regular and self-proclaimed 'supraequality expert' @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "[i]Ipso facto[/i], I reserve the right to decide whether I want to donate it to the greater good or not. In fact, the state should be giving me the option of exchanging my bodily property for an additional share of the common wealth, to give me an incentive to support state-led research schemes or state factories or whatever. After all, those who contribute more to society deserve a little something in return. [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

[b][anchor=1338]#1338[/anchor]: Slow and Stupid Is the Race [The Marsupial Illuminati; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
A book on race and intelligence written by a prominent, but controversial, geneticist has caused a mighty kerfuffle with its claim that some groups are naturally less intelligent than others.

The Debate
1. "Group differences in intelligence are purely environmental," argues @@RANDOM_NAMEMALE@@, an academic and Bigtopian immigrant, handing his well-tailored cashmere coat to your intern and adjusting his ascot tie. "Performance results on intelligence tests are influenced by test bias and stereotype threat. Wealthy people who are better educated have higher scores, while the necessitous with their poor nutrition never stand a chance. It has nothing to do with genetics. Give minorities better education and living standards and they'll catch up."

2. "I just said that poor educational performance reflects an underlying genetic cause, and that it's not because of any environmental factors," states the book's author, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ looks up 'necessitous' in a dictionary. "There have been observed differences between the average IQ scores of varying groups, which also show that these differences persist even after controlling for factors such as income. Throwing money at minorities doesn't help them; instead you should cut welfare for these people to motivate them to study harder and thus overcome their natural deficiencies. This is the only way to help them improve their station in life."

3. "What a load of drivel!" declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a Bigtopian supremacist, proudly displaying @@HIS@@ chunky gold 'Bigtopia Rulz' medallion for all to see. "The notion that Bigtopians are inferior to another group, especially @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, cannot be tolerated. These 'researchers' with their absurd ideas must not be given a platform. I demand that you burn their books and send them into exile."

[b][anchor=1339]#1339[/anchor]: AI Citizens Driving Change? [SherpDaWerp; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
After a series of car crashes in @@CAPITAL@@ this week, all involving traditional, flesh-and-blood @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, the AI citizens of @@NAME@@ are saying that organic fallibility makes humans naturally bad drivers.

The Debate
1. "We machines have faster reaction times, better processing speeds and more driving ability than any meatbag motorists," lectures artificial intelligence and motorbiker EVL-KN:EVL. "I'm not saying we shouldn't let humans sit behind the wheel, but they should have AI help next to them to take over in dangerous situations. Or you know, when they think the humans are driving in a way that is ill-judged. We're all good at different things — us machines are better at risk assessment, logic, and quick-thinking, while meatbags are better at... at... other things, I'm sure."

*2. "Hmm... I'm just not convinced," wonders IT security researcher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is wholly human. "There's been tests done with adversarial images, and it's just too easy to fool image recognition these days. The second someone puts a sticker on a road sign, we can't trust any AI to obey! In fact, to reduce the possibility of such a hack occurring, we should stop AI drivers from getting behind the wheel. It's for their own good!"

[4]. "You want fast reactions? I can give you fast reactions!" suggests a shady-looking Phisa Pharmaceuticals representative. "You should mandate that all human drivers take our product [i]Speedica[/i], an enhancement drug that improves reaction times. We also produce other drugs that can address the side effects, as [i]Speedica[/i] can sometimes make folk feel a little... uh... flaccid." [[color=purple]Must not have Autarky, TBC[/color]]
