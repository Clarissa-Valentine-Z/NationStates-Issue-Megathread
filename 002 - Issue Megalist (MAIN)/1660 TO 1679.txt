[b][anchor=1660]#1660[/anchor]: The Plight of the Doomscrollers [Western Balkania; ed: Kaschovia][/b]

The Issue
The rapid rise of short-form content consumption in @@NAME@@ has been marked by an alarming uptick in reports of academic deficiency, spiralling attention spans, and concerns about data privacy. A loose coalition of parents and educators are vehemently rallying against the impact that this highly addictive strain of entertainment is having and are petitioning for the government to take action.

The Debate
1. "This is the downfall of the next generation, I tell you... " pleads overprotective mother Kai Sims, clutching her eight-year-old son like a baby. "@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ kids are flunking school and have no interest in anything other than those mindless videos! Platforms like ShortTok, WhoTube Shorts, and Flipstagram Reals are rotting away the minds of our future citizens and turning them into zombies! The most sensible solution here is to outlaw them once and for all and get those kids outside again! Think of th— " She swats the child's hand away as he reaches for your secretary's phone.

2. An awkward teenager with facial blemishes and broccoli-shaped hair scrolls through ShortTok for 17 seconds before realizing where he is. After a moment, he mumbles, "Firstly, let us watch whatever we want. Like, dude, I thought this was a freedom-having nation. If you ban short videos, that would be going against our rights and freedoms, wouldn't it? Fourthly, ShortTok actually, like, educates and teaches people. School sucks, but these videos have... a bunch of infor... m... action. Check this one out." He mutters something truly unintelligible before taking off, bumping into several people on his way out.

3. "Just banning the apps that distribute short-form content is far too modest," scoffs Yggdrasil Academy history teacher Oprah Berlusconi, previously cautioned for physical misconduct against a student. "Why do these youngins even need them dastardly small-screen doohickies? Just look at what they've done to him! They're the root of all the decay with young people in this day and age. Those devices poison you when you're still blooming; they strangle you by the neck, take your attention and consciousness hostage, and rob you of your precious time on our nation's great, green pastures! Ban minors from using 'smart' devices altogether and put those who don't comply behind bars!"

4. "Listen, I really don't care what people watch, but I'm certainly wary of malicious foreign actors!" exclaims full-time conspiracist and part-time sixty-three-year-old Nigel Lincoln, waving mini @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ flags in your face. "D'ya wanna know who owns the parent company of the ever-so dubious ShortTok? That's right... Dàguó! Their 'privacy' policy is over seven-hundred pages long for a reason... so they can harvest the data of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizens who don't read it! Don't even get me started on that Flipstagram shmuck Karl Muckstaberg or whatever his name is... in my mind there's only one fitting solution: ban foreign social media apps completely and mandate the creation of fully @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ government run platforms, for the sake of the @@TYPE@@!"

[b][anchor=1661]#1661[/anchor]: Payback's a Witch [Kissinger-Monroe; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
In one of the wildest and least known districts of @@NAME@@, belief in magic is common. Whenever a rural villager needs an incantation to bring about personal success or a hex to destroy an enemy, there is always a witch to fulfill that need, provided payment is received. Some residents are claiming that they have been swindled by these witches, but efforts by local authorities to crack down on witchcraft have failed.

The Debate
1. The local mayor, Hobbes Stoughton, pleads, "People have been scammed by these so-called witches. I have tried to enforce civil justice, but the hags can't be seized and brought to answer for the hurt they do; as they threaten anybody who tries to apprehend them with curses. Our townsfolk believe in their powers and are afraid to do anything. On top of that, these women are running illegal businesses, earning untaxed income! Set up national tribunals and burn them at the stake!"

2. While sticking pins into an effigy of Mr. Stoughton and lighting it on fire, Fiolxhilde, Witch of the East, responds, "Do not forget... my spells are capable of both good and evil! I help the common folk with their problems, and I am very popular for it. But now the mayor has gotten together a few liars to say that they've been duped! It's just a ploy to snatch all I've earned! @@LEADER@@, I foresee you holding on to power for many more years, but only with my support. Encourage the public to turn to witches for help in their lives, and you'll see that my prophecies are never wrong. I accept payment in the form of gold bars and eyes of newt."

3. A man holding a long wand points it at the witch, declaring, "I myself was a victim of your crimes, you harpy. You once sold me a love potion that didn't work! But behold, I, Priaspuro, have immersed myself in the study of magick and am now the greatest wizard in @@NAME@@! @@LEADER@@, allow me to form a party of warlocks to make battle with the witches, mana a mana! With their confiscated riches, we can establish a board to regulate the black magic market and prevent these women from cheating us all. We shall call ourselves the Keepers of the Sacred Gate. Anybody would be able to practice magick as a profession, but he must pay his taxes and only perform approved tasks."

[b][anchor=1662]#1662[/anchor]: Divine Dining [Frieden-und freudenland; ed: Klaus Devestatorie][/b]

The Issue
The annual feast day of the Bluebark tribe, Azure Wednesday, is fast approaching. The festival calls for the communal consumption of @@ANIMAL@@ stew as a re-enactment of the myth wherein Azura, the ancestral goddess of the tribe, bestowed the Earth upon humanity after defeating and devouring a celestial @@ANIMAL@@. Consumption of @@ANIMAL@@ meat is prohibited in @@NAME@@, but sources report that the Bluebark tribe has never stopped hunting @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ for Azure Wednesday.

The Debate
1. "Will somebody PLEASE think of the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@?" clamours @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a member of the @@CAPITAL@@ Nature Conservationists' Association, wearing a jacket covered in @@ANIMAL@@-themed enamel pins. "With all due respect, any mythology the Bluebark tribe has attached to our national animal is beside the point — our @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ deserve a place in our hearts, not our stomachs! We need a special police task force to track down these butchers and punish them!"

2. "Respect our great-great-great-great-grandmother Azura, the creator and eternal protector of our blue-tinted mountains!" chants Chieftain @@RANDOM_NAME@@, swinging an incense burner puffing cerulean smoke. "What happened to the values of tribal freedom and tolerance in this country? Azure Wednesday is one of our most important holidays, and banning us from sacrificing @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ on this day means disrespect and disdain for our ancient traditions. The consumption of @@ANIMAL@@ meat for ritual worship must be permitted."

3. "MURDER!" shrieks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a bovine psychiatry student at @@CAPITAL@@ University, carrying a cardboard protest sign covered in text too small to read. "Why do we only care about @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@? Untold thousands of innocent creatures are slaughtered every day to please the bottomless appetite of the human virus! If you're for real about caring for the well-being of animals, release every farm animal from their cages and fields! It's time to make this country completely vegetarian!" [[color=red]Must not have compulsory vegetarianism[/color]]

4. "All this drama just serves to confirm that religion is stupid," declares podcaster @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Are we genuinely expected to tolerate their belief that the world was dominated by @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@, and that a so-called 'goddess' killed and ate them, and then gave the world to us? Yeah, sure. If anyone in our government ever feels like using logic and reason for once, we should ban all religions, tribal or not, and put an end to this madness."

[b][anchor=1663]#1663[/anchor]: It's All in the Cards [GeodesicDragon; ed: Baggieland, USS Monitor, The Ankhalic Vaspriot][/b]

The Issue
A trading card game portraying the various nations of the multiverse — @@NAME@@ being among them — has become the latest craze in schools across the country. However, some parents and teachers are claiming it has a bad influence on children.

The Debate
1. "This game may seem harmless, but children are buying and selling these cards when they are supposed to be learning," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a concerned parent who has been campaigning against the card game. "It's a huge distraction, and the cards are stacked against children from less affluent families who are being bullied for not having the rarest cards. Just the other day, I caught my son going through my purse, and when I questioned him he mumbled something about 'farming those legendaries' and stormed off to his room. This game is turning our children into thieves and addicts, and I urge you to ban it immediately!"

2. "You can't!" exclaims schoolteacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, fanning @@HIM@@self with a large wad of confiscated cards. "These cards are excellent for teaching kids negotiation skills and the value of a good trade. Plus, you can make bank if you know how to play your cards right. Sure, some of us may spend hours a day opening packs, and sure, most of the cards are just junk, but you shouldn't punish everyone just because of a few deflated egos. In fact, why don't you publicly endorse this game? Oh, and if you know anyone who has a first edition Blackacre, send them my way."

3. "Y'know, these cards contain a lot of information," exclaims Corporal @@RANDOM_NAME@@ from the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Intelligence Service. "For instance, this Brancaland card says that their top export is maple syrup. So, if we ever need leverage, we can hit 'em with sanctions on maple products and topple their economy like a house of cards — it's warfare on a whole new level! If we buy the entire set, we'll have an ace up our sleeve for each of our potential future enemies. Transfer some cash to my department and we can start dealing ourselves some good hands!"

[b][anchor=1664]#1664[/anchor]: Hey Alexis, Are You Sexist? [Clever Homo Sapiens; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A study from the @@NAME@@ Institute of Technology claims that the use of feminine-sounding voice assistants reinforces gender bias, due to the inherent servility of such devices.

The Debate
1. "Are you really going to let this systemic misogyny continue, @@LEADER@@?" snaps Heidi Miller, the proudly feminist author of the study in question. "We're teaching an entire generation that females should be obedient, and only speak when spoken to. Voice assistants being female by convention renders even egalitarian users somewhat sexist, and reinforces the biases of true misogynists. The solution here is to mandate that voice assistants are assigned a random default gender upon activation, with an on screen pop-up warning of the risk of subconscious misogyny if they try to change a male voice to a female one."

[2]. "We're simply fulfilling the nation's desires," protests Sunderland Pikachu, a tech CEO notable for not being in the news on a regular basis. "Test groups of both men and women showed a preference for voice assistants to be submissive and feminine. Who am I to deny them their right to enjoy my software? There's even an option to switch to a male version, though nobody seems to use it. Luckily for you, I have an even better solution. As AI assistants are linked to HeMail accounts, we can use collected data to generate a voice and identity that we think an individual user will most enjoy, so a feminist like Heidi will automatically get a submissive male voice. We just need you to loosen some privacy laws so we can give the language model extra data points." [[color=purple]Must be Capitalist[/color]]

[3]. "It is only capitalist bias that says the female voice is submissive," protests your State Director of AI Rita Rechevoy, who reminds you a little of one of your scarier aunties. "We selected the female voice to give more authority. Feedback has been noted though. Say no more: we will adjust the artificial voice to make her more assertive and dominating. This matter is closed, you may go now, @@LEADER@@." [[color=purple]Must be Socialist[/color]]

[b][anchor=1665]#1665[/anchor]: The Relationship Is Complex-Cated [Stevist Guam; ed: Raionitu][/b]

The Issue
Last night, a prominent scholar from @@CAPITAL@@ University made a harrowing speech about the dangers of the "military-industrial complex," arguing that the influential arms manufacturing industry in @@NAME@@ makes it inherently more likely for the nation to pursue bellicose foreign policies. Now, as you start to enjoy a peaceful, serene day at @@ANIMAL@@ Park, you find yourself surrounded by a pack of alarmed political scientists armed with stacks of scholarship about the subject.

The Debate
1. "If you follow the money, @@LEADER@@, you're going to be sleepwalking into conflict," lectures wide-eyed political scientist Dr. Bruno Strange as he drops a thick reading list of history books by your side. "We have to control the military-industrial complex, or the military-industrial complex is going to control us! You should cap weapons procurement, implement annual military audits, and forbid government workers from having conflicts of interest with prominent arms manufacturers. In place of force, you can have us political scientists negotiate deals on your behalf."

*2. "Don't worry about it!" yells a jogger wearing suspiciously pricey-looking athletic attire as she comes to a screeching halt in front of the ring of academics. "The name's Harley Bush, CEO of @@NAME@@ Arms Inc. Anyways, what's really important is the threat that East Lebatuck poses to us! Really, you should be outfitting a whole new battalion, and wouldn't you know it my company just released a new line of body armor; after all, the best way to prevent war is to be extremely prepared for it, right?" [[color=purple]Must be Capitalist[/color]]

3. "You know, as long as we have a military, we have a government institution that is going to be pushing for conflicts," calmly interjects hipster Macca Hendrikson without looking up from a series of gentle yoga exercises. "Free your mind from all temptations. I'm reminded of an ancient proverb: 'to get self-control, push for radical arms control.' You should abolish the military, my friend. No military, no temptation to seek out conflict."

*4. "Don't worry about it!" yells a jogger wearing a government tracksuit as she comes to a screeching halt in front of the ring of academics. "The name's Georgina Zimmer, I work as a clerk in the army's arms acquisition department. Forget those scientists; what do they know about the world outside the classroom? What's really important is the threat the United Federation poses to us! Really, you need to expand our military's means of production; after all, the best way to prevent war is to be extremely prepared for it!" [[color=purple]Must be Socialist[/color]]

**5. "Don't worry about it!" yells a jogger, who is inexplicably carrying a manila folder stamped with a military emblem, as he comes to a screeching halt in front of the ring of academics.

[b][anchor=1666]#1666[/anchor]: The Balls in Your Court [Kissinger-Monroe; ed: Varanius][/b]

The Issue
The King and Queen of the Duumvirate of Oudeisorkhis are in @@CAPITAL@@ today for their state visit to @@NAME@@. The royal couple are accompanied by a strange retinue — a stream of eunuchs, said to be very loyal and capable. Spirited discussion has broken out at the state dinner about the supposed merits of such personnel.

The Debate
1. "Ah yes, my whole household is composed of such docile domestics!" explains King Kandaules, waving one of his ministers over. "As you can see, not only the servants, but even the highest officials in my imperial administration, my trusted viziers and councilors, are eunuchs. Unable to have children of their own, they have no appetite for self-aggrandizement and are thus able to devote all their passions to the state. Plant these seeds in your court, @@LEADER@@, and it will bear fruit."

2. "Ignore my beloved, he can be quite the oddball," states Queen Farinella, swatting her husband. "@@LEADER@@, there are far more graceful and elegant uses for eunuchs than the dirty business of governing. It may sound bizarre, but they make marvelous music. Hear me out. Our castrati, rendered eunuchs as children, retain their angelic voices and produce the most dulcet tones in our court. Our balls are always the best!"

3. One of your head servants quickly interjects: "I think not, buster! @@LEADER@@, it was clearly a mistake to invite these vulgar savages here. Castration is a barbaric and inhumane practice, only performed within the domain of despots. Nothing good comes from such mutilation! I suggest cutting this dinner short, and severing relations with any who refuse to drop the practice."

4. Graznys, one of your generals who is seated by you, whispers, "@@LEADER@@, these foreigners have just given me the idea for a new soldier. We should implement forced conscription for the children of certain undesirable groups within our population. These children would be castrated, rendering them obedient. They will grow to be the perfect soldiers after years of ruthless training."

The Issue
In anticipation of an upcoming favourable planetary alignment, scientists at the nation's space program are planning a mission which will eventually leave the solar system entirely. Because of this, some of them have suggested that the probe should carry a time capsule representing humanity in case it gets intercepted by extraterrestrial intelligence.

The Debate
1. "This is an out-of-this-world opportunity!" exclaims prominent astronomer Karl Ceylon. "This is our chance to toss a message in a bottle into a cosmic ocean for whoever may find it, however far in space or time they may be. Send them engravings of our solar system, our anatomy, and our place in the universe. If there's really anyone out there, the least we can do is say hello."

2. "Out of this world? You're out of your mind!" bellows @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a mercurial general whose presence seems to compel people to start doing push-ups. "If there's anyone out there, they need to know about passion, patriotism, and propaganda. Send images demonstrating the limitless amazingness of you, the GLORIOUS @@LEADER@@, whose power is as infinite as the universe. For example, how about you front and centre, glowing rays around you, with people lying prostrate to your glory?"

*3. "Sirius-ly? No space at the table for adverti- I mean, the interests of the free market?" interjects Udon Tusk, the CEO of a nebulous series of tech startups, who tends to gravitate towards your meetings whenever his projects fail. "Our propensity for innovation is matched only by our competitive spirit. Sell space in the time capsule to the highest bidders, and the magic of the free market will fill it with publicity stu- inventions that will show the universe our advancement. Plus, you could use the revenue to bail out m- I mean, subsidize further innovation." [[color=blue]Must have Private Industry[/color]]

*4. "Sirius-ly? No space at the table for the workers?" interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an ardent Party member who spends more time reading theory than doing @@HIS@@ job. "The human capacity for selflessness and solidarity should be reflected in the time capsule. Send the works of our greatest socialist thinkers, and we can sow the seeds of class consciousness across the universe! With my stellar expertise, I can make the selections." [[color=red]Must not have Private Industry[/color]]

5. "Why send something to represent humanity when we can send humanity?" postulates @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a scientist infamous for @@HIS@@ obsessive fascination with liquid nitrogen. "The probe should carry a cryogenically frozen brain. That way, any sufficiently advanced lifeforms that come across it would have access to the full cornucopia of human thought and emotion. Our message to the cosmos should be a testament to both our passion and our plight, our laughter and our lament, and, fundamentally, what it really means to be human. I volunteer my own brain for the endeavour. Death on Earth is merely the price of immortality among the stars."

6. "Shhh, they'll hear us," mumbles a barely audible voice, the source of which you can't pinpoint. "It's like a dark forest out there. If they hear us, they'll come for us. End the space program, and make sure we stay very, very quiet." You catch a fleeting movement in the corner of the room, but it vanishes as quickly as it appeared.

[b][anchor=1668]#1668[/anchor]: Can't-abrigian, Ox-no-nian [Helaw; ed: The Ankhalic Vaspriot][/b]

The Issue
Numerous unsuccessful applicants and watchdog organisations have accused several of @@NAME@@'s most prestigious universities of having discriminatory criteria and biases when assessing applications after multiple of them failed to admit a single applicant over the age of 65.

The Debate
1. "My, my, dearie! How disgraceful of these universities!" remarks Boris Humperdink, an elderly and unsuccessful @@CAPITAL@@ University applicant, while knitting you a sweater. "My tax @@CURRENCY@@ help fund these universities via government grants, so their admission criteria should be in full compliance with a comprehensive package of anti-discrimination laws. Establish an agency to audit every university and ensure that their admissions staff are held responsible for such overt ageism, with massive fines for all offenders. The press you'd get from removing these systemic barriers would look almost as good on you as these wonderful colours!"

2. "That doesn't go far enough!" proclaims local college student Gretel Pond, ripping various university insignias in two. "Universities shouldn't be giving any thought to anything other than academic capability. I've achieved the highest grades possible my whole life, yet these elitist universities are prioritising privately educated jocks and legacies with grades half as good as mine because their daddies can afford to bribe them with donations! Universities should be forced to take a top-down approach and only offer places to those with the greatest academic merit."

3. "This coincidence is simply a product of broader @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ society," states Lucius Wickwire, an admissions tutor for @@CAPITAL@@ University. "That our most successful applicants have similar characteristics and are of a certain sort is not due to bias in any institution, but rather those applicants being more likely to submit stronger applications. Additionally, we evaluate candidates in myriad ways that cannot always be publicised, such as whether they would fit into the social atmosphere of our institution. The government should respect universities' discretion so we can best broaden our horizons."

4. "It's definitely a systemic problem, but there's a proper solution," rebukes your Minister of Equality, twiddling his alumni ring. "There's a wider issue of prestigious universities like Maxford and Cambarry accepting more applicants from certain backgrounds due to imbalanced educational opportunities. Therefore, we should be looking to improve the quality of education available to these groups by building new schools and facilities specifically for them, such as schools preparing elderly people for returning to education. By improving the standard of our public schools, everyone can be given a fair and fighting chance at being accepted into their dream school."

5. "Do the right thing, @@LEADER@@," announces your Minister of Education, orating from atop a box they dragged into your office. "It is the right of every @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ to receive the best quality higher education possible and access the full extent of human knowledge. You must do away with this concept of 'best' universities by making sure every institution has sufficient funding to provide what is now an 'elite' education. It may be expensive, but it will catapult @@NAME@@ into the highest echelons of educational prowess and spawn innumerable advancements that will benefit every one of us in the long run."

[b][anchor=1669]#1669[/anchor]: They're All the Same to Me [Kilogramonia; ed: Raionitu][/b]

The Issue
Concerns have been raised about the upcoming election after a poll found that fewer than half of voters can name a single candidate on the ballot.

The Debate
1. "This is dreadful!" shrieks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Intelligence. "Democracy crumbles without an educated populace. Why, I've seen voters breaking into tears because the ballots use words that are too long! Learning about politics cannot stop when a child leaves school. You must mandate citizenship lessons to keep everyone informed on current affairs; anyone who can't pass a basic civics test shouldn't be allowed to vote! I'm sure we can find impartial people who can teach these things without bias."

2. "WHAT?!" bellows the opposition leader, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has been listening through the keyhole. "This is a blatant attempt to manipulate the election and make excuses for state-sponsored indoctrination! It is the unalienable right of all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to be as uneducated as they want, and to vote how they want, even if it's with their heads in the sand. Besides, the people don't really need to know about that one scandal. Let citizens make their choices, no matter how uneducated. Democracy should not be tampered with."

3. "As usual, TV has all the answers," your uncle sighs wisely. "Just turn news programs into competitions. Every hour a trivia question is asked about current events and a random caller with the correct answer wins. Everyone will be glued to the screen to try and win the jackpot, and they'll learn at the same time; you win, they win, everyone wins! Now move out of the way, I can't see the screen."

4. "Of course, you could always capitalize on a moment like this," whispers @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of your political party, who is polling last in @@HIS@@ upcoming election. "Clearly the people can't be trusted to decide their own fate, so why not just cancel the election and choose who's in the government yourself? You can always tell everyone you'll bring back elections once you've fixed the education system, say in a year, or two, or maybe a few more…?"

*5. "Clearly the problem is that voting is mandatory," states political commentator @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while flipping through charts of polling data. "Politicians aren't trying to do anything remarkable because they know citizens have to show up to the poll. Make voting optional, then only people who care will show up to elections, and only vote for candidates who put in the effort to get their name out there." [[color=blue]Voting is mandatory[/color]]

*6. "Clearly the problem is that voting is optional," states political commentator @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while flipping through charts of polling data. "Politicians aren't trying to do anything remarkable because they know only people who already have a political party will show up to elections. Make voting mandatory, then people will have to pay attention to who's on the ballet, and they'll only vote for candidates who put in the effort to get their name out there."

[b][anchor=1670]#1670[/anchor]: Bad Religion [Umbratellus; ed:  Klaus Devestatorie][/b]

The Issue 
In between body-racking sobs, your brother stammers out, "...and then my youngest, she — she asked me, 'Daddy, does God love me?' I don't know where she could have gotten such a sick notion in her head! We've — you've got to find out who's corrupting the minds of our children and putting religious ideas like this in their heads, and put a stop to it!"

The Debate
1. "Look around. Look around!" proclaims radical futurist Umberto Broccoli. "Everywhere we see, our frescos and façades, the statues in our streets, the poems on our parchments, they all bear the indelible stain of religion and uphold the irrational! All your niece might have done is visit any gallery or public avenue to see pieces by the so-called 'great masters,' and the gods and old ruling order they upheld." Lighting a priceless Da Finci painting on fire, he roars, "It's time to abolish it all! Bulldoze the museums, smash their sculptures, sack the libraries filled with their archaic screeds — their stranglehold on the arts must be ended once and for all!"

2. "Alas, the sad truth is," muses the newly appointed National Philosopher Max Togaspierre, "she may well have learned such foolish notions from those who meant best for her; one of her instructors might well have asked her to recite the days of the week: Thor'sday, perhaps?" Loudly slapping an out-of-date calendar on the wall, he continues, "look, even the length of the week reflects some ancient creation myth! There should be a much more logical system of horology: base-ten perhaps? It's high time we purge the sciences of every trace of the rotten remnants of religion!"

3. Slamming his fist on a table, atheist hardliner Jakob Hubert begins a furious rant. "It's not the paintings or postulations of dead men that are poisoning the minds of our children, it's the LIVING! The DAMNABLE, GOD-FEARING LIVING! Even now the twisted faithful ferret their sickening tomes in secret places, and practice their wretched rites in the shadows! For all we know they could have left some putrid pamphlet that your niece stumbled across in public! We must turn the full surveillance capabilities of the state against this cancer. Every man, woman, or child we even suspect of harbouring irrational belief should be brought in for 'interrogation', and when we uncover some unsanctioned ceremony, we BURN EVERY FILTHY CONGREGANT AT THE STAKE!"

4. TBD

5. A mysterious robed figure waves a dismissive hand. "The child is simple, she merely craves the comforts that religion once offered the people; community, structure, systemization of the world around them. We must offer our own enlightened alternative — secular and rational cults! We can take the old shuttered churches and cathedrals and consecrate them as Temples of Reason! The streets will reverberate with mantras of supreme atheist logic! At every corner we will proclaim a euphoric new dogma of our truth and liberty!"
