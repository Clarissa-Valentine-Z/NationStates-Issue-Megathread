[b][anchor=640]#640[/anchor]: A Clear-Cut Conundrum [Mount Seymour; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
The Shepherds of the Forest - a particularly dedicated section of the The Ramblers' and Hikers' Association - have just completed a long march from the remote Western @@ANIMAL@@ Mountains National Park to @@CAPITAL@@. They come bearing news that elements within the Timber Woodchipping industry have been covertly logging the protected area for over a decade without the government even noticing.

The Debate
1. "I was just hiking quietly along the back of Grand @@ANIMAL@@ Ridge," recounts @@RANDOMNAME@@, a very sturdy forestry professor, with a tall head and hardly any neck. "I rounded a bend and there before me lay the most horrendous sight I ever laid eyes upon. Stands upon stands of trees, butchered like on a battlefield, many of whom were my friends. There is no curse in the tongue of @@NAME@@ for this treachery. O please, @@LEADER@@, make the destroyers who did this replant all the trees they massacred, and stop them from ever coming back!"

2. "Bah, humbug," bellows @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, a sour man representing one of the rogue logging companies, draped in a robe of many colors. "That Western Whatever Park is so far away that no one even goes there anyway, except for those weirdo hikeaholics. Our great and glorious @@TYPE@@ would be best served by burning that old world in the fires of industry. Auction them all off to the highest bidder, foreign or domestic! Forests will fall and @@NAME@@ will make profits you've never dreamed of. Just imagine it."

3. "HOW DARE THEY!" screeches @@RANDOMNAME@@, a self-professed eco-warrior, wielding an elaborately carved battle staff made out of the highly endangered @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ pine. "These evil corporate schemers, planning to destroy the world just to gain wealth! The only way we can keep our parks safe is by allowing not a single person - yes, you heard me - not a single person into them. They need to be off-limits to the inherently greedy, destructive natural tendencies of humans. @@LEADER@@, let me raise a posse of good and green men to guard our forests and bring the sword to any desecrating capitalist pig who dares enter."

[b][anchor=641]#641[/anchor]: Dirty Little Minds [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
The Health Ministry has expressed serious concerns at new evidence that pollutants in the atmosphere and water supply may be negatively affecting the intelligence and cognitive abilities of the nation’s children.

The Debate
1. “Legislation is the answer,” declares tatty-suited progressive @@RANDOMNAME@@ in the middle of a two-hour slideshow on rainfall. “Crack down on air pollution, regulate vehicle emissions, and heavily tax polluting industry and power generation. The economy may experience a short-term loss, but that sacrifice is worth it for our children’s long-term cognitive function.”

2. “Self-regulation is the answer,” says expensively dressed lawyer @@RANDOMNAME@@, who just finished another fraud trial. “The industry will... uh... establish a voluntary code of conduct, and we will definitely think about cutting into our profit margins and reneging on our obligations to our shareholders to make a fast buck. At the very least, we’ll do some great PR work. And kids getting dumber? Well, I should point out that a dumb populace is a free-spending and unquestioning populace: that sort of thing is great for the economy.”

3. “Science is the answer,” opines overzealous transhumanist @@RANDOMNAME@@, whose clothes are so metallic and futuristic they just look silly. “The problem here is that we’ve got the wrong sort of pollutants. Add the right neuro-stimulant chemicals to the waterways and the air, and I can guarantee you the lovely pollution will start making our kids harder, better, faster, stronger. Sure, they might have increased risk of fatal brain hemorrhage in puberty, but they’ll expand their cognition and consciousness and become Human Plus.”

4. “Creative thinking is the answer,” schemes an intimidating ‘solutions manager,’ @@RANDOMNAME@@. “We can keep making pollutants, so long as we don’t let them get into our nation’s environment. I’ve got half a dozen amazing ideas, from selling our waste to gullible third world nations as fertilizers, to sticking some of the nastier chemicals into a newly rebranded ‘smokey-cola’ and pushing it to export. All extra sludge can just be dumped at sea - far, far away from @@NAME@@. Recategorize waste as product, and we can get it out of the country at a nice profit.”

[b][anchor=642]#642[/anchor]: This Way's Kinder [Uberreichland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
[b]Hail to you! Hail @@LEADER@@![/b] Patriotism and love for your government is (naturally) on the rise, and one of your closest advisors has suggested to you that @@NAME@@ forms a youth organisation to teach the next generation to love you as much as this one does.

The Debate
1. “Think about it!” says sycophantic Party Coordinator @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, with remnants of silly string and party streamers on his dress uniform suggesting he has perhaps misunderstood his job title. He stands by you on the palace balcony, gesturing to indicate a group of serious-looking children saluting a giant flag. “The patriotism in these kids is admirable! Give them an official youth organisation in the name of our righteous ideology, and call it [i]The Children Of @@LEADER@@[/i]! Teach them to sing songs, to swear allegiance to the flag, to camp in the wilderness, maybe how to clean and shoot a rifle. Who knows when a group of wonderfully fit, patriotic boys could come in handy?”

2. “Obviously managing the nation’s youth is sensible, but training and arming them sounds a little incautious,” suggests Security Director @@RANDOMNAME@@. “Teach them to obey, for sure, but put them to work doing socially useful tasks instead: road building, stone breaking, window cleaning, that sort of thing. Childish high spirits are something to be broken, not encouraged.”

3. “What have the schools been teaching my son?” yells angry mother @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@ as she drags her spotty teenage sprog into your office. As your guards attempt to remove her, she employs some impressive ju-jitsu to send them flying. “He has turned into an obsessed robot, with more respect for @@LEADER@@ than for his own parents! I will not let my son join an organisation for brainwashed punks! I will not let you do this to anybody’s children! We, the people, say no to state-directed youth organisations!”

[b][anchor=643]#643[/anchor]: No Small Wonder [Henuld; ed:  Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
With economic growth skyrocketing and @@NAME@@'s prosperity rising, prominent business leaders have come to you with proposals to construct a national wonder as a symbol of these successes.

The Debate
1. “To mark this golden age,” declares Leo Tallstoy, CEO of Sky High Company, sitting upright with high hopes, “I suggest we build the tallest building in @@REGION@@! Not only can we finally snatch that tallest building record from the United Federation, but it will break whatever doubts our citizens have about @@NAME@@’s future! It will boost the economy and will be a good source of morale and patriotism. When aiming high, nothing’s worth the sky!”

2. “Why not aim just slightly higher?” asks Anais Skywalker, CEO of Colossal Works Industries, while putting an arm around your shoulder and pointing to a hole in your ceiling you hadn’t noticed previously. “Instead of the conventional skyscraper, we could build a space elevator? We have enough money, resources, and initiative to make sure our @@TYPE@@ is the first to develop one! We’ll need to overcome some tricky technical challenges, but such is the burden of the true pioneer! It’ll benefit us in space exploration, and that will serve to strengthen the legacy of our golden age!”

3.“Have you ever heard of the saying ‘too tall to fall?’” inquires Hugh Mongo, another CEO of a large construction company, who barely fits through your doorway. “Or was it ‘too big to fail?’ Anyway, I think that the answer to mark @@NAME@@ successes is not with something tall, but great. And by great, I mean wide, like a ziggurat or a pyramid. It’s waaay safer than some thousand-story death trap, but it will last for thousands of years without any expensive maintenance. How’s that for a fair bargain?”

4. “Psh,” scoffs @@RANDOMNAME@@, one of your more casual advisers, as she rolls her eyes. “It’s true that @@NAME@@ has reached its zenith, but there is such a thing as modesty. In fact, we could very well do with regulations on the tall and big buildings we already have instead. They are symbols of arrogance, acrophobia... and suggestive imagery. Have you ever seen what the @@CAPITAL@@ Building resembles from a certain angle?”

5. “What’s with @@NAME@@’s obsession with making things all big and futuristic? Compensating for something?” mocks @@RANDOMNAME@@, a gaudy Marche Norian artist-architect. “In Marche Noire we pride ourselves on our spectacular construction projects, some of which are still standing after a thousand years. Our buildings have an ageless and classical beauty to them as opposed to your modern monstrosities. Take a look at our majestic Maxmillia Familia. Granted it’s been under construction for a hundred years, but it’s a far sight prettier than anything proposed here. Take a lesson from the pros, people.”

[b][anchor=644]#644[/anchor]: The Old Grey Matter [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
When newspaper [i]The @@CAPITAL@@ Herald[/i] referred to over 65s as “society’s growing burden” and as “unproductive leeches”, there was outrage amongst the eldest generation. Looking to prove them wrong, a number of them have ganged together to create the [i]Violet Hat Society[/i] - a gathering of retirees who are volunteering to contribute to the greater good. They’ve asked you how they can help serve @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. “I think we’ve got a lot to teach the younger generation,” says Violet Hat founder @@RANDOMNAME@@, putting the finishing touches to an impressive watercolour landscape. “Perhaps we could set up an official Advice Service, to pass the wisdom of a life of experience on to the younger generation?”

[2]. "Personally, I've always wanted to see Brancaland," hints society member @@RANDOMNAME@@, packing a beige floral-print trolley-suitcase. "If the government could see its way to subsidising travel for the elderly, we could spread across the world and sing the praises of our homeland. It'd be good for the @@TYPE@@'s international image, and good for my tan. Win-win, right?" [[color=blue]emigration is legal[/color]]

3. “If they really want to help, how about running some childcare for my rugrats?” asks working single dad @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, as he forks over 100 @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ to a gum-chewing young lady that you presume must be his babysitter. “It’d mean people like me could get to work, and maybe even engage in... uh... social activities.” He gives a quick guilty glance at the high-heel wearing girl as she leaves.

4. “Aren’t they lovely, these old gents and biddies?” asks thirty-year old @@RANDOMNAME@@, unaware how condescending this sounds. “No, no, we don’t need them to do anything! They’ve worked away and now they must retire and enjoy the sunshine. They can leave running the country to the young and healthy, while they go play bingo or work their allotments, or whatever it is that crusty old people like to do. Get these Purple Cap People - or whatever they call themselves - to form a working committee where they can debate with each other and keep out of everyone else’s way, then make a policy of ignoring whatever they come up with.”

5. “If they’re healthy and capable, shouldn’t they be in the workplace?” asks tax-paying twenty-something @@RANDOMNAME@@. “Let’s do away with the idea of pensions and retirement, then they can keep contributing economically instead of spending their time pottering about, interfering with everything and asking their grand-kids when they’re going to settle down and stop traveling. Or something.”

[b][anchor=645]#645[/anchor]: An Unwarranted Intrusion [North China and New India; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
When maverick cop @@RANDOMNAME@@ suspected that city worker @@RANDOMNAME@@ had kidnapped 13-year-old @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ with murderous intentions, @@HE@@ knew that by the time @@HE@@ applied for a search warrant the poor teen could already be dead. @@HE@@ kicked the door down, and saved the day. In the aftermath, many are asking if @@HE@@ did the right thing, and what lessons @@NAME@@ could learn here.

The Debate

1. “Why do we even need search warrants anyways?” asks gung-ho police officer @@RANDOMNAME@@, grizzled long-time partner of the hero cop. “All this bureaucracy does is make it harder for us to find the people responsible for crimes. If you have nothing to hide, then what’s the problem?”

2. “That’s typical police state thinking! Proper procedure protects the populace!” exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, a representative of anti-corruption foundation [i]World Of Watchdog[/i]. “We need to make it clear that a search warrant must be attained before forced entry, and we should prosecute this officer for breach of procedure! Can you imagine the police busting in while you’re sharing an intimate moment with your partner? Can you imagine if a cop with a grudge against you decides to break in and wreak havoc with your house on a whim? Is that what you want?”

3. “We do need warrants for sure, but sometimes officers see something that causes them to make a split second decision, when they have act immediately for the common good, without going through all the proper steps first,” says Chief @@RANDOMNAME@@ of the @@CAPITAL@@ Police Department. “I think we should judge breaks in protocol by the results. If the suspects were hiding something, then no problem. But if it the officer finds nothing, then we have to judge whether their actions were reasonable, or illegal.”

[b][anchor=646]#646[/anchor]: Lesson Learnt [Kynotsu ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Statisticians have noted that the prisons of @@NAME@@ are filled disproportionately by the uneducated poor. Many are now debating the advantages of offering education to inmates during their sentences.

The Debate

1. “It’s astonishing that we didn’t think of this before,” admits Junior Education Minister @@RANDOMNAME@@. “If we provide employment-oriented and life-skill education opportunities, we can turn these crooks into productive citizens! Getting jobs will get them out of a life of crime, and keep them out of prison.”

2. “That’s absolutely ridiculous!” yells retired prison guard @@RANDOMNAME@@. “Criminals are in prison to serve time! What sort of punishment or deterrent is a free evening class? If we educate them and then let them back out into the world, we’ve just created smarter criminals! Make prisons tougher, not cushier... You want to teach these scum a lesson? I got a cat o’ nine tails right here...”

3. “Look, lack of formal education doesn’t mean criminals are ignorant, just that they have specialised skills,” observes primary schoolteacher @@RANDOMNAME@@, handing out [i]’You’re Special Too!’[/i] stickers to everyone in the room. “Rather that starting from scratch, why not recognise what skills they have and try to find them suitable work? Murderer? Put that killer instinct to use in the army. Arsonist? Get that knowledge of fire into supervising controlled forest fires. Burglar? Re-purpose those skills in climbing and fine motor control into telephone line repair. It’s all about valuing people for who they actually are.”

[b][anchor=647]#647[/anchor]: Songbirds' Decline Ruffle Feathers [Ransium; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Biologists and birding enthusiasts alike are squawking over the recent yearly declines in the numbers of many migratory songbird species, particularly the @@NAME@@ Breegull. After some study, the unifying factor in the species experiencing decline is that their migratory paths takes them over Tasmania. Coincidentally, Tasmania is known to consider migratory songbirds a delicacy. Your cabinet has convened to discuss the matter.

The Debate
*1. “Those Tasmanians must be taught a lesson!” screeches @@RANDOMNAME@@, your hawkish Minister of Defense, who has never found a war he didn’t like. “If Tasmania’s utter contempt for environmental stewardship, and our nation’s well-known love of bats…” He pauses as an aide taps him on the shoulder and whispers in his ear. He continues: “...and our nation’s well-known love of [i]songbirds[/i] doesn’t convince you, what will? Perhaps military jets escorting the precious butterflies through Tasmania might work. If someone tries to so much lay a hand on one those flying fish, then we’ll bomb ‘em back to the stone age!” [[color=purple]Must have a military[/color], [color=purple]Must have aircraft[/color]]

*2. “Those Tasmanians must be taught a lesson!” screeches @@RANDOMNAME@@, your hawkish Minister of Defense, who has never found a war he didn’t like. “If Tasmania’s utter contempt for environmental stewardship, and our nation’s well-known love of bats…” He pauses as an aide taps him on the shoulder and whispers in his ear. He continues: “...and our nation’s well-known love of [i]songbirds[/i] doesn’t convince you, what will? Perhaps troop escorts for those precious butterflies through Tasmania might work. And if someone tries to so much lay a hand on one those flying fish, then we’ll blow ‘em back to the stone age!” [[color=purple]Must have a military[/color] AND [color=purple]Must not have aircraft[/color]]

3. “I’d like to suggest another approach.” coos @@RANDOMNAME@@, your more dovish Environment Minister. “Clearly we value songbirds alive and uneaten, and Tasmania does not. We just need to make Tasmania value songbirds as much as we do. What if we estimated the relevant migratory songbird population each year and paid Tasmania a small amount of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ for each migratory bird that makes it here? Peaceful and fair.”

4. “How about none of that?” clucks @@RANDOMNAME@@, your eagle-eyed Finance Minister while poring over a report on government revenue collected through coins tossed in wishing fountains. “We can’t keep frivolously throwing our citizens’ hard-earned tax @@CURRENCY@@ at every little problem. They’re just some dumb birds - let’s just leave the government out of things for once! In fact, with less songbirds surely we can cut back our budget for parks a bit?”

5. “What if we trained the birds to stop migrating?” warbles the somewhat unhinged bird fancier known as ‘The Bird Lady’, seen wearing a giant bird costume, and whose number you’ve been meaning to give to ‘Doctor Bees’. “I love it here, and migratory songbirds should too! All we have to do is get baby birds to imprint on government handlers, and then teach the birds to fly around @@NAME@@ in circles. Then we’ll be able to keep them to ourselves, protect them, and give the birds the love they need all year round. It’ll be a lark!”

[b][anchor=648]#648[/anchor]: Confessions of a Dangerous Mind [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
After twelve years of detective work notorious serial killer @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Lecter has finally been apprehended by the authorities. During questioning, it became apparent that she had already guiltily confessed her crimes in great detail ten years ago, but only to a local priest. He not only forgave her, but chose to keep the confession secret. Now the police have arrested the clergyman, claiming ten years of police work and five more murders were at least partly the result of this silence.

The Debate
1. "The confessional seal and the absolute duty of non-disclosure are core tenets of our beliefs," explains cleric @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, from his police cell. "Our holy texts command that we offer forgiveness to the truly repentant. At that time, the woman was incredibly shaken by the crimes she had committed. I make no apologies for acting as I did. Secular law enforcement is your concern, while my concern is the immortal souls of all mankind. Let's keep the two separate, shall we?"

2. "The guilty will say anything to save their skin," growls police officer @@RANDOMNAME@@, who always plays the 'bad cop' during interrogations. "In all honesty, I don't give a flying @@ANIMAL@@ turd what this crackpot's religion tells him. He is an accessory to murder, and because he didn't call the police like a responsible citizen, five young victims are dead! Religion doesn't entitle you to break the law. As long as you live in @@NAME@@, you abide by OUR laws, not your phoney-baloney god's."

3. "Holy laws do indeed transcend the puny rules of the mundane!" declares the elderly former leader of [i]The Flying Suns UFO[/i] cult, emerging from his underground bunker for the first time in decades. "Laws of faith come straight from infallible divinity, not from weak and fallible Man! All religions understand this truth, no matter who they worship, so all religions must have the right to put their holy beliefs ahead of mortal law. If you do not heed this warning, you will all perish in a fiery hell-storm when the Ancient Discs of Mu return from beyond the stars!"

[b][anchor=649]#649[/anchor]: Made In Maxtopia [Siarki; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
When ultra-cheap underwear imports from Maxtopia drove a local factory into bankruptcy, the newly unemployed factory workers surrounded you during a press conference to demand you protect local manufacturing by any means necessary.

The Debate
1. "Save our jobs!" begs a recently unemployed worker, @@RANDOMNAME@@, who seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. "I put years of my own sweat into that factory textile job, figuratively and literally. It's the only work I know. Please, @@LEADER@@, implement tariffs or subsides to keep alive the domestic clothing industry. Otherwise we'll be thrown out on our asses, forced to buy shoddy Maxtopian undergarments."

2. "We have the freedom to know what we are buying!" exclaims an unusually patriotic consumer advocate, while barging into the crowd of workers and ferociously waving @@A@@ @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ flag. "When I buy me a new pair of underpants, I wanna see that 'Made In @@NAME@@' tag to let me know I am getting the best of all possible underpants. Absolutely everything for sale should say where it came from. That way we'll know to buy local, and this problem will probably fix itself."

3. "Why have Maxtopian imports at all?" rhetorically asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, who runs the local store where you used the toilet without buying anything the other day. "Or, for that matter, from anywhere? We've been dependent on foreign imports for way too long. @@NAME@@ needs to strive to be an economically and ecologically self-sufficient nation, where everything is made by our fellow citizens. Other countries might be able to make things cheaper, but no one works with as much pride as us @@DEMONYMNOUNPLURAL@@!"

4. "Wait!" interrupts @@RANDOMNAME@@, the owner of @@NAME@@'s largest department store, Humongo-Mart. "Okay, sure, maybe 'Made In Maxtopia' means slightly lower quality, but Maxtopian manufacturing is so very cheap! Sure, I had to replace my Maxtopian toaster three times last year because of a few teeny-tiny explosions, but that still cost me less than buying one locally-manufactured toaster! Have some common sense, @@LEADER@@, and allow free trade."

5. "There's an easier way to appease the masses," whispers your Minister of Foreign Trade, @@RANDOMNAME@@, while handing you the latest briefs. "Let's keep importing things from other nations, but we can pretend that everything was made in @@NAME@@. Put flag stickers on every conceivable product, tell the people that we're self-sufficient, and beef up the security at all ports. Then bam: the customers are happy, the department stores are happy, and our economy can keep importing essential resources. And of course anyone that mentions our hypocrisy aloud will be... punished."

[b][anchor=650]#650[/anchor]: Political Hacks [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue

Hacktivist group [i]KwikiLeaks[/i] revealed the existence of the so-called Trolls From @@CAPITAL@@, a government-sponsored organization designed to spread pro-@@NAME@@ propaganda throughout the internet. The group has recently been caught instigating a separatist movement in Brancaland, and you’ve personally been made aware that they were responsible for unleashing the dreaded DEAT virus in Marche Noire. Concerned “netizens” are asking you whether this group is acting beyond its mandate.

The Debate
1. “We should be giving these heroes a medal, not condemning them!” exclaims your paranoid Propaganda Minister while checking the room for bugs. “It’s obvious that Marche Noire and Brancaland were plotting attacks! Why else would Brancaland be hiking maple syrup prices? What we need is more funding and manpower to continue the fine work of my ministry. With a few keystrokes and the click of a mouse, we can destabilize our enemies... or at least distract them from more pressing matters!”

2. “Spreading propaganda was one thing, attacks on sovereign nations is another,” rebuffs Angela Nimoy, the Brancalandian Ambassador, seen dressed in the traditional Brancalandian parka. “Thanks to these @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ sponsored cyber-terrorists, the province of Quaybeck is launching a violent separatist movement! These hackers are an international menace, and you must do something aboot it! Shut these trolls down and extradite them. Or you’ll be sorry!”

3. “Are you going to let these foreigners walk all over us?” asks your Interior Minister who simply wants this issue to be dealt with before tonight’s episode of [i]CSI: @@CAPITAL@@[/i] airs. “We obviously don’t want to risk our friendship with Brancaland or make things worse with Marche Noire. These brave keyboard warriors just need a little policing. I can rein these groups in and remind them of their original mandate, which is to spread love, not war.”

4. “Why not disown this [i]Trolls From @@CAPITAL@@[/i] and state that [i]Kwikileaks[/i] is in the pockets of East Lebatuck?” suggests your easily distracted Minister of Technology while playing [i]Maxémon Woah[/i] on her phone. “This gives you more wiggle room to allow these groups to fight it amongst themselves. So what if they end up starting a few international incidents or if those reds in East Lebatuck retaliate? What’s the worst that could happen?”

[b][anchor=651]#651[/anchor]: Black Days For @@NAME@@ [The United Providences of Perland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Annually, retailers in @@NAME@@ mark down their prices a bit and sell “limited edition” items. This year, the usual frenzy of crazed customers fighting over toasters and flat screen TVs escalated to new levels. Cut-price madness may well have tipped into societal insanity: maybe you should do something to fix the situation.

The Debate
1. “Look what those savages did to me!” yells @@RANDOMNAME@@, an aggrieved customer waving a bandaged wrist stump at you. “I was trying to scan my credit card for a blender, and a wacko cut my hand off and stole the blender. The same guy also stuffed my leg into this peg leg. Now mind you, my leg is still in there, but I can’t get the damned thing off! You should ban one day discount events, and force any discount applied to be sustained for at least a week. If not for public safety, then do it in tribute to my hand!”

2. “That’s insane... A bit like our Low Low Prices!” retorts sales rep @@RANDOMNAME@@, aiming an exaggerated wink and a cheeky smile at you. “Look, our sales quintuple during discount events. Spending drives the economy, and this generates the tax that lets you run your government. So, everyone benefits! In fact, you should make it a nation holiday so people can get off from work and fight... uh, I mean [i]compete[/i]... with each other for new stuff!”

3. “Or, we could have a slight compromise,” states @@RANDOMNAME@@, head of contractor firm [i]International Retail Security[/i]. “The presence of trained security professionals can achieve up to seventy-five percent fewer deaths in-store! You should allow these ‘super sales’, but require stores to hire private security to make sure no one kills each other. That way, the business owners get to make lots of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@, but the public stays safe.”

[b][anchor=652]#652[/anchor]: Mayday! Mayday! [Outer Sparta; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Three weeks ago Oceanic Airlines Flight 209 disappeared from radar, and now a crash has been confirmed, with debris scattered across the sea, and the missing two hundred passengers and crew officially declared dead and lost. This tragedy was only the most recent airplane catastrophe departing from @@NAME@@, and anxious flyers are demanding immediate safety improvements.

The Debate
1. "Clearly these disasters mean we are long overdue for new aircraft," states Oceanic Airlines CEO @@RANDOMNAME@@ while playing with a model jet. "These crashes are caused by outdated, crumbling, and ugly aircraft like the Moeing 606 and the Airtrolley T300. In fact, the average age of any given plane is thirty years! We live in a technological and automated world. It's time our planes joined the modern world, too! We can build a next generation fleet if the government gave us some funding. Then our skies and safety reputation will be second to none!"

2. "Our aircraft aren't the problem, it's who's flying the plane!" replies pilot Hudson Sullenburger, running a flight simulator for students. "Did you know that pilot error is the number one cause of accidents? They've become lazy, sleep-deprived, and constantly tardy! We need more stringent measures on the training of pilots. We can introduce more intense and hands-on testing and ban anyone without a license from flying. Flying a plane is much more complex than video games make them look." The trainer now looks at the class and picks on a student. "Now Joey, you ever been in a cockpit before? Or have you seen gladiator movies?"

3. "I see these crashes all the time," sighs @@RANDOMNAME@@, a lead investigator of aviation crashes. "The reason they disappear from radar is because they break up mid-flight. Maintenance is the obvious problem. We need to require airlines and airports to perform constant maintenance checks on all aircraft and ground any plane with the slightest defect. Yes, that might be costly, but not maintaining planes is even costlier."

4. "Do you know how much time and money I waste dealing with all these regulations?" rhetorically asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, CEO of Budget Air, an airline so cheap that passengers have to pay extra to have a seat. "We're talking about metal boxes flying at 20,000 feet in the sky. Of course things are bound to go wrong once in a while! To make things worse my staff are constantly harassed by these government goons. No wonder my pilots are stressed out! The government needs to get off our backs and let us handle things ourselves!"

5. "I know a perfect solution!" joyously suggests train enthusiast @@RANDOMNAME@@. "The solution is to ban all airplanes! Not only are they clearly unsafe, they're loud, ugly, and are a big contributor to greenhouse gases! Surely we can rely on safer transportation, like trains or boats, for travel. They're much less susceptible to delays, crashes, and only a fraction of a pollutant compared to planes! All we need is more funding for public transit. You call them slow. I call them scenic."

[b][anchor=653]#653[/anchor]: A Cloak And Syringe Operation [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Vague intelligence reports suggest yet another terrorist attack on @@NAME@@ is being planned by [i]Ultra-Violet[/i], an especially extreme and hateful Violetist terrorist group from Tasmania. However, information is sketchy at best and the general feeling is that boots-on-the-ground intelligence will be needed to effectively assess and counter the potential threat.

The Debate
1. “Look, @@LEADER@@, I’m going to be straight with you: there’s no nice or pretty solution here,” states Intelligence Director @@RANDOMNAME@@, who is leading the search for Ultra. “We don’t have many Tasmanian contacts. Citizens of @@NAME@@ are viewed with extreme suspicion there, especially in the more rural areas that Ultra-Violet recruits from. My agents can pose as doctors who are vaccinating Tasmanians as part of the ongoing Spoon Pox eradication efforts. Doing this, they’ll be able to travel to the places they need to go, plant deep cover agents within the enemy ranks, and get critical intel to counter this terrorist threat.”

2. “You can’t do that!” gasps Dr. @@RANDOMNAME@@, a member of the international non-governmental organization [i]Doctors Without Quarters[/i], who’s been crashing in one of your guest bedrooms for the past few weeks. “In a few years, our program may be able to eradicate Spoon Pox entirely. And it’s not just Spoon Pox... we’ve been vaccinating against other preventable diseases too, like Yellow Tongue and the dreaded Bendy Creaks. Your deceptions risk the credibility of all international medical aid efforts, and could set public health back by decades!”

[b][anchor=654]#654[/anchor]: Not So Cool Aid? [Gnejs; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A review of @@NAME@@'s foreign aid commitments in the fourth world recently uncovered that large parts of relief funds have trouble reaching the people truly in need. Excessive bureaucracy in the distribution system and widespread corruption at the receiving end are being flagged as major obstacles.

The Debate
1. “This confirms all of my suspicions,” smugly states @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, Minister for Modest Living and Curtailed Spending, known for his heart of stone. “These fancy-named programs - like that ‘Rural-Urban Sustainability Engagements’ - do nothing but finance the decadent luxuries of tinpot dictators: private submarine strip-clubs and collections of gilded banana hammocks! Cut all foreign aid funding and put that money back in our pockets!”

2. “That’s painting an extremely one-sided, and state-centric, image of reality,” counters @@RANDOMNAME@@, a hip intern at Maxham Multinational. “If your minister had bothered reading beyond the tabloidy parts of the review, he’d see that some of the programs are actually doing wonders, like the well-known ‘Condensed Renewable Aggregation Production’. You know the common denominator of the successful ones? They’re not run by the government. Instead of mindlessly dropping all your funding, how about turning it all over to us? We’ll completely eliminate the bureaucratic mess you have today, and we’ll publish really tasteful brochures about everything that went well.”

3. “You do know what ‘NGO’ stands for, right?” queries your trusted civil servant @@RANDOMNAME@@. “It’s ‘Non-Governable Ordeals’, that’s what it is. I’m sure these... people... have pure hearts, but they’re not going to settle; they’ll have lobbyists out day and night pushing for you to increase their share of our budget. Let me and my colleagues at the Department of Bureaucratic Oversight take over our aid commitments. We’ll ensure proper implementation in no time, and with only a slight overhead.”

[4]. “Why do we care about poor people in places we can’t pronounce anyway?” your brother asks frankly, stabbing a virtual beggar in his Panty Theft Auto video game. “Those images of starving children are so passé, and no amount of conscience-cash is going to change a thing. Use that money to prop up some of our domestic industries, like, I don’t know, video games, maybe? It’s just a matter of time before the problem fades away, I mean, like literally!” [[color=blue]Video games are legal[/color]]

[b][anchor=655]#655[/anchor]: No Bones About It [ProPublica; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A group of religious fanatics have broken into the @@CAPITAL@@ Natural History Museum and destroyed a 75 million-year-old [i]Gorgosaurus[/i] skeleton - the only one of its kind in @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. “Those maniacs! They blew it all up! Damn them!” wails Dr. Alana Grant, pop-palaeontologist and author of the dubiously-researched [i]Tyrannosaurs of the Jurassic[/i], falling to her knees in horror. “Skeletons like this one provide rare and valuable insight about the history of life on our planet. We must do everything we can to stop these fools from destroying important scientific artifacts! Fortify and defend our museums, by violent means if necessary!”

2. Dr. Maurice Zaius, self proclaimed defender of the faith, slams his religion’s holy scrolls down on your desk, smashing your collection of rare ammonites. “These devout believers were doing the work of the Divine! These demon-lizards are fakes, from the depths of damnation! They are fabrications, to promote the ungodly theory that I call EVIL-lution. We should shut down these houses of lies that call themselves museums, and instead create temples that teach only Holy Truth. Sic semper tyrannosaurus!”

3. Mathematician @@RANDOMNAME@@, wearing a #notallpriests T-shirt has the decency to look embarrassed by the previous speaker. “I’m thinking the underlying problem here is that followers of science and religion are always taught to be adversarial to each other. Couldn’t we address that instead, with government-sponsored Faith Academies reconciling the scientific method with theological debate? Many of the greatest advancements were historically made by faith-led nations. Shall we see if we can join them?”

*4. “This raises an interesting point,” muses patriotic soldier @@RANDOMNAME@@. “I hear these dinosaurs were gigantic, killer monsters that ate flesh and struck fear into all who opposed them! Forget the bones of the past - you should be resurrecting those beasts to attack the enemies of @@NAME@@. Imagine a pack of hungry Velociraptors, tearing apart your terrified foes!” [color=purple]Must not have Dinosaurs[/color]]

*5. “I’m kind of not seeing the big deal here,” says dino-wrangler Ewen Grady, riding an impressively large and flatulent [i]pentaceratops[/i] into your presence. “I mean, it’s just a theropod skeleton. We got a few living and breathing theros, including some of this species. Tell you what, boss, I’ll donate the museum some new bones, and in return maybe you can subsidise our [i]apatosaurus[/i] ranch?” [[color=purple]Must have Dinosaurs[/color]]

[b][anchor=656]#656[/anchor]: Ransoms Noted [The United States of Merca; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Five @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ journalists were captured and taken hostage by violent extremist rebels in unstable southern Maxtopia, and the captors are demanding a million @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ per hostage for their safe return.

The Debate
1. “These brave souls need to be brought home safely!” wails @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, father to one of the journalists. “We can’t afford that sort of money, but you, the government can! Show some heart, @@LEADER@@, and don’t stand in the way of my son’s freedom.”

2. “If they’re looking for money, they should know that we don’t have it to give to them,” argues former intelligence operative Neil Liamson. “But what we do have is a particular set of skills acquired over many years in government... I’m talking about reactionary counter-terrorist legislation! Let’s make paying ransoms a felony, and use the hostage situation to justify an increase in domestic surveillance and security. As for this situation, send in the special forces. We don’t negotiate with terrorists.”

[3]. Wild-haired scientist @@RANDOMNAME@@ barrels into your office, panting heavily. “Stop! We CAN have our cake and eat it too! We should make the drop, but insist on cash payment. Then, we contaminate the bank-notes with radioactive material, and watch as the hostage-takers, their associates and their families die from radiation poisoning. That basically solves the problem!” [[color=purple]Must have physical currency[/color]]

4. “You know, one of the hostages is the son of one of our closest media allies...” murmurs @@RANDOMNAME@@, one of your policy advisors. “Can’t we publicly take a firm stance against terrorism, but privately strike a hush-hush deal with the terrorists? We can trade arms to them on the quiet, and they can make sure that they don’t hurt anyone [i]important[/i].”

[b][anchor=657]#657[/anchor]: Put A Fence Around The Commons Floor? [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Protesting a recent policy decision you made, one of your prominent cabinet ministers, Judas Benedict, today crossed the floor and joined the main opposition party. You and some more loyal ministers are now holding an emergency debate on this.

The Debate
1. “Floor-crossing is against democracy!” roars your Majority Whip, literally taking a birch rod to the backside of a recalcitrant backbencher. “Not only is floor-crossing a betrayal of the the party, it is a betrayal of the voters who elect politicians on the basis of their political party. When politicians leave their party they must resign and seek re-election.”

2. “@@LEADER@@, the only reason you’re getting upset is because one of yours came to us,” gloats the Leader of the Opposition, helping himself to a sandwich from your lunchbox. “Sometimes people have a change of heart and begin to see the world in a different light. It is the right of every person and politician to ally themselves with whatever party best suits their conscience. The people give democratic mandate to the individual, who then uses it according to best judgement.”

3. “I have a solution that renders the whole problem of floor-crossing moot,” interjects independent politician @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@ from the back of the crowded room, hoping you’ll notice her. “Why don’t we simply scrap all political parties and have every politician run as an independent? Think about it! Partisan loyalty is a barrier to true freedom. Let politicians campaign on their individual merits, and represent no-one but themselves.”

[b][anchor=658]#658[/anchor]: A Sickening Dilemma [Ransium; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
After encouraging the anti-vaccination movement, vaccine rates have continued to drop while Rubellan Measles has reached epidemic levels. As thousands more grow ill every day, voices across the nation are pleading with you to do something before the situation becomes completely untenable.

The Debate
1. “I warned you there would be consequences to encouraging this anti-vaccine movement!” reminds your Health Minister, ominously decked out in a full hazmat suit. “With drastic action we might still be able to right this ship: declare martial law, prevent all non-essential personnel from leaving their homes, and proclaim mandatory hospital quarantines for anyone who might be showing symptoms. With emergency funding for healthcare and the military, @@NAME@@ will endure. This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but without it, the results would be absolutely ghastly. And for Violet’s sake, bring back a comprehensive vaccination program!”

2. “That would be horrendously expensive!” cries one of your more brutal body guards. “I have a solution that’s slightly more... direct. I say we take care of the problem before it can spread further. Put me in charge of a ‘Sanitation Squad’ and anyone who starts to show any signs of being sick with Rubellan Measles will be taken care of if you know what I mean.” He gestures at his weapon. “If everyone who is sick is ‘removed’, we will be disease free overnight.”

3. “Domina Hyacinthinum, dona eis requiem,” chants local abbot, Father @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, while walking into the meeting and whacking himself in the head with a board. “Blessings, Scipio. Rubellan Measles is clearly a plague sent by Violet to deal with the sinners in @@NAME@@. If you tell the people to live their lives according to Violet’s will and order them to engage in daily self-flagellation, then faster than you can say ‘Amen’, Rubellan Measles will be a thing of the past!”

4. “I’ve been thinking,” posits @@RANDOMNAME@@, who happens to be a Rubellan Measles survivor, “maybe this whole thing isn’t as bad as everyone is making it out to be? I mean sure lots of people are dying, but what about survival of the fittest, and all that? The end result from all this will eventually be a more disease resistant populace. Too much medical spending is wasted on keeping those alive that, to be perfectly frank, nature and genetics doesn’t intend to let live.”

[b][anchor=659]#659[/anchor]: Ramping Up The Difficulty [Singapore no2; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Earlier this week, you were supposed to meet with the first disabled team of explorers to conquer the icy slopes of the Bigtopian tundra. However, your office proved to be inaccessible to the adventurers and the meeting was cancelled. Disability awareness groups are outraged that those with impairments can't access government buildings, many of which provide them the help and support they need.

The Debate
1. "We must put an end to the discrimination against people with disabilities," declares @@RANDOMNAME@@, the spokesperson of the awareness group All Access, through a speech synthesizer. "Many of us face great difficulty in climbing steps, reading text, or listening to auditory sources or conveying messages. The government must improve the accessibility to premises and information so that we are treated fairly and have the ability to contribute to society."

2. "It might sound nice to have more ramps and guide dogs, but the real problem isn't infrastructure, it's society's treatment of the intellectually and physically disadvantaged," observes @@RANDOMNAME@@, a concerned parent. "If people had stopped to open doors, and to help the disabled athletes up the steps, then we wouldn't need special adaptations to the buildings. Kindness and helpfulness should be taught at school, with kids learning to assist those who need help and to stop bullying them because they're different. That's the way to go forward."

3. "Hold on a minute! Making modifications to historic government buildings is cultural vandalism and awfully expensive!" objects @@RANDOMNAME@@, your rather obsessive Minister of @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Heritage. "We can't destroy centuries' worth of history and deface the structures with modern architecture just to improve accessibility! I sympathize with these people's plight, but our culture and history are too important to destroy!"
