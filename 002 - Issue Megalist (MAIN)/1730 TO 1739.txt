[b][anchor=1730]#1730[/anchor]: Cloudy With a Chance of Fecal Matter [Skibidigoonistan; ed: Bisofeyr][/b]

The Issue
Last night's spectacular meteor shower was actually something far less celestial: "space peanuts," solidified clumps of human excrement ejected from passenger aircraft.

The Debate
1. "This is total muck!" cries the chair of the anti-aircraft group Death From Above, with a suspicious brown residue at the corner of their lip. "Not only do planes pollute our skies, but now they're raining down poop meteors on us! I say that's one step too far — you must ban all civilian aircraft before they drop another round of dung on our people!"

*2. "In case you haven't heard it: everyone poops," shrugs the CEO of major airline Bloeing. "When we're up in the air, people need to go and ejecting the waste mid-flight is the only efficient and cost-effective way to get rid of it. Why not compromise: we tell you when we're going to drop a load, and you can charge people to come on down and watch the show?" [[color=blue]Must be capitalist[/color] / [color=red]Must not be socialist[/color]]

*3. In case you haven't heard it: everyone poops," shrugs the chair of the government aviation board. "When we're up in the air, people need to go and  ejecting the waste mid-flight is the only efficient and cost-effective way to get rid of it. Why not compromise: we tell you when we're going to drop a load, and you can charge people to come on down and watch the show?" [[color=red]Must not be capitalist[/color] / [color=blue]Must be socialist[/color]]

4. "Behold, my turn-feces-into-fuel-inator!" shrieks local mad scientist Dr. Gloopenschwarz as he barges into your office, with a teal-skinned monotreme tailing him. "With the click of a button, this can turn foul-smelling human dung into mega-efficient biofuel! Clean-burning, eco-friendly, and dirt cheap — if you're able to ignore the smell, that is. Invest in my inator and we will install this in every plane that dots our skies and finally bring a use to refuse across the entire tri-the Pacific area!"

5. "Seems to me that you should blame the fool who didn't go at the airport," declares your great-great-grandmother, who recently escaped her care facility and is now rocking gently in your office. "The solution's simple: ban pooping on planes. If they didn't think ahead and relieve themselves before they stepped foot on their flight, they can suffer the consequences. And as the saying goes: you can't make a poop meteor without the poop."

The Debate
[1]. "As you are no doubt aware, we in Savoiia have ended the primitive practice of euthanasia," remarks Ambassador Hugh T. Nesha. "But some of our citizens haven't yet accepted the sanctity of life, and some of those selfish, self-destructive individuals have come to your nation to be murdered by your doctors. Please, join us in banning this tragic practice". [[color=blue]Must allow Euthanasia[/color]]

[2]. "I have learned that some of my lost little lambs have found their way to your nation," condescends Jim Kong Om, leader of the hermit nation of The Peoples Free Democracy of Northwest Central Librestan, where attempted emigration is a capital crime. "My citizens will be returned to me, and to ensure no more of my property gets lost, you will close your borders, build a wall on our shared border, and apologize for letting things reach this point." [[color=blue]Must allow Emigration[/color]]

[3]. "Howdy there, partner," drawls Davis Jefferson, a bounty hunter from Brasilistan. "Now, since y'all don't keep slaves, some of our slaves have taken to hoppin' the border, thinkin' it'll make 'em free, but that's our property runnin' around stirrin' up trouble. I'd much appreciate it if you'd order your government to work with us to wrangle these runaways and return 'em to their owners. We might even let you keep a few for your troubles." [[color=red]Must not allow Slavery[/color]]

[4]. "Ugh, it smells like dead animal in here," utters Lief E. Griens, ambassador from Kishiresh, looking down his nose at you. "In my enlightened nation, we've outlawed the barbaric eating of meat, but some of our less civilized civilians keep nipping across the border to indulge in their baser instincts. If you place any value on the sanctity of life, you'll stop the slaughter and outlaw the eating of meat in @@NAME@@." [[color=red]Must not have Vegetarianism[/color]]

[5]. The clicking of a pen draws your attention to the side, "News flash, public relations is where it's at." claims the West Calypsan ambassador and propaganda secretary. "When we cracked down on fake news, some subversive journalists hopped the border here to keep publishing unflattering articles about my boss. You leader types have to stick together, I think it's high time you put reins on the media, end independent news, and make them write more truthful representations about you and us." [[color=red]Must not have State Press[/color]]

[6]. "TEN HUT!" barks Hernius Eutrus, President-General of Kawandaland. "In the name of defensive invasions, I ordered all citizens perform two years mandatory military service!

"I understand you don't allow capital punishment, however some of East Lebatuck's death row inmates have escaped to @@CAPITAL@@ to escape justice. We would be most grateful if you would send them back, and if some of your problematic citizens got mixed in, who would know? We get to uphold our justice, you get to uphold your moral high ground." [[color=red]Must not have Capital Punishment[/color]]

[9]. "On the other hand," the mysterious figure continues, voice like gravel. "You could just start executing them yourself. Then any of our fugitives can be handled here, and we'll start taking care of any of your fugitives we come across. A bit of quid pro quo, as they say." [[color=red]Must not have Capital Punishment[/color]]

[10]. The smell of cheap cologne announces the arrival of East Calypso's diplomat, who has come wearing a wifebeater. "The real sickness in your country is divorce. Honest men like me spend all day working, and come home to find their wife's run off with their brother. Y'know I think my wife asked me to take this job just to get here and ditch me. Ban divorce, make couples stay together, and someone get me a damn soda!" [[color=blue]Must allow Divorce[/color]]

[11]. "Complicit, all of you," hisses the ambassador from the United Federation. "Every day, thousands of babies are murdered, and I can do nothing but watch as people from enlightened nations, including my own, travel to @@NAME@@ for this wretched murder tourism. No more, you must acknowledge the sanctity of life and outlaw abortion like the slaughter it is." [[color=red]Must allow Abortion[/color]]

If this is already our international image, just imagine what things will be like if we loosened regulations across the board. Our economy would go crazy."

14. "What's crazy is thinking any of this is wonderful!" shouts General @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "A dozen countries demand we change our laws, you're blind if you see that as anything other than a threat.

The Issue
The largest forest in @@NAME@@ has become a funeral ground after the tallest tree in the nation — the Great @@ANIMAL@@ Cedar — was unceremoniously chopped down by a family of freelance loggers.

The Debate
1. "This is a national tragedy," mourns environmental conservationist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clutching strips of bark shed from the corpse of the ancient tree. "The Great @@ANIMAL@@ Cedar was revered for centuries in my community, but that didn't stop those heathen loggers from chopping it down and turning it into a flimsy futon!

2. "What a joke," scoffs seasoned lumberjack @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wielding @@HIS@@ new Superblade 9000 chainsaw model. "There are millions of trees in this forest, and you want to restrict the business that my family has run here for five generations because we chopped down [i]one[/i]?

"It can't be denied that our forests are key to our economic prosperity, but we must also acknowledge that some some of our people are honest-to-Violet tree huggers.

"I used to love listening to his music, but ever since his new tracks dropped, I fear that his fans and regular @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ may actually start believing his hogwash!

"Clearly, the problem is that people are still making their own music without government intervention.

The Issue
The notorious Dr. Gerhard Dwelling, a medical diagnostician famed for his unorthodox but impeccably successful approach to medicine, has been described with words such as "genius" and "nutjob", but most recently "unemployed". Dwelling was fired for malpractice after he gave one of his patients a supposedly lethal cocktail of drugs. Once he had packed his belongings, it was found that his patient had made a miraculous recovery. 

The Debate
1. "My confidence in myself far outweighs that of these regulations supposedly designed to 'protect' people," states Dr. Dwelling after ingesting some white pills from an unmarked bottle. "If I had played by the rules that patient would be six feet under, but they fired me anyway. The bureaucrats that run hospitals aren't the ones treating patients, all they care about is covering their proverbial behinds. Perhaps they wouldn't need to if @@NAME@@ had a little faith in their medical professionals, and let us take whatever risks we need to in bad situations. There may be mishaps, but I can guarantee that there will be more lives saved than lost." He picks up his cane and promptly hobbles out of your office.

2. Looking longingly at Dr. Dwelling as he leaves, hospital manager Elise Curdy says her piece. "I've worked with Gerhard for years now, and I know all too well that he often has brilliant ideas. But for all of the people he miraculously cures, there are also tragic, preventable deaths he causes. I can't keep dealing with the uncertainty of wondering whether it'll be recovery or death every time he tries something! I can't run a hospital where medicine is practiced based on feelings and hunches; I'm not a chiropractor! Stand behind sensible medicine and expand patient protection against quack doctors, no matter how hunky they may be..."

3. "The signs of their disease were all there, but somehow it took a supposed medical wizard to identify what it was," tuts Mirabel White, the Dean of Residency at a neighboring hospital. "The only thing that this incident has convinced me of is the need for more rigorous medical training in @@NAME@@! The government ought to throw some more grants our way. We can recruit top-notch educators, acquire the finest equipment, and ensure that every new doctor will have the experience to identify anything from lupus to sarcoidosis at a glance! I guarantee you, there will be no diagnostic dilemma left unsolved! Hey, and if you're looking for a program especially worth funding, I know just the place!"

[4]. "I couldn't care less about any of this junk! Why should one doctor's actions dictate national policy, anyway?" shouts the recovering patient from his hospital chair, looking thoroughly inconvenienced by the fact that he is still alive. "No, I'm much more worried about how my family will afford this gargantuan hospital bill! 20 @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ for a single bandage? Ibuprofen 30 @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ a pill?

"Hold it right there!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Administrative Affairs, as @@HE@@ snatches the napkin from the ambassador's hands and tucks it neatly into @@HIS@@ breast pocket. @@HE@@ then heaves a dusty file box onto your desk. "Take a look at all this stuff I dug up relating to this war. We can't just let bygones be bygones so easily; there's so many other things we need to iron out before we can proceed with formal peace. Check out this territorial dispute over this island... which sank into the ocean. And this island... which is now claimed by Skandilund. Regardless, we must look into these things! Weeks, perhaps months of complex negotiations and the perusal of ancient documents must be carried out before we can even think about ending this war, let alone starting trade!"

3. "You're telling me that a nation we're at WAR with is trying to trick us into sending them loads of our resources through this trade deal? That's some nerve!" growls your hawkish and slightly paranoid Minister of Defence. "A war is a war, no matter which century it was declared. Call off all this heinous diplomacy nonsense until the Qaanpalukans' deliver their unconditional surrender. Until then, construct bunkers across all of @@NAME@@ in preparation for an all-out attack, and expel all Qaanpaluk expats from our borders. It's better to be safe than sorry."
