[b][anchor=1460]#1460[/anchor]: A Burning Question [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Burpbarry, a well-known @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ luxury outerwear brand, has declared that they have incinerated 15 million @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ worth of stockpiled surplus clothing.

The Debate
1. "I can't believe these people set fire to a heap of perfectly serviceable clothing, while I don't even have a plain shirt to wear," wails @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the beggar who often hangs out in front of your residence, clasping the newspaper around @@HIS/HER@@ shoulders more firmly. "This is such an atrocious waste of resources. Manufacturers should be made to donate their surplus goods to charity for unfortunate folks like me, not destroy them!"

2. "Hogwash! You won't listen to this deranged @@MAN@@, will you?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of Burpbarry, looking flabbergasted. "Don't forget that we are a luxury brand, and exclusivity is maintained by controlling the supply side of the equation. What distinction would wearing a Burpbarry outfit confer on you, if any old scrounger could get the same things from a donation bin? Market freedom means being allowed to protect our brand value, and to dispose of our own property as we see fit."

3. "Frankly, your disposal method is disgusting!" fumes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an environmentalist and DIY enthusiast, sporting a hat made of a recycled yogurt tub. "If companies want to get rid of their surplus without diluting their brand, why not upcycle inventively? For a start, I think those fancy Burpbarry scarves could be braided into a reusable canvas bag. Perchance you should seize the end-of-season surplus, and employ skilled weavers to turn them into something new."

In a recent local election, homeless person @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ was denied the right to vote because @@HE/SHE@@ did not have any identification. @@HIS/HER_1@@ plea to vote went viral after a crowd of journalists, who were coincidentally at the polling place to report on a story about a prominent politician allegedly kissing babies, recorded the rant.

The Debate
1. "All I wanted to do was vote," sobs @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, in hysterics as the media scrum surges forward, hanging on to every word @@HE/SHE_1@@ says. "How does it feel to disenfranchise the poor, @@LEADER@@? You know we don't have the time or money to get an ID while we're trying to stay off the streets. Let us vote, no questions asked!"

2. "What a waste of time," says political pundit @@RANDOM_NAME@@, rolling @@HIS/HER@@ eyes while she speaks over an unflattering still of @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ showing @@HIM/HER_1@@ ejecting spittle midspeech. "Politically engaged voters will gladly make an effort to present identification when voting. It's a small price to pay to protect ourselves from the wrong people being elected! In fact, if we wanted elections to be more secure, election officials should check IDs more carefully in those crime-infested areas."

[3]. "The easiest thing to do would be to introduce online voting," interrupts your intern, whose high-tech Boogle glasses obscure her face. "Instant fingerprint recognition, ocular identification, strong passwords and meticulous analysis of cursor movements are the future of electioneering scrutiny. It's voter identification without the hassle of in-person voting. And, the poor can easily sign up at their nearest library." [[color=blue]Must not ban Internet[/color]]

4. "I'm astounded that this is still an issue," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, clutching a scrapbook filled with photos of you. "You're the best option we've got, never mind the voters! Abolish all elections, and give yourself the perpetual right to the highest office - a dictatorship is all we deserve."

The Issue
@@REGION@@ gave cheer last night after infamous terrorist leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@ was assassinated in a surprise raid by the elite @@ANIMAL@@ Team 5. However, jubilation quickly turned to controversy when one of the soldiers claimed personal responsibility for the assassination, forgoing the unit's traditional "code of silence".

The Debate
1. "What can I say? It's just the doggone plain truth!" bellows Sergeant @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, the offending soldier in question, as @@HE/SHE_1@@ props @@HIS_1/HER_1@@ boots on your desk. "You can see it all on the body cam footage, so it's not like anyone can say I'm lyin'. Already got some United Federation suits looking to make a movie, some dork wants to write my biography, the VIP party invites are rolling in â€” I [i]earned[/i] all of this. Y'all can't take that away cause some limp-wrists say it's 'disrespectful' or 'attention hogging'. Besides, it's good for @@NAME@@ too! Once my story becomes a blockbuster, nobody's going to question our military might. So how about you just give me a medal for a job well done?"

2. "Etiquette exists for a reason, @@LEADER@@," retorts General @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE/SHE@@ readjusts your lapel pin. "Even though Sergeant @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@ took the final shot, that mission was a team effort. When you start snubbing that core belief, you end up making soldiers of fortune, not members of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ armed forces. Oh sure, it's all fun and parties today. But then they start disobeying orders, thinking they know best. Then they start going rogue. Next thing you know, Blackacre slips some @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ under the table, and our whole army is goose-stepping down @@CAPITAL@@ to a different tune! We should discharge @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@ for unmilitary-like conduct and stand firm behind our behavior policies."

3. "Ah, nuts to that, General Buzzkill!" proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, another @@ANIMAL@@ Team 5 operative whose tinted glasses and long hair certainly violate some dress code. "@@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@ has it right! Your problem is trying to make the army all secretive and mysterious. It's just another job, dude! No one tells my old man how to sell stuffed animals at the mall. He just, like, does it. We need to be more like that. Dump all of these creepy creeds and regulations! Let troops say what we want to say, to whoever we want. Everything will work itself out."

The Issue
A small island has vanished into the sea, farmland was flooded when a river burst its banks, and whole villages have been near-submerged by rising waters. The reason for these floods? Sand mining: billions of tonnes of sand and gravel extracted from rivers, lakes and coastlines.

The Debate
1. "We can't stop the modernisation of @@NAME@@," states Matthew Mountsermon, your Minister of Residential Construction on Aggregates. "These materials are the literal foundation of our economy! If you want buildings and infrastructure, you need sand! Glass, computer chips... sand! Did you know it takes 30,000 tonnes of sand to build just one kilometre of a motorway? Avoiding flooding just takes a little planning, and maybe some concrete barriers. Nothing should hinder the development of @@NAME@@!"

2. "Our addiction to sand is staggering," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Environment Minister, as @@HE@@ tries to prove how easy it is to reuse everyday objects by cleaning @@HIS@@ fingernails with a paper clip. "At first they extracted it from quarries, but when those ran out, they took sand from beaches, then islands, now they're dredging the seabed. The construction industry needs to be stopped in its tracks. Who needs that much concrete anyway?"

3. "I've got an alternative," muses passing manual labourer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, hefting a heavy iron mallet. "Need more sand and gravel? We can make it. Just smash up rocks from hills and mountains. Bash 'em into pieces! Hammers! Bombs! Giant stompy robots! Wheeeee!" He demonstrates by smashing a marble bust of your predecessor.

4. "You know where there's a lot of sand? The desert!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your science advisers, as @@HE@@ stretches some kind of Day-Glo gunk. "True, desert sand is too fine and we haven't found a way to bond it together yet, but I'm sure if we give it a go, and give it lots of determination and government funding... Yes, we'll find a way!"

[b][anchor=1464]#1464[/anchor]: Gentry Genes Getting Grim [Ostrov Svobody; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Duke Geoffrey Bannister, a 13-year-old scion visiting from the ancient nation of Maxtopia, is an absolute oik who seems to lack impulse control and empathy, and is known to have terrorized his own fiefdom with no regard for human life. Many blame his odious personality (and his distinctive jutting "Maxburg chin") on generations of interbreeding. A council of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ nobles has been convened to discuss how this sort of outcome can be avoided amongst your own nation's nobility.

The Debate
1. "The things we do for love," complains @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ noble James Bannister, who is an indeterminate relative of the young duke, and has just returned from an arduous and prolonged trek to drop the young horror back home. "My uh... 'nephew' is a special case. But you can't always blame genes! I mean, his mother is a fine figure of a woman. A fine, fine figure. There have always been occasional bad eggs, but breeding true has benefits too. We have to think about our dynastic security and continuation of stable government! If anything, we ought to be quashing this seditious talk about inbreeding and bad genes, and instead require that noble blood is never diluted with the common classes. We are their social betters!"

[2]. "I love my dearest @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@; we'd play together at Uncle's estate when we were growing up, and that gives us a bond beyond our blood," chuffs Lord @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, his dangling jeweled chains hypnotically bouncing off of his pendulous gut. "But maybe we could keep the gene pool diverse and playtime interesting by adding two â€” or ten â€” consorts from the middle classes into the mix, and legitimising the bastard offspring by default. Healthy children, and more fun for everyone! Come to papa!" [[color=red]Must ban Adultery OR Polygamy? TBD.[/color]]

3. "Widening the gene pool is sensible, but we can maintain some decorum while doing so, and perhaps also accrue some political advantage," muses noble matriarch Helena Tyrone, smiling slyly at you. "I wonder if perhaps a small group of powerbrokers, led by yourself, could arrange matches between our nation's nobles and suitable men and women of power from across the world. Young folk should offer love to and breed with who we tell them to, don't you think, my dear?"

4. "Know what the problem is?" asks General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, immediately answering @@HIS/HER@@ own question before you can reply. "These loons being empowered at all. We all know that real power isn't blood, or genes, or nobility. Real power comes from force of arms, and command of armies. So, let's just get rid of this aristocracy nonsense, and centralize YOUR power. Long live @@LEADER@@! Long live @@NAME@@!"

[b][anchor=1465]#1465[/anchor]: Parking Pandemonium [Authoritaria-Imperia; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
A mall in @@CAPITAL@@ recently introduced women's parking spaces that feature extra width and better safety through improved lighting. Celebrity podcaster and influencer @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ recently had his car towed for using one of these spaces, and is bringing the spots into the spotlight.

The Debate
1. "These gendered parking spaces are discriminatory and they must be banned," says @@RANDOMFEMALELASTNAME@@ in @@HIS@@ podcast, always seemingly a few words away from being dropped by @@HIS@@ sponsors. "There were no places left! What was I meant to do? It's not like parking lots are dangerous places. Man, this incident really makes you think about sexism. Anyways, this week's show is brought to you by the Jock Club, where for a few rubles a month, you will receive a curated selection of underwear..."

2. "This mall's initiative is simply giving a traditionally masculine space a woman's touch," interjects Minister of Safety Birgitta Serling, while she turns off the podcast and starts capping all of your pointiest pens. "In fact, we should roll out a nationwide quota of non-masculine parking spaces. It will make it so much easier to park and will do wonders for assault rates! By bringing them down, I mean..."

3. "If you ask me, these solutions won't fix the greater cultural problem â€” the lack of safety," offers a passing therapist, showing you an inkblot that looks like a parking space. "If you fund more night-time patrols and pay for security cameras in all parking lots, fewer people will be anxious. And, if people are worried about being watched constantly, I'm sure they can get professional help. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to go; your two minute consultation is up. Any more and I'd have to charge you."

[4]. "SILENCE!" booms His Wisdom N. Sanni Teeh, Grand Kahuna of the Cult of Cyan, who has been pushing the little-known religious organisation to rename itself 'Cyantology'. "'Tis a great insult to our deity to waste time needlessly looking for parking spots instead of praying! The Maker demands our malls use..." he gazes up at the ceiling, "...free valet parking."

The Issue
A series of accidental shootings and catastrophic malfunctions has triggered debate surrounding the safety and reliability of civilian firearms.

The Debate
1. "I bought a pistol, not a grenade!" shouts former military officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, her arm suspended in a sling. "I was mugged yesterday, but when I tried to defend myself, my handgun exploded and almost killed me! This cannot continue! All firearm companies must prioritize weapon safety and rigorously test their products to prove they are reliable."

2. "This reveals an underlying problem: our firearms need an update," explains corporate futurist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, polishing her toy ray-gun. "Malanasia ought to innovate and overhaul civilian weapons with emerging tech like biometrics, recoil-dampening composites, and interwoven electronics. The resulting smart guns would limit accidents while also improving safety. Just shoot a grant or two at gun-makers to cover the cost of R&D."

3. "Safer guns are pointless if the average shooter can't clean a barrel," asserts firearms instructor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Malanese guns are notoriously unreliable, but their frequent malfunctions can be minimized with proper upkeep. All gun owners should be required to complete a training course in weapons maintenance. Maybe then I won't get dirty looks when asking clients if they're stripping."

4. "Y'all betta not be tryna mess with my guns," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wielding a rusted, homemade shotgun. "Malanese guns work just fine, and we don't need no safety courses or fancy microchips! All those accidents is just weedin' out the butt-brains!" She fires her weapon into the air, and the barrel shatters.

The Issue
@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ tourists @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_1@@ and @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_2@@ were recently on a romantic city break in the capital of Sacerdia, and like many other couples made a point of kissing by moonlight on the world-famous Lovers' Bridge. Unfortunately for them, homosexuality is a crime in Sacerdia, and they were arrested.

The Debate
*1. "@@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@ and @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@@@ perhaps could have been more circumspect, but they're @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizens who have committed no crime under our laws," observes @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Consulate Officer Paul Myfinger. "We have a moral obligation to negotiate their release. I suggest we could make a couple of trade concessions, favouring Sacerdian woolen goods with selective tariffs on competitor nations, for example. In return, our out-of-the-closet citizens can be gotten out of hot water. I'm also confident we can establish procedures to send home any future @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ arrested there. Everybody wins." [[color=blue]Must not have Autarky[/color]]

*2. "Jethras and Augustus perhaps could have been more circumspect, but they're @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ citizens who have committed no crime under our laws," observes @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Consulate Officer Paul Myfinger. "We have a moral obligation to negotiate their release.

Everybody wins." [[color=red]Must have Autarky[/color]]

[3]. Reverend Indy Nile is both a priest and a general in the Sacerdian Holy Army, and he has a counter-proposal. "Gayness is against the will of the Lord our God. We will give you back these transgressors, but you must recognise the holy truth that homosexuality is a grave sin. Ban batty-boy loving in @@NAME@@, and we'll extradite these criminals to your jurisdiction. Let us move forward together, in faith." He gazes up adoringly at a semi-naked statuary depiction of his deity. [[color=purple]Must not ban religion[/color]]

4. "We have to be balanced about this, I'm afraid," offers Foreign Office diplomat Hyde Yorlove. "Out of respect for judicial sovereignty we must leave the couple to the mercy of the Sacerdian justice system. To stop this happening again, maybe we can set up a bureau to issue guidance and travel advice for gay holiday-makers."

5. "RAAAAAAAAAARGH!" bellows perpetually angry gay activist Neil Foreman, tipping your desk over in a rage. "I am Gay Man! Hear me roar! My leader, we cannot negotiate with filthy homophobes and bigoted scum! Send the army in, and rescue my proud brethren, then bomb Sacerdia till they agree to repeal their homophobic laws.

[b][anchor=1468]#1468[/anchor]: Meat With Approval [Sedgistan; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The nation's strict animal welfare regulations for slaughter are up for debate, as the Order of Violet lobbies for an exemption to allow ritualistic slaughter.

The Debate
1. "According to the Book of Violet, the Prophet Max, Chapter VII, 'Ye shall taketh thine animal and, reciting the Oath to Violet's Dread Divinity, ye shall inserteth a red-hot poker up yonder...' well, you can guess the rest," chuckles eccentric subdeacon @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Currently, our followers have to import their meat â€” at great expense â€” from more tolerant countries, or they're stuck eating vegetables. Do you know what Violet has to say about the preparation of asparagus?" He winces for dramatic effect. "Grant us an exemption to these discriminatory laws, and allow us to slaughter animals as the almighty Violet demanded."

2. "It's obvious how that one will end up," growls @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ of the Hackett & Beatty Abattoir, gazing longingly at a room full of blunt instruments, chainsaws, and a particularly large stick with a rusty nail in it. "Restaurant buyers will just ask for Violetist-certified meat anyway, as they can serve that to anyone. Meanwhile, your average Joe Kill-Cow is stuck stunning and whatnot, and struggling to make a living. Rather than one-off exemptions for Violetists, trust butchers. Then we can remain competitive by finding cost-effective ways to operate and everyone will be happy. Well, except the animal-friendly lot, but they're too protein-deficient to make much of a fuss." She points a stun gun at a cow. "Daisy, I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse."

3. Miles Stewart, proponent of the 'Killing Through Kindness' method adopted by precisely zero abattoirs since last year's book tour, coughs quietly. "One life is worth as much as any other, and animals deserve to go in the same way we'd want to: in our own beds, surrounded by our loving family, with peaceful sitar music playing and incense sticks burning."

The Issue
While reporting an incident where no less than seven cats got stuck in the same tree at once, broadcasts on major news networks featured blaring noises and rapidly flashing colors, causing many discomfort, migraines, and in a few cases, full-blown epileptic seizures.

The Debate
1. "The last thing I expect in the morning is to be attacked by my television, and there's no doubt that this stinking migraine I have is from that news report," sighs beleaguered mum @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, whose five-year-old has loudly sung sixty-seven consecutive repetitions of the Baby Shark song since coming into your office. "The jabbering nonsense news anchors regurgitate is painful enough. News and other TV shows must be barred from broadcasting these sorts of noises and graphics."

2. "What if we made shows put epilepsy warnings before each instance and program?" suggests children's show editor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, showing you a happy face with a warning in colorful, flashy letters. "Then people will know when to switch channels, and networks will favor writers who are more conscientious. It's a nice compromise that can be applied to all media. Hey, I know a song about compromise we can all sing! Just to warn you, there's some moderately loud clapping in the middle."

3. "Why should my show be compromised?" refutes popular TV show host @@RANDOM_NAME@@, entering your office with blinding rainbow strobe lights. "Which would you rather watch? A boring old guy in a suit, or a cinematic extravaganza featuring epic explosions and fast-paced drama? If some people are too sensitive to watch the news, then they can always listen to it on radio or something. You know, you should give your official political broadcasts more pizzaz too. I'll give you the number of the SFX guys I use. I guarantee people will sit up and take notice!"

Big baby news from Blackacre: Supreme Leader Valeria Drake â€” the oft-hostile tyrant of that oft-hostile nation â€” has announced that she is once again pregnant. With heartfelt and sometimes sincere congratulations pouring in from leaders all across the world, eyes are turning on @@NAME@@, eager to gauge your reaction.

The Debate
1. The Minister of Foreign Relations lays her hand on your right shoulder, the sunlight creating a bright halo around her head. "Oh, let bygones be bygones already. This is a joyous occasion for Madam Drake! Let's break the ice between Blackacre and us, and send over our most cordial felicitations. It wouldn't kill us if we swallowed our pride for once, you know."

2. The Minister of Defense lays her hand on your left shoulder, tufts of her hair sticking up like horns. "Don't listen to that naive dimwit! We need to show the world that that vile succubus and her larva don't deserve any 'best wishes' to be sent their way. How about we discreetly spread some nasty rumours about how the father of the child is a descendant of Lee Terallihitlah, the Butcher of Bigtopia? You'll see, all sympathy for that serpent and her spawn will melt away like snow."

3. "Oh we can do far better than a few rumours," whispers Miriam Asda, a refugee whose family died in one of Blackacre's many wars of aggression. She beckons to you from the shadows, to suggest a third, even darker path. "I suggest we send our best wishes, and maybe some baby gifts, laced with subtle biotoxins that will induce miscarriage. Trust me, she deserves nothing less."

4. A civil servant walks in on the meeting, and ruins the ambience by turning on the fluorescent ceiling lights. "Oh, uhm, s-sorry... but I came in to tell you that you could also simply ignore the entire affair. Pretend that you didn't hear about the pregnancy because you were too busy volunteering in orphanages to follow international gossip. It'll create a positive image of yourself, and you'll have a great excuse to change the subject to how awesome you are."

The hall that once hosted the legislature's now-defunct upper house sits forlornly in the parliamentary building in @@CAPITAL@@, collecting dust, attracting vermin, and sheltering angsty aides seeking to evade their boss' supervision.

3. "There's no need to blow through money like that," snuffles your runny-nosed Minister of Safety, still clutching the tissue box that @@HE/SHE@@ has been carrying all morning.

4.

"If you invest in public parks, plazas, and hiking trails, I think you'll see more people enjoying the great outdoors and less people complaining about this whole indoor air quality thing, since they won't be exposed to it anymore!

Much to the dismay of your globetrotting compatriots, @@NAME@@ is placed near the bottom of this list, as many countries are wary of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ tourists for security reasons.

The Debate
1. "I can't believe I need a visa to visit a stupid whippersnapper country like East Calypso!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a retired schoolteacher wearing a floral print shirt, angrily tossing @@HIS@@ luggage on the floor. "This is all because of your regressive policies, @@LEADER@@.

A morning meeting with some of your ministers is just starting when your sister bursts into the room and into an angry complaint about how, when her family went out to dinner at a fashionable new Tiquitacan restaurant yesterday evening, her young daughter was brought to tears by finding guinea pig on the menu.

The Debate
1. "At first she was delighted to see that they had a pen of guinea pigs, which she thought was a petting zoo, until one of the waiters explained that those animals â€” which his people call [i]cuy[/i] â€” were actually there so that diners could choose which ones they wanted to eat. She was still crying right up until she finally went to sleep that night. It shouldn't be allowed! Some kinds of animals are food but some kinds are just pets instead, at least in civilized countries like ours, and the law should make it clear which are which."

2. "But the guinea pig has always been an important meat animal for the Tiquitacans, and it's really tasty too. I remember that from when I was posted at our embassy there," remarks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Foreign Minister, salivating slightly. "Not only should we continue to allow the use of guinea pigs as meat, but there are so many other foreign delicacies that we should encourage restaurants and shops here to stock as well: Skandilund's reindeer hind cutlets with eyeball sauce, for example, or Tasmanian fermented platypus eggs. Yum!"

3. "All meat is murder!" protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Environment Minister. "It's a slippery slope: First, people eat the flesh of 'domestic livestock', then they eat the flesh of animals traditionally kept just as pets... and then, maybe, they'll even 'graduate' to putting pineapple on pizza! It's barbaric! This incident is just more proof that we should outlaw meat-eating altogether."

The Issue
Your re-election campaign has been thrust into the headlines due to adult film star Catherine Gratwick announcing her full-throated support. She has since hooked up with your campaign manager to offer her services on the campaign trail.

The Debate
1. "That's a great ass... uh, asset!" assesses your brother, fingering through an assortment of Gratwick's films. "You should flaunt the association all over the place and assert your dominance over the competition! Ask for her assistance at every assembly. The moralists may assail you for it, but rest assured, you don't need their assent to get over the hump. Tell them to shove off and assimilate into the modern world."

2. "Screw her!" shouts your self-appointed morals counselor, Prue Dish, confiscating your brother's movies while he is busy cheering. "Gratwick is a disgusting, disgraceful deviant! Those are the triple Ds of her profession. You can't possibly get into bed with people like her! Listen to Prudence: denounce her. Reassure the public that you've never even heard of those demeaning films -- you haven't, have you -- and send demure surrogates to represent you. That prim actress who's been in the soap [i]Hard Days on Easy Street[/i] for fifty years just loves you."

3. "She's a good one, but you should always play it safe and see how it works," suggests your campaign manager, Thaddeus Kapoor, who seems to carry an infinite supply of latex. "Don't say anything about Gratwick's endorsement. If it's mentioned, obfuscate; maybe bring up that obscure novelist who wrote you that intimate letter. Then, send her as a surrogate to events where it might be useful. It's all about saying the right things to the right people, you know."

4. "Get on with it," moans Joe Reid, a volunteer for your campaign who entered the room unsolicited. "Catherine Gratwick? She's just some dumb actress. Why should her support mean more than anyone else's? Sure, lots of people know all about her, but don't our votes count equally? How about you celebrate the average Joes you couldn't do it without; maybe invite us to speak at events? It's us who win the elections, not the latest blonde or brunette actress in bad churned-out movies."

The Issue
In the aftermath of a series of high-profile, violent crimes, @@NAME@@ is reeling at the revelation that the identities and plans of the perpetrators had already been discovered well in advance of their crimes. However, the clever analysts who made this discovery work for the Security Intelligence Service of Brancaland, a nation historically allied to yours, who seem quite open on the fact that they're spying on your citizens.

The Debate
1. "All we want is a little quid pro quo," insists Olivia Lannister, a visiting agent from the Brancalandian Security Intelligence Service, flipping through papers on your desk. "The laws of our nations prevent us from spying on our own citizens, but they don't say anything about spying on each other's citizens. If @@NAME@@ shares what it knows about terrorists in Brancaland, we'll be happy to return the favour if our investigations discover another big crime ring in your country."

2. "This goes against the spirit of our laws," sputters your Minister for Transparency, trying to cover the agent's eyes. "The purpose of privacy laws is to keep the government from knowing about the private lives of citizens in any way. Don't try to get around them through foreign loopholes. This silly objective of pre-preventing crimes is not worth it. Do we want to live in a world where the government buys blackmail information about us from foreigners?"

3. "Information wants to be free!" groans the lone bureaucrat of your emaciated Ministry for State Security, emerging from the filing cabinet which is also her office. "Criminals and crime are everywhere in our country, but you wouldn't know that because we're not allowed to investigate them. Aren't you afraid, @@LEADER@@? We fear what we do not know, and that is why we must be allowed to know everything! For our safety, instead of buying information from those smug Brancalanders, repeal these dangerous privacy laws that keep us from getting it ourselves."

[b][anchor=1477]#1477[/anchor]: Some People Never Listen [Terrabod; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Two senior officials caught having affairs, five separate expenses scandals and the leaking of top-secret plans for the Cabinet Secretary's birthday party is usually more than enough to cover in one public announcement. You were therefore surprised to find that another issue altogether has caught the public's attention: activists representing the nation's deaf and hearing-impaired communities have taken you to task over the lack of a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Sign Language interpreter at your public addresses.

The Debate
1. "Being deaf doesn't have to be an impairment, so don't make it one," signs activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, adding a few more vulgar hand gestures that you are sure aren't official sign language. "Having an interpreter is the least you could do. Deaf people in @@NAME@@ are subject to a harmful mix of preconceptions and ignorance, so it's about time you listened to us. Perhaps you could also establish a national 'Deaf Awareness Week' to celebrate the contributions deaf people have made to society, and to persuade organisations and individuals to bear us in mind."

2. "I'm not paying for [i]that![/i]" scoffs your Minister of Equality, facing away from the activist to deter lip reading. "I watched an address by the leader of Albionia last month and was thoroughly distracted by a man waving his hands about and pulling faces behind her. She may not have died on stage, but it was a near-deaf experience! If these deaf people really want to know what's going on, they can watch us on the television and just turn the subtitles on. Automatic closed captioning is getting really good these days, and preserves the dignity of your excellent oratory."

3. "Speaking to the public is overrated, and clearly a waste of your valuable time," your crusty Minister of Public Relations whispers, his dry lips all but brushing against your ear. "As long as you do the job well, the people of @@NAME@@ won't care what goes on behind closed doors. And if things don't go to plan, well, won't you be glad you don't have to talk to them?"

[b][anchor=1478]#1478[/anchor]: Two Sides of a Coin [The Ankhalic Vaspriot; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
Following the abolition of the nation's smallest denomination coin, the millions of unreleased pennies already minted with the next year's date were ordered to be melted down. Since then, a few of these pennies have periodically emerged in the collector market, where they command a tremendous price, having apparently been smuggled out of the mint by an unknown employee.

The Debate
*1. "Unissued coins are government property, and the mere act of possessing them is a crime!" proclaims mint superintendent Nellie Deal, binder in hand. "Those coins should be seized for destruction in compliance with the original order, and the full force of law should be brought against everybody involved in this blatant criminal enterprise." Opening the binder to show a listing of auction records, she points to a particular sale. "I think I know where to start." [[color=blue]Must not have Socialism / Must have Capitalism[/color]]

*2. "Unissued coins are government property, and the mere act of possessing them is a crime!" proclaims mint superintendent Nellie Deal, binder in hand. "Those coins should be seized for destruction in accordance with the original order, and the full force of law should be brought against everybody involved in this blatant criminal enterprise." She shuffles through the binder and withdraws an intelligence report detailing a black-market coin sale. "I think I know where to start." [[color=red]Must have Socialism / Must not have Capitalism[/color]]

3. Museum donor Isaiah Swift-Longboard makes his way to your desk, carrying a long box. "Seize the coins and prosecute the criminals, yes, but destroying the few remaining pennies would make no cents! These coins survived against the odds, and should be placed in museums alongside @@NAME@@'s other numismatic artifacts." He opens the box to reveal a dozen slight variants of a similar coin, encapsulated in plastic slabs and differing only by date. "Aren't they so interesting?"

4. "You can't just take these away!" howls shoe designer and coin collector Farouk Whiteman, clutching a penny in his hand. "A functionary at the local licensing office put an approval stamp on the auctioneer's filing paperwork, so that means the government approved the sale. I had no idea it was stolen!" Sliding a grainy photocopy of the alleged document across the table, he continues. "See this? If you go back on your word and seize it now, that would be like a second theft!" [[color=blue]Must not have Socialism / Must have Capitalism[/color]]

5. "You can't just take these away!" howls shoe designer and coin collector Farouk Whiteman, clutching a penny in his hand. "An employee at the very real and definitely not shady place I got it showed me a government receipt with an approval stamp from the Deputy Secretary of Rationing's wife's brother's son who works in the local administrative office, so that means the government approved the sale. I had no idea it was stolen!" Sliding a grainy photocopy of the alleged document across the table, he continues. "See this? If you go back on your word and seize it now, that would be like a second theft!" [[color=red]Must have Socialism / Must not have Capitalism[/color]]

[b][anchor=1479]#1479[/anchor]: Fares Fair? [Paffnia; ed: USS Monitor][/b]

The Issue
A recent audit of transit systems across @@NAME@@ revealed more cobwebs than coins in ticket vending machines, even though trains, buses, and ferries are as crowded as ever. Worried about rising numbers of fare evaders and the resulting decline in revenue, your Minister of Transportation urges you to take action â€” starting by going down into the local subway and seeing the problem for yourself.

The Debate
1. "The trains are barely running!" laments a subway driver, leaning out the window as the train releases a worrisome hiss. "I got stuck in the tunnel for an hour yesterday because of a faulty electrical line, but the higher-ups say there's not enough money to fix it. To get transit budgets back on track, we need to raise ticket prices until we have enough to cover the full cost of keeping systems in operation. Sure, some people still won't pay, but with the extra money from riders who do, this ol' train could finally get a tune-up."

2. "Like fares aren't already a rip off!" yells a teenager who was just arrested for attempting to jump over a fare gate. "Transit should be free! Everyone has the right to get where they need to go â€” rich people, poor people, people like me who, uh... left their transit pass at home. You have some tax money lying around to cover free fares, right?"

3. "If you can't pay the fare, don't ride the train," retorts police officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ handcuffs the teen. "What we really need is more cops on the system to make sure everyone pays. Not only will it ensure steady fare revenue, but the trains will be safer too. To stop scofflaws like this one, we've also gotta get new security cameras, impregnable fare gates, heftier fines for fare-evading, and â€” hey, get back here!"

4. "It's not about the quantity of tickets you sell, but quality," sneers Mr. Ron Opoly, a tycoon who owns all four railroads in a nearby coastal resort city. "It is only proper that the upper crust should travel in a manner befitting our wealth and status. My peers and I could be convinced to leave our limos if you added luxury train cars to subways, first-class reclining seats to buses, and private cabins to ferries. Those of us who like to travel in style will gladly pay more for a more refined transit experience, and our premium tickets will easily keep your budget afloat. The rest of the teeming masses can pack into steerage like they always have."
