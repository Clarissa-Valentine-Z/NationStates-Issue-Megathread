[b][anchor=560]#560[/anchor]: Bicameral Backlash [Christian Democrats; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ upper house recently voted down a major @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ bill, provoking significant backlash in the lower house. Legislators have gathered in your office, and they're now debating whether @@NAME@@ truly needs an upper house.

The Debate
1. "The upper house is outdated and elitist," argues one of your rather ambitious backbenchers, MP @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is a favorite of the @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ industry. "It's an anachronism, a holdover of a bygone era. Bicameralism belongs to an age when the population was divided into patrician and plebeian classes. In the modern day, it doesn't make any sense. The upper house is a needless and inefficient institution full of overeducated and uppity old farts who only exist to obstruct our progress. It's a roadblock to the will of the lobby - um, the people. @@LEADER@@, empower the people's house! Abolish the upper house now!"

2. "The @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ bill was corporate welfare pure and simple, and that hack knows it," rebukes Lady @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the Mother of the Upper House as she enjoys her snack of camembert and caviar. "We need an upper chamber to give each piece of legislation a sober second thought. Our job is to scrutinize bills for errors and temper the transient passions of the lower house. We need to be given more power, including vetoing dreadful legislation that comes out of the lower house that violates @@NAME@@'s values and customs."

3. "The old woman is right," comments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of the @@DEMONYMAJDECTIVE@@ Electoral Commission. "Our nation needs an upper house to be a check on the lower. After all unicameralism would basically make you an elected dictator with all that unchecked power. At the same time, the upper house's disapproval should not be a death knell for otherwise popular legislation. I have a compromise. Let's allow the lower house to call a snap election if the upper house blocks one of its bills. If the lower house, after the election, passes the same bill again, then it becomes law regardless of what the upper legislators think. Expensive? Sure, but at least we give the people the right to break parliamentary stalemates whenever they happen."

[b][anchor=561]#561[/anchor]: Plug In and Play [Katalaysia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Bored by their games of breeze block Tetris and live action Pong, former gamers have arrived in droves to protest against the ban on video games. The gamers, dressed as their favorite Maxemon characters, have asked that you bring back their controllers and consoles.

The Debate
1. "Well, um... you see here, this research shows that video games improve hand-eye coordination, decision-making skills, and encourage creativity and problem solving," mumbles the meek, bespectacled, and incredibly uncharismatic @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shuffling some papers on your desk awkwardly. "I mean, yeah, the games can be addicting and maybe some people were copying what they were doing in the games in real life. You still shouldn't punish everyone just because some noobs can't tell the difference between fiction and reality."

2. "Our children have never been healthier!" joyously exclaims your Minister For Youth And Families, pushing aside disgruntled teens. "Children are actually bothering to learn about their world and getting fresh air and exercise. The problem isn't that they haven't got their digital toys. The problem is that you haven't given them anything to replace it with. Fund more museums, parks, and libraries, and force these tykes to make use of them. The next generation will be better than ever! Sure, it might cost a pretty penny, but it's for the children."

3. "For the children?" yells the stern 64-Star Commodore @@RANDOM_NAME@@, causing the younger children to run away in tears. "When I was a kid, nobody cared about what I wanted. I studied, exercised, and worked my behind off, as these punks should be doing now!" The Commodore glares at the remaining children, causing them to flee the room. "If our children had mandatory exercise or military school, then they won't need video games. We'd turn these hooligans and nerds into model citizens in mere weeks!"

4. "Okay, maybe we shouldn't go that far," muses your cat-obsessed secretary who has pictures of her felines scattered all over your office. "Why not allow some games, but just not the violent ones? There's nothing wrong with innocent games like Gumdrop Kart and Halo Kitten. Just allow games that any child can play without being scared or inclined to violence, and set up a council to rate the games. That way everyone is happy."

[b][anchor=562]#562[/anchor]: Return to Sender [Lenyo; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
South Tasmanian separatists rebelling against the autocratic Central Tasmanian government have long held public sympathy in @@NAME@@. However, a recent deployment of WMDs against the rebels' de facto capital city has shattered their burgeoning resistance movement. The source of these WMDs? @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "I can no longer sit back and allow these rebels to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids!" hollers the Central Tasmanian Supreme General somewhat confusedly and confusingly, while seated atop a newly bought @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ ballistic missile. "Fluoride factories, in the rebel heartland. A conspiracy, a foreign substance to poison our essence. Strategic Air Command has the go-code to finish the job. We need another bomb or ten. Here, your cheque, @@LEADER@@. Bombs, please, now."

2. "Have we learned nothing from this fiasco?" rhetorically asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a peace-loving @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@. "We've got no place providing the tools of megadeath in these overseas conflicts. Let's cut our losses and can the WMD sales before they end up being turned on @@NAME@@!"

3. "What? What? No, don't stop selling weapons, we are not asking for that! Just stop selling weapons to the wrong people!" demands rebel leader Baylor Garner, commander of the Southern Tasmanian Freedom Union. "We can only pay half what the evil Supreme General can, but we are closer to your nation culturally and ideologically, and we're frankly more decent human beings than our mutual enemies. Just limit your weapons trade to people who can be trusted to use armed might for what is right, and you will create a world filled with nations that are more like your own."

[b][anchor=563]#563[/anchor]: Resistance Is Fertile [Fotila; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
An outbreak of an antibiotic-resistant super-bacterium has killed five people in @@CAPITAL@@, and epidemiologists are linking the emergence of this strain to contaminated chicken meat from poultry given regular doses of antibiotics. Health officials, farmers and consumers are searching for solutions to prevent another outbreak.

The Debate
1. "There's a simple solution," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the @@NAME@@ Public Health Board. "Ban antibiotic use on animals. Antibiotic overuse promotes drug-resistant bacteria, and the chemicals involved are also tainting the food chain. If animals get sick and die, cull them. Super-bugs will be a thing of the past!"

2. "The government must not do that!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Head Poultry Butcher at ChickensBoxed Inc. "We will lose revenue and efficiency! We raise thousands of birds here and antibiotics allow us more meat per unit, more units per square metre and more units per @@CURRENCY@@. You should allow us to use whatever drugs we need to keep the farming industry strong!"

3. "Does anyone forget to mention why chickens get sick?" asks young farmer @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, as he pets Mrs. Tweedy, the favourite of his five chickens. "It's because they are cooped up in cages, unable to move, to develop their bodies, and exercise. The solution is for free-range farming to be mandatory. Meat will then be fresher, healthier and better tasting. We'll need more room, of course, so perhaps the government could donate us some city parks to convert?"

4. "Wait a minute! Has anybody thought about the little guy here? By which I mean, the poor, destitute pharmaceuticals industry?" questions Big Pharma executive @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, as he steps off his private jet. "If you block out sales, our profits will fall by several percent, and jobs will be lost. Perhaps instead subsidise investment into the NEXT generation of antibiotics? That way farmers can use antibioitics all day long, and we'll likely still have new tools to treat sick patients with."

[b][anchor=564]#564[/anchor]: Do Good Intentions Make Good Samaritans? [Saint Emygdius; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
Yesterday, a man was struck with a heart-attack in the middle of a busy @@CAPITAL@@ square. As the average @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ simply passed by, a foreigner in traditional garb stepped up and administered an unconventional form of CPR, involving stamping repeatedly on the man's chest, which did indeed save the man from certain death on the street. Unfortunately, the excessive force broke a rib and punctured a lung in the process, and the man later died from complications of this injury.

The Debate
1. "I did what was best to save this person's life, and I did, momentarily," shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while pouring oil and wine on your dying cactus. "I know I'm a shepherd, not a doctor, and the technique I used was only certified to be used on sheep, it is true, but that man would've died without me! It's a moral imperative to help your fellow man, and if people mean well and act accordingly, they should not face punishment for any unintentional and unfortunate consequences."

2. "I saw the whole thing," says @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Demosthenes, who was too busy painting @@HIS@@ nails to actually help. "Now, I don't doubt that this person tried to save the old man, not at all. At the same time, though, that stranger jumped on top of him and began stomping on his chest, and now he's gone; I mean, think of the family and stuff. Some just retribution, or at least a little compensation, is in order, don't you think? That foreigner ought to pay for the damage done. Good intentions can't be enough, it's what comes out the other end that counts."

3. "Hey, who's the doctor, er, nurse here?" bellows Nurse @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose head mirror is both upside down and facing the wrong way. "Emergency medical staff are the only ones who know what's what when it comes to these situations. I'm so sick and tired of amateurs blazing in, failing at cowboy techniques they picked up from some Whotube-channel and doing more damage than good. Laymen shouldn't be allowed to meddle; what we need are organized health patrols with uniformed EMTs on the beat, just like cops. That way, when there's an emergency, people who really know their stuff will be there to help."

[b][anchor=565]#565[/anchor]: 'A' Is For Academic Doping [Golgothastan; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
The problem of 'academic doping' has reared its head after a group of students were caught taking 'smart' drugs ahead of high school exam season. An alliance of concerned educators, anti-drug crusaders, and C-grade students have demanded an end to this practice to make sure that @@NAME@@'s youth don't become a generation of cheaters.

The Debate
1. "These students are doping themselves up to the gills in the hope it'll improve their academic performance," explains Student Union Vice-President for Welfare @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while hurriedly trying to finish an assignment. "However noble their intentions, the reality is that they're abusing drugs. We need the government to fund an education and outreach program, warning of the dangers and offering counselling and therapy. Outreach and therapy will solve this problem more than blunt law enforcement ever will."

2. "Education and outreach? How about I demonstrate some outreach with my truncheon!" screams the Head of Narcotics Control @@RANDOM_NAME@@, accidentally knocking over a plant pot while demonstrating. "I don't care what they're studying: these kids are junkies and derelicts, and we need to clamp down on them. We need strong enforcement, including random drug testing, strip searches, and sniffer dogs in exam halls! Just give us the go - and the money."

*3. "Please, show a little compassion. C-O-M-P-A-S-S-I-O-N. Compassion!" pleads national spelling champion @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while frantically chewing @@HIS@@ nails and twitching uncontrollably. "I have to concentrate if I'm going to get into a top university, and if a little pill can help me, then why shouldn't it be my choice? Some students guzzle coffee or chain-smoke cigarettes, and those are much worse for their health. Cracking down on academic doping would only be punishing those who want to perform well. That would be counterproductive. C-O-U-N-T..." [[color=blue]Smoking is legal[/color]]

**4. "Why have exams at all? Everyone knows that they're a waste of everybody's time," admits visibly stressed out teacher Edna Crandall, who is on her tenth cigarette of the day. "In fact, do we really need a proper curriculum to follow? Schools and teachers should be able to teach whatever they think is relevant. This can be learning a new language or the intricacies of soap opera love triangles. The schools would save some cash, and it would make my job much easier too." [[color=blue]Smoking is legal[/color]]

*5. "Please, show a little compassion. C-O-M-P-A-S-S-I-O-N. Compassion!" pleads national spelling champion @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while frantically chewing @@HIS@@ nails and twitching uncontrollably. "I have to concentrate if I'm going to get into a top university, and if a little pill can help me, then why shouldn't it be my choice? Some students guzzle coffee or munch chocolates, and those are much worse for their health. Cracking down on academic doping would only be punishing those who want to perform well. That would be counterproductive. C-O-U-N-T..." [[color=red]Smoking is illegal[/color]]

**6. "Why have exams at all? Everyone knows that they're a waste of everybody's time," admits visibly stressed out teacher Edna Crandall, knocking back a handful of nicotine-replacement lozenges. "In fact, do we really need a proper curriculum to follow? Schools and teachers should be able to teach whatever they think is relevant. This can be learning a new language or the intricacies of soap opera love triangles. The schools would save some cash, and it would make my job much easier too."

[b][anchor=566]#566[/anchor]: Drive My Car [Louisadam; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
While parking your car for a short press conference to pander to families in @@CAPITAL@@, you are besieged by citizens and cops fighting over parking tickets, of all things. All sides seem unusually passionate about the topic, and you are doing your best to calm down the angry crowd.

The Debate
1. "These deadbeats think that if they neglect to pay their tickets for a few months, we'll just forget all about them," rants Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while pushing aside some irritated motorists. "Well they're wrong. The government needs more severe penalties to make an example of these criminals. After all, mis-parked cars obstruct the normal flow of traffic and annoy everybody. Hike up the fines, even take cars away from people that refuse to pay for their crimes. Then punks will know to respect my authori-tay!"

2. "You know the real reason we have so many unpaid tickets? They are already too damn expensive!" fumes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of the city's poorest citizens. "How can someone who barely makes enough to eat possibly pay for a parking ticket? One ticket sets me back half a month and a rich guy only a minute. Tickets have to be proportional to people's income. Then the punishment would actually fit the crime."

3. "How about we, the citizens of @@NAME@@, finally get a break for once?" complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while parking in a public fountain and splashing everyone nearby, yourself included. "It's not fair to make my kids wait five minutes just to find an 'acceptable' place to park. Let's just get rid of all of these silly tickets once and for all. After all, who's to say where is or isn't a logical place to park?"

[b][anchor=567]#567[/anchor]: Syntax Destruction [Drasnia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Your Minister for the Treasury, Allen Redbridge, has come under fire as market analysts and journalists complain that his predictions about the future of @@NAME@@'s economy are vague to the point of uselessness. His detractors are dubbing his avoidance of clear statements 'Syntax Destruction': the presentation of extremely long and obfuscated reports that have little real content.

The Debate
1. "I shouldn't have to spend hours poring over reams of government documents for just one story!" complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, reporter for the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Enquirer, slamming a large stack of papers onto your desk. "Look at this! One thousand nine hundred eighty-four pages! What Minister Redbridge is doing is dishonest and despicable. You need to force him and those like him to use plain language and get to the point, so that the common people of @@NAME@@ will be able decipher what's going on in the government."

2. "It has been demonstrated," Minister Allen Redbridge replies during an interview, "that markets affect an unexpected multitude of industries at even the slightest suspicion of an impending perturbation. Thus, it behooves those knowledgeable in its idiosyncrasies to uphold their responsibilities in defending such precipitous gateways to knowledge, and acting in such a manner of least reaction, to satisfy their due diligence to avoid creating a condition which could potentially upset the precarious balance between bears and bulls, be they platitudes, or omissions. Indeed, one who acts in contravention to the aforementioned manner also acts against their own best interests, and thereby undermines status as well as dispels their cloak of competence. Such a transgressor shall be dismissed by the knowledgeable majority, of course, thus not necessitating any external provocation."

3. "Spoken or written words, delivered on matters of policy by person or persons within the government, hereafter referred to as a government commentary, constitute a legal statement," explains prominent lawyer @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It is my professional opinion that a government commentary should use only legal terminology to ensure clarity of meaning."

[b][anchor=568]#568[/anchor]: Dismissal Denied! [Human Olympus; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
After a recent petition to lower @@NAME@@'s infamous "Reading Tax" was found in a dumpster, debate has sparked over the government's abuse of veto powers.

The Debate
1. "@@SLOGAN@@, my foot!" protests aspiring revolutionary @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If you aren't going to listen to the people, at least be honest about it. Go ahead! Try your little mad grab for power, @@LEADER@@! The people dare you!"

2. "Don't let these warmongers bait you!" cautions your trusted adviser, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Obviously, we can't just eliminate your veto power, but what if you just made a super sincere promise to use more restraint with it? That might satisfy the angry mobs."

3. "But some of these proposals make my head spin," opines @@CAPITAL@@ Senator @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Who would really blame us for dismissing a petition to eat alien first born? The point is: people are dumb, and the only way to make them less dumb is to finally invest in our failing education system."

4. Your paper shredder looks at you, knowingly. It doesn't talk, of course, but you know what it's trying to say. It beckons you. Go on... One more can't hurt, can it?

[b][anchor=569]#569[/anchor]: Grand Prix De @@NAME@@? [Montagna; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
FeAR, the Federation of Automobile Racing, has suggested to you that @@NAME@@ would be a great site for a World Championship F1 Grand Prix circuit. The only problem is that you don't have a racetrack built.

The Debate
*1. Alexis Lefévre, head of the Grand Prix governing body, suggests the construction of a new top-end racing facility in largely uninhabited swampland in the east of your nation. "It'll be a boost to tourism and the broader economy in @@NAME@@, and it'll bring this whole dreary swampland area to life!" He stubs out his cigar on a nearby swamp frog, to emphasise his point. "Now, if you have the time, I have some contracts for you to consider with regards to construction, event management, and security firms, all with reputable, established companies and firms that I can vouch for personally..." [[color=blue]Smoking is legal[/color]]

[[color=red]Smoking is illegal[/color]]

[3]. "I don't see why we need an expensive new track wasting taxpayer money when we've already got a great ring road in @@CAPITAL@@," says Mayor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, well-known to be a die-hard racing fan. "The city has a vibrant atmosphere and stunning architecture, compared to the blandness and soullessness of modern autodromes. You know where your heart lies: bring this event to the capital!" [[color=purple]Must have unlocked @@CAPITAL@@ AND set a name[/color]]

**4. "Grand Prix racing is completely unrelated to what happens with road cars," argues Ruri Hoshino, CEO of Kadai Engineering Automotive Firm Incorporated, "but sports car racing drives forward automotive technology. Say no to the Grand Prix, and instead let the World Sports Prototype Championship hold round-the-clock endurance races at a stadium that we'll happily foot the bill for. All you need to do is repeal some crazy noise and air pollution laws. Sure, it may not be as glamorous, but it'll let us show off our wares and will encourage engineering innovation." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

[[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

6. "Why are these petrolheads so obsessed with auto racing anyway?" asks migraine-suffering riding enthusiast @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, from the back of a stallion that has just evacuated manure onto the pavement. "It's just noise, smelly fumes and testosterone! Ban motor racing, and invest that pot of money into equestrianism. It's a genteel racing event for a civilised society." Her horse glares at you threateningly, as if to support the argument.

[b][anchor=570]#570[/anchor]: Clerical Errors [Christian Democrats; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
As the General Synod of @@FAITH@@ gathers in @@CAPITAL@@ for its quinquennial meeting, a group of reformist delegates has proposed an ordinance that would allow both men and women to serve as clerics. The proposal has significant support among @@FAITH@@'s more progressive adherents, but there is a strong opposition movement. The measure needs your backing if it is going to obtain the appropriate amount of support.

The Debate
1. "The times are changing, and @@FAITH@@ needs to change with them," remarks progressive reformist leader @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, bringing out a copy of the Sacred Scriptures. "The Almighty said, 'Let us make human beings in our image and likeness.' And so they were created, male and female the Almighty created them." He turns his head up from the text and looks you right in the eyes. "We're all made equal, @@LEADER@@. That the clergy hierarchy has blocked change for so long is an injustice. We must insist that they permit ordination of both women and men. You know deep down in your soul that it's the right thing to do."

2. "The right thing to do, really?" rebuts @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, president of the Traditionalist League of @@FAITH@@. "For ages, our clergy has been just how it is now. This proposed change has nothing to do with doctrine and everything to do with the creep of secular values into @@FAITH@@." She takes a deep breath and continues. "Women and men, you see, were both created in the divine image and were created as equals, yes. But the Almighty made us for different, complementary roles. The sexes were not, are not, and never will be interchangeable, and @@FAITH@@ should acknowledge this eternal truth by rejecting this heretical proposal."

3. "Science H Logic! Why is this the government's concern?" complains science fiction author and well-known secularist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You have far more important things to do than to listen all day to debates on dogma and the merits and demerits of the sexual composition of their clergy. Frankly, the average @@DEMONYM_NOUN@@ on the street doesn't really care about this issue. If anything, you should cut all funding to @@FAITH@@. It's a drain on the budget, and that'll teach these superstitious bigots to stop bothering you with their trivial ecclesiastical disputes."

[b][anchor=571]#571[/anchor]: Family Feud [Appalatchia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
In a backwoods part of @@NAME@@, two neighboring families who have been feuding for generations are continuing to commit acts of violence upon each other. Members of the Caphill family killed a beloved friend of the MacDoogle family, "Ol' Man Jack", after a dispute over a farm @@ANIMAL@@. In response, a group of MacDoogles raided the Caphill household and killed the three men responsible for Ol' Man Jack's murder. The case of the Caphill-MacDoogle feud has gained national media attention, and there are calls for you to step in.

The Debate
1. "THEY DONE STARTED IT!" thunders Young Man Jack, waving a pitchfork menacingly toward the Caphills. "They killed my friend! Now, lookie here @@LEADER@@, we done did what we knew was right and avenged 'im. So why don't you and the coppers just stay outta our affairs, ya hear?"

2. "Three of my boys are gone 'cause of them. I thought I'd have their love till the end of my days, but it turns out there's no love in this story, just tragedy," weeps Anna Caphill, who has been alive for eighty years and has almost as many children. " @@LEADER@@, I demand you take in the ones responsible for this and hang 'em high, just like the good 'ol days."

3. "Now now, clearly the issue at hand goes back much further than this unfortunate incident," quips Dr. Laurence Friar, one of @@NAME@@'s top psychiatrists as he scribbles on his notepad. "There are decades of resentment and misunderstanding to be worked out. It is obvious that these slack-jawed yokels need some therapy and reeducation in order to be integrated back into civilized society. If they don't come willingly to their sessions, then the government can take their children away until they do. Give me some time, and some funding, and I'll transform these backwoods delinquents into model citizens in no time."

4. "Reminds me of a similar situation a few years back with the Jetter and Sharkley families," recalls @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Krupke, a cop from the west side of @@CAPITAL@@. "Tragic business, we had to end up relocating both families to opposite ends of the country. Just do the same with the Caphills and the MacWhoevers, and if they start up feuds with their new neighbors, I'm sure there's some barren, uninhabited islands we can ship them off to."

[b][anchor=572]#572[/anchor]: Reading, Your Rights [Gelimor; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Schools and public libraries have historically selected what books can be found on their respective properties, and many have taken this a step further, actively banning unsuitable books from being read under their roofs. A group of legally-minded high school students are challenging this practice, claiming that this is an infringement of their civil rights.

The Debate
1. "My brain, my choice what to read!" exclaims 11-year-old prodigy @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a copy of the controversial novel [i]Fifteen Shades of Violet[/i]. "How can we learn and be exposed to new ideas if not through the words of great authors and writers? People need books for thought like they need air to breathe. No authority, be they governmental, religious or corporate should be allowed to ban books for any reason. Now, if you could ask Teacher to return my copies of [i]The Manual of Home-Made Explosives[/i] and [i]Thoreau's Civil Disobedience[/i], that'd be great."

2. A woman with a bright red face storms into your office with a toddler hanging off her leg, and slams a copy of [i]The Bluest Eye[/i] on your desk. "Think of the children! Actually, think of the parents! How can we relax if our children are reading books about crime, child abuse or sex or worst of all, liberal politics? If a library or school thinks a book shouldn't be read, then we should show a little trust in their judgement. Now, my son is very advanced..." She pauses to stop the tyke picking his nose. "...and when he's older, he can read more at home. But not at this age, and not without supervision!"

[3]. Online, a guy with a unicorn pizza avatar named xChickSaitama93 sends you an Insta-Message, which pops up on your screen. "LOL. Y U need books NEway?

[b][anchor=573]#573[/anchor]: The Road To Blackacre Ends Here? [Zwangzug; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
As the Blackacre Olympics approaches, your diplomatic advisors have questioned whether @@NAME@@'s athletes should travel to a country known for civil rights abuses. Activists and athletes alike are taking their marks in your mountainside chateau, ready and set to go on with the debate.

The Debate
1. "You cannot deny us this opportunity after we've been training for years!" proclaims champion shotputter @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while descending into a crouch. "By sending our finest athletes to Blackacre, we can show the world what @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are made of. Let's show the world how much better our glorious @@TYPE@@ is. These fascist Blackacre weaklings will have no choice but to bow down before our athletic superiority. Give us a chance to succeed on the world stage, and we'll make @@NAME@@ proud!"

2. "Have you seen what they do to — GAAAA!" shouts Foreign Minister @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dodging a cast iron ball flying toward your desk. "...ahem, uh...wa-what they do to peaceful protestors? Attending these games would make a mockery of everything our great @@TYPE@@ stands for. For the sake of our values and everything that is good and decent in @@REGION@@, @@NAME@@ must boycott the games!"

3. A flurry of snow bursts through your door, followed by a cross-country skier. "Their internal politics are none of our business," says National Sporting Committee President @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, as she stows her ski poles and rifle in a large hole in your desk. "Look, why not let our qualified athletes compete independently? That way, the government can officially disavow the games, while @@NAME@@ still unofficially kicks some backside in the field. Plus, this will make it easier for us to get around restrictions on, um, nutritional supplements. Yeah. Supplements."

4. As soon as your aides close the door, it bursts open again as an upside down bobsled drifts into your chateau, stopping just before your priceless Maxtopian vase. Your aides turn around the bobsled, revealing the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ bobsled team, who came in last place at the previous Winter Olympics. "Yo, mon, what if @@NAME@@ hosted its own sporting competition for like-minded nations?" asks the captain of the team, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as the team steps up to lift the bobsled over their heads. "Our sportsmen and women deserve the chance to compete in these games, but most of us don't feel comfortable in these tin-pot dictatorships. This way we all get to compete and we send a message to our enemies." The bobsledders walk out of your office, as everyone in the room begins to slowly applaud the team.

[b][anchor=574]#574[/anchor]: One Small Step For Private Enterprise? [New Birgland; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Private space companies have expressed a desire to launch a space probe to the moon and other planets in the solar system. To avoid any legal entanglements, they have asked for permission from the government to launch.

The Debate
1. "The sooner we get off this rock, the better," grimly predicts daredevil CEO Dick Benson, who recently broke the record for the world's highest skydive. "We all know it's a matter of time before we destroy this planet, and exploring the vastness of space is our only salvation. Private enterprise must be allowed to develop space technologies. I'd go so far as to subsidize private space companies to help them on the way to the stars. 'Per pecunia ad astra', as I always say."

2. "Space shouldn't be opened to corporations!" exclaims buxom @@NAME_INITIALS@@SA engineer turned beachwear model Ellen Janeway. "These companies just want to grab our heavenly bodies and make money from them. The stars themselves will be exploited and stripped bare! Only the government - by which I mean you - can be trusted to handle things properly."

3. "Both sides have a point," acknowledges your diplomatic Science Minister Bill deGrasse Hawking. "The free market must be allowed to operate, but with reasonable rules and regulations. The idea sounds daft, but an asteroid mining company should be subject to the same laws governing terrestrial mining companies. We should have some sort of prime directive that state what we can and can't do up there. This needn't cost us tax dollars either: just have the enterprises involved sign an agreement to abide by the rules, then let them go boldly where no corporation has gone before."

4. "You've ruined this planet. Now you want to ruin outer space?" queries Gaia Peacedove, an eccentric environmentalist and host of the esoteric television show 'Antiquated Aliens', seen dressed in hemp fiber. "Cleanliness is next to godliness, after all. The Ancient Ones didn't want us to come to them, they will come to us. Stop polluting space with your fancy-schmancy space probes and rockets! Ban all space exploration, and focus on protecting the environment. They will surely see this as a sign that we are ready for their arrival!"

[b][anchor=575]#575[/anchor]: Sick Days For Sick Waves [Australian Republic; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
At the height of an extremely hot summer along the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ coastline, many workers have taken multiple 'sick days' to go to the beach and had the misfortune to run into their bosses, who have 'taken work home' to their seaside properties. Your chief employment analyst has estimated that the economic damage of the good weather has been significant, though he says he'll get back to you on exact figures once he recovers from an unexpected bout of period cramps that are keeping him off work today.

The Debate
*1. "We lost a whole summer!" says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your Minister of Productivity, while adjusting his swimming costume. "We can't just shut @@NAME@@ down whenever it's a bit too hot - our economy would go broke. Of course there's nothing wrong with bumming around the beach, but not while you're being paid... How about we allow companies, rather than employees, decide when somebody is sick enough to stay home from work. That'll put an end to their malingering tricks!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2.  "We lost a whole summer!" says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, your Minister of Productivity, while adjusting his swimming costume. "We can't just shut @@NAME@@ down whenever it's a bit too hot - our economy would go broke. Of course, there's nothing wrong with bumming around the beach, but not while you're being paid... How about we allow the government, rather than the people, decide when somebody is sick enough to stay home from work. That'll put an end to their malingering tricks!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

3. "I'm not a bludger because I take a few sickies," complains @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a surprisingly tanned data entry worker from his basement cubicle. "I mean cm'on, you can't 'spect us to work on bloody scortcha! Maybe you could make all places of work close down when the weather is really good, then we can go to the beach and not worry 'bout it. I mean, what's more important, a barbie and some beers with yer mates, or more bleedin' work?"

4. "Why can't we just start working on beaches?" asks @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a bikini-clad beach beauty who persuaded your doorman to let her into the meeting. "I mean let people take the papers and printers and stuff to the beach and do the work there! Pay people for the work they do, not the hours they are in the office. Flexible workplaces are more productive, so you should be subsidising and encouraging with appropriate legislation."

5. "I don't really understand what the attraction of sunny beaches is supposed to be," notes dermatologist Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, closing your blinds for you. " People just need to be reminded that too much sunshine and beach-side indulgence can be bad for you. There's skin cancer, sunburn and all sorts of nasty creatures, like sharks and jellyfish. Have you seen the size of their teeth? Sharks, I mean, not jellyfish. Here, look at this photo of this man whose skin fell off after he got stung. I've got that picture in a Public Health leaflet, you just need to distribute them..."

[b][anchor=576]#576[/anchor]: Light At The End Of The Tunnel [Kievan Rusk; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue 
A 33-year-old man, who has chosen to remain anonymous, has been refused state-sanctioned euthanasia by his doctors because of his diagnosis of severe depression. He's pointing out that this depression is exactly why he wants to die, and is asking that the right to merciful death be extended to allow his medically-assisted suicide.

The Debate
1.  The patient in question, avoiding eye contact and speaking flatly, makes his case: "I've felt like this since I was a child, I've been through every medication, seen a hundred counsellors, even had ECT blasting my brain. They've all done nothing, nothing at all. I'll take my own life if I have to, but wouldn't it be better if I could end my life painlessly and comfortably?"

2.  "You see where this slippery slope has brought us to?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, of lobby group 1stDoNoHarm. "You tell people it's okay to kill themselves, and that's what they'll do. You tell doctors its okay to let people die, and that's what they'll do. What's next? Murdering the learning-disabled or those with the wrong skin colour? Change the government's message, @@LEADER@@. Choose life."

3. "I sympathise with this man's situation," says neuropsychologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, showing no outward signs of being sympathetic at all, "but allowing suicide and banning euthanasia are both choices that are just running away from the bigger problem: chronic, intractable depression. We need a review of root causes, more mental health funding and a drive towards exploring experimental new treatments, like neuroaffective immunotherapy. Spend more on mental health and social services; cut other departments or raise taxes if you have to: this is a national crisis."

4. "Well, life is pretty damn pointless," says Nia Liszt, leader of a new movement calling themselves the [i]Self-Destructivists[/i], "so why don't we just end people's misery once and for all? We humans have had a terrible impact on the planet and suffering is inherent to life. You should donate some public money to my crowdfunded "kill-starter": I'm looking to engineer the perfect virus that will wipe out all human life forever. There's a little fine tuning to be done, but in the meantime, you can buy access to my existing research, which will probably help you develop some biological WMDs, or whatever else you like to occupy yourself with. I mean, who cares? It's all ridiculous, anyway."

[b][anchor=577]#577[/anchor]: Second World Problems [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Lenyo] [/b]

The Issue 
The ongoing ideological struggle between capitalist and communist nations shows no sign of letting up. At a meeting of 'second world' nations, opinions vary on how international socialism can be best achieved. The Party has asked you to put your weight behind one of the more popular approaches.

The Debate
1. "We're surrounded by a hostile camp of capitalist powers," lectures the borderline paranoid @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@ after preemptively surrounding her lectern with concertina wire. "The only logical solution is building a bastion of socialism impervious to any and all foreign aggression. @@LEADER@@, with closed borders and an ever-increasing military budget, we will finally be safe from imperialist encirclement."

2. "Come join the bloc party!" enthuses @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while handing out BBQ to everyone in attendance. "We need to form a Solidarity Pact, committing our nations to mutual defense and strategic cooperation. By sharing administrative functions and industrial investment, we can create a group of communist countries with steadily increasing living standards, and isn't that what socialism's all about? Who wants a kebab?"

3. "We have a duty to publicize the wonders of socialism," preaches socialist realist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ while coloring in propaganda posters with a red felt-tip pen. "People suffering under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie need to know that true happiness, by which I mean their class interests, lies with the worldwide proletarian movement. After all, winning the battle of ideas is far more important than getting stuck in another arms race."

4. "Hmmm, sorry what? I wasn't listening," says a rotund Party member with an expensive watch and the latest media tablet. "Perhaps we can get some sort of compromise between the economic benefits of private industry, alongside our ongoing socialist program. I mean, have you seen some of the cool stuff coming out of those capitalist countries?"

[b][anchor=578]#578[/anchor]: Support Your Local Arms Manufacturer [Golgothastan; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue 
After the Conglomerated @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Arms Syndicate announced yet another setback in the development of a promised new fighter jet, the Hell-@@ANIMAL@@ 3000, the Ministry of Defense is considering the previously unthinkable: importing from overseas.

The Debate
1. "You can't! If you cancel the order, we'll go out of business, putting @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ workers out of a job," pleads Conglomerated @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Arms Syndicate liaison, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We couldn't have reasonably anticipated the problems refitting the cockpit to make it windproof. We'll have the jet finished soon; I swear. In the meantime, maybe a generous contribution to your PR campaign would help convince you?"

2. Commodore @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Navy Chief of Procurement, is sick of the delays and cost overruns in the Hell-@@ANIMAL@@ 3000 project. "We were promised this plane three years ago, at half the price. This is getting ridiculous. It's time we found a supplier who can actually deliver on what they promised - even if that means importing from one of our overseas rivals."

3. "Why stop at fighter jets?" argues Colonel @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has recently returned from an officer exchange program with suitcases brimming with gadgetry. "We should be inviting all the foreign arms firms to come and bid to completely replace all the rusting junk our Armed Forces currently has to put up with. Just imagine our brave soldiers fighting with cutting-edge jet packs, thermal detonators, and knockout gas! Some would call importing supplies un-@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@; I call it progress."

*4. "Do you realize how many jobs that would cost, you blithering idiot?" foams union organizer Robyn Payne, diplomatic as ever. "Our arms industry employs people in every district, so you'd better listen to us... and if the fat cat bosses aren't running things well, then maybe it's time we nationalized! Under government control the factories will be churning out guns and ammo at twice the rate! And twice the price..." [[color=red]Must have Autocracy[/color]]

*5. "Do you realize how many jobs that would cost, you blithering idiot?" foams union organizer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, diplomatic as ever. "Our arms industry employs people in every one of your marginal electoral districts, so you'd better listen to us... and if the fat cat bosses aren't running things well, then maybe it's time we re-nationalized! Under government control the factories will be churning out guns and ammo at twice the rate! And twice the price..." [[color=blue]Must not have Autocracy[/color]]

[b][anchor=579]#579[/anchor]: Real Handwriting Has Curves [The Rejected Realms Issue Committee; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue 
"Concerned for Cursive", a mothers' advocacy group, have staged a mock funeral for handwriting - a practice which, they claim, nears extinction.

The Debate
1. "We are gathered here today to pay our respects to the memory of our nearly departed: cursive handwriting!" says head of the CFC @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "The government must act now. Require handwriting for all school assignments or watch our sweet and beloved cursive fall by the wayside like, err, stamp-collecting... and erm, the neighborhood milkman."

2. "I OBJECT!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, nosy parker. "We do that at funerals, right? 'Object'? But I object to this nonsense. It doesn't matter how kids are writing, but what kids are writing. We should be giving them free laptops to keep up with the times and stay competitive rather than keeping them in the dark ages!" 

3. "Nev'r understood what all them fuss was about 'andwriting," mumbles Deegan Holhs, an illiterate gravedigger. "Them schools should be teach'n kids the very basics. I nev'r needed to write nuff'n, so why should they? Quit that academic blither-blather and set our youngins up with them thar marketable skills."
