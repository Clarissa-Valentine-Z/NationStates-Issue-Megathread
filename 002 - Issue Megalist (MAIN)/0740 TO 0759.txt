The Issue
Ninety-three minutes ago, a hijacked bus laden with bombs was detonated in the lobby of the @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange. Ten minutes ago, with all of @@NAME@@ glued to their TVs in horror, the spreading fire caused the building's structure to critically fail and the Stock Exchange collapsed.

The Debate
1. "There's people trapped in the rubble!" shouts your driver, young Walter Lee, grabbing a crowbar, a shovel and a small red brick from the trunk of the car. "Emergency services are trying to get through, but traffic is gridlocked! Come on, boss, let's head there on foot! We can get digging, and maybe save a life or two!"

2. "Let's be level-headed here," suggests government aide @@RANDOM_NAME@@, emerging from the vehicle behind to pass you a comb, a breath mint and a diazepam tablet. "The nation is in panic here, and your duty is to soothe their nerves and appeal for calm. Let's get a press conference set up, and then a Crisis Co-ordination Centre. We can be much more effective if we remember that you're the nation's leader, not an emergency worker." 

3. "This isn't the time for press conferences, this is a war situation!" yells your bodyguard @@RANDOM_NAME@@, motioning for you to duck your head down to stymie any unseen snipers. "We're under attack, and we need to get you to safety. We've got to mobilise [i]now[/i], and get to a secure bunker. From there, you can declare a state of curfew and martial law."

4. "Yeah, yeah, another terrorist attack, what else is new?" dismisses your brother, while glancing at his watch. "Our dinner reservations are in the opposite part of town, and if we hurry, despite all this unpleasantness, I still think we can make them on time. Believe me, a building or two falling down is not worth missing this stunning rendition of Dàguó cuisine."

[b][anchor=741]#741[/anchor]: [color=purple][i]The Enemy Within[/i][/color]: We Can Work It Out [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive, Ransium][/b]

The Story So Far
Twenty-four hours ago a bus filled with explosives was used to bomb the @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange, destroying the building and causing significant loss of life.

The Issue
Preliminary reviews of traffic camera footage have revealed that the bus had on board a trio of suicide bombers who have been identified as disaffected young Violetists from a local neighbourhood, and who were vociferously in favour of "holy war" against @@NAME@@. It seems unlikely that they acted alone, so now you need to root out the mastermind behind this violent attack...

The Debate
*1. "The curfew has made both police investigation and maintaining order much easier," gratefully reports Chief of Police @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "but if we want to break open the support network of these terrorists, we'll need your permission to take a more robust approach. I'm talking about detention for interrogation of their family members and known associates, a low threshold of probable cause for initiation of investigation and freedom to act in the name of national security without being tied up with paperwork. Lose the red tape, and I'll get you truth." [[color=red]Must have curfew[/color]]

*2. "If we want to break open the support network of these terrorists, we'll need your permission to take a more robust approach," reports Chief of Police @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I'm talking about detention for interrogation of their family members and known associates, a low threshold of probable cause for initiation of investigation, and freedom to act in the name of national security without being tied up with paperwork. Lose the red tape, and I'll get you truth." [[color=blue]Must not have curfew[/color]]

[3]. "Data and data-processing are what we need here," claims social media guru Archie Meades. "I suggest crowd-sourcing your anti-terrorism efforts. Share what intel you have in the public domain: personal data of the suicide bombers, any video footage and basically anything else you can get hold of relating to that day. Then, let a motivated populace trawl through it and use their own ideas and creativity to collectively find the truth. Give me a lever long enough, a place to stand and one million unpaid volunteers, and we can move the world!" [[color=blue]Must have Internet[/color], [color=blue]Must have computers[/color]]

[4]. "If you want to find your culprits fast, I think I might have new software to help you..." suggests criminologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Link up the capital's CCTV feeds to my image machine-learning program and with a combination of phrenological face-mapping, gait-profiling and chromodermal analysis will tell you exactly who to arrest, and when." [[color=red]Must have Internet[/color], [color=blue]Must have computers[/color]]

5. "If we want answers, we need to get past the wall of silence," pleads social worker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Young men in the Violetist community get radicalised because they feel isolated, and frankly they just don't trust the police. Our cops need cultural sensitivity training. For example, did you know that Violetists are taught not to trust anyone not wearing purple somewhere on their clothing? We should be adding a nice indigo hatband to our police caps! Get them to trust us, and maybe they'll rat out their extremist buddies."

6. "If you want results, you ought to hire experienced professionals," offers Commander @@RANDOM_NAME@@, of Private Military Contractor [i]Shades Of Grey[/i]. "My group are experienced at urban operations, and we have a high success rate in location and resolution of insurgent and terrorist threats. We just need funds, and for you to look the other way while we do what needs to be done to get your answers." @@HE@@ places cable ties, sack hood and jump leads on your desk, and raises @@HIS@@ eyebrows suggestively.

7. "Hate to say it, but what you need here is good old-fashioned coppering, boots-on-the-ground police work, and maybe properly-paid overtime," offers Detective Sergeant @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "It's all about asking friendly questions, getting people to open up, and doing the legwork with no shortcuts. Not quite like [i]CSI: @@CAPITAL@@[/i] on the telly, but it's what works."

[b][anchor=742]#742[/anchor]: [color=purple][i]The Enemy Within[/i][/color]: And Your Bird Can Sing [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive, Ransium][/b]

The Story So Far
In response to a terrorist attack, you have granted extraordinary powers to those responsible for rooting out terror threats within @@NAME@@.

The Issue
A Violetist priest who criticised the national curfew and the government's response to recent events was arrested. He was then 'heavily questioned' for twelve hours, with a bucket of soapy frogs and a rubber wetsuit with the bottom cut out of it. Now free, the fellow is making noises about human rights and inherent dignity, while complaining about the 'advanced questioning tactics' being used.

The Debate
1. "It's not just that I was unfairly arrested," complains the limping clergyman, @@RANDOM_NAMEMALE@@, "but also that the whole approach being taken is not going to be effective. There's reams of evidence that torture does not work as an interrogation technique, and that the most effective form of questioning is a friendly and open manner, to encourage a cooperative attitude. You must ban the use of physical and mental abuse as a state tool of interrogation."

2. "Torture? Do not be a silly one, this is not the torture!" argues Interrogation Enhancement Specialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in oddly patterned speech, wiping @@HIS@@ knuckles clean with a silk handkerchief. "You can be thinking on it as an extension of the good cop, the bad cop. We use the gentle persuasion when we need to, and we use the not-so-gentle persuasion when we need to. A bit of the waterboarding, or the sleep deprivation, or the pain positions: none of these are the torture, per se. Do not be tying our hands in the red tape, or you will be compromising the nation's national security. You are caring about the nation's national security, are you not?"

3. "It's not so much whether it works as a tool of information gathering," adds Psychological Operations Chief Dr. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, "but also the broader effects it has on our overall approach. Engaging in punitive and permanent non-voluntary bodily modification and induced physical extremity magnitude reduction may not make an individual more talkative, especially in the surgically-induced absence of glossal musculature, ha ha... But the truth is we aren't trying to reach the individual. Rather, think of the extensive group psychological impact, the deterrence effect, and the fear we can instill on our nation's enemies! That is why we must do all we can to maximise our interrogation impact index."

[b][anchor=743]#743[/anchor]: [color=purple][i]The Enemy Within[/i][/color]: Here, There And Everywhere [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive, Ransium][/b]

The Story So Far
@@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange has been bombed by Violetist terrorists, but with no visible enemy to strike back against, frustrations are rising.

The Issue
Spoiling for revenge and impatient with the lack of results from police investigations, militant far-right groups have decided to take matters into their own hands. There have been reports across @@NAME@@ of Violetist citizens coming under attack from mobs keen to dispense midnight vigilante justice on anyone who shares the faith or culture of the terrorists.

The Debate
1. "We need to make it clear that we're not a nation that persecutes folk for their choice of religion," simpers flower-in-hair peacenik @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You need a public education campaign to encourage tolerance and diversity, and maybe you could personally visit a Violetist temple or two to show that we're all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ together."

2. "Sure, sure, peace and understanding and all that hoo-haa are lovely," mutters Army Sergeant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, "but we need a more direct solution to save lives in the here-and-now. Station armed troops in a ring of steel around Violetist neighbourhoods, and nobody will get in or out without our permission. We can also shoot down any fools who are there to cause trouble and simultaneously remind the local Violetists that we're keeping an eye on them, in every possible way."

3. "Seems like that would be punishing the victims of violence," worries Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Can't we just catch and arrest the vigilantes, and maybe put in stricter laws against hate speech and bigotry? Aim at those inciting violence, and the attacks will stop."

4. "We are merely being responsible citizens, assisting our government in cleansing the nation of Violetist influences," states self-appointed and black-uniformed Colonel @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ of the [i]@@DEMONYM@@ First Militia[/i]. "You should be endorsing our organisation, and applauding our efforts! No Violetists will escape alive!"

[b][anchor=744]#744[/anchor]: [color=purple][i]The Enemy Within[/i][/color]: I Want To Hold Your Hand [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive, Ransium][/b]

The Story So Far
@@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange has been bombed by Violetist extremist terrorists, but you've not let this get in the way of a policy of religious tolerance and peaceful co-existence with Violetist communities.

The Issue
Visiting a Violetist temple on the west side of @@CAPITAL@@ you're surprised to see your teenage nephew, Montague, at the temple and wearing the traditional purple skullcap of Violetism. What's more, he looks to be holding hands with an immigrant girl his own age, whom you realise is from the local Violetist neighbourhood.

The Debate
1. "Oh, hey..." greets Montague, looking a little worried. "Uh... this is Julie, and we've been kind of hanging out and we're kind of together now. Also, I'm... umm... converting to Violetism. Can we maybe just keep this on the down-low? I don't want her or me in the centre of a media circus."

2. "@@LEADER@@, it's an honour to meet you," says the Violetist girl, lowering her eyes deferentially for a moment, before deciding to meet your gaze. "If I may: I am not ashamed of my love for Monty, rather I am proud of it. If you want, we can be the figureheads for community integration for your campaign, so that all can see you as a leader who is close to minority communities."

3. "Oh... wow... uh, really... NO!" interrupts Civil Policy Officer Crupkey. "I mean, I got nothing against this in principle: my dad was an immigrant and my mum a local. But right now? When there's so much anti-Violetist sentiment? When we haven't even had the funerals of some of the bomb victims yet? These kids need to cool their hormones, and maybe start dating again in a year or so, when everything is calmer."

The Story So Far
Since @@NAME@@ suffered a terrorist attack in the heart of @@CAPITAL@@, you have been looking to unpick the support network behind the suicide bombers, and to identify the brains behind the operation...

The Issue
Success! Your chosen methods appear to have paid dividends, and your Intelligence Services have identified the terrorist ringleader behind the @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange bombings. What's more, you know exactly where his fortified HQ compound is. The only problem? It's deep within the nation of Blackacre, who historically haven't been too keen on @@DEMONYM@@ military actions within their sovereign territory.

The Debate
1. "This is a tricky situation," surmises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your ambassador to Blackacre. "I think we can make a deal, though. We can ask Blackacre to use their armed forces to engage and deal with this terrorist, and in return support a narrative that gives them credit for locating him. Also, maybe we could sweeten the pot by discreetly releasing those two Blackacre spies that we caught snooping around last year. Everyone wins!"

2. "We can't rely on Blackacre. After all, who is to say they're not in league with the terrorists?" questions Intelligence Director @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@. "Let's move in below the radar, and have plausibly deniable intelligence operatives carry out an assassination of the terrorist leader. We can claim we have nothing to do with his death, while simultaneously being sure that the threat has been neutralised."

3. "This terrorist has declared war on @@NAME@@, and he can't escape justice by sheltering within a foreign power!" asserts General @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, waving @@HIS@@ hands in the air, indicating that @@HE@@ does in fact care. "I'm going to need a rapid insertion force of paratroopers for a surgical strike on the camp, with a fighter escort to keep Blackacre from interfering. For The @@TYPE@@!"

4. "Sounds to me like every approach has downsides," worries your elderly mother. "Maybe you could just announce his location to the world, and hope that somebody else deals with him."

[b][anchor=746]#746[/anchor]: [color=purple][i]The Enemy Within[/i][/color]: There's A Place [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive, Ransium][/b]

The Story So Far
When the @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange was destroyed by terrorist attack, it was a blow to the heart of @@NAME@@. The terrorists responsible were identified, as well as the mastermind behind the attack. Now, the crisis is over.

The Issue
Time moves on, and most @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ have begun to drift back into their normal routines. However, for the families of the victims of the attack, the void caused by the absence of their loved ones will be felt for the rest of their lives. The site where the terrorists struck is now being cleared of rubble, and debate has begun over the future of the area. 

The Debate
1. "We need a memorial to those who died, and perhaps a plaque to thank the rescue workers who did what they could in this darkest of hours," suggests the mayor of @@CAPITAL@@. "Also, a Tribute Centre and a Memorial Museum. Money from ticket sales could go to the families of the deceased. We must never forget these events."

*2. "No. We can't let them think they hurt us!" asserts stockbroker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who lost several colleagues to the bombing, showing @@HIS@@ depth of grief by conducting half a dozen online trades as @@HE@@ talks to you. "The best way of reacting to terror is business as usual. Have a new Stock Exchange built, bigger and better than before, with faster trading connections and more computing power. Let's look to the future rather than the past." [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

*3. "No. We can't let them think they hurt us!" asserts stockbroker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who lost several colleagues to the bombing, showing @@HIS@@ depth of grief by flicking through a sheaf of share certificates as @@HE@@ talks to you. "The best way of reacting to terror is business as usual. Have a new Stock Exchange built, bigger and better than before, with a bigger trading floor and more telephone exchanges. Let's look to the future rather than the past." [[color=red]Must not have internet[/color]]

4. "The nation has suffered, but those of our faith have suffered more than the rest of you," states Violetist community leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If we want to move forward into a new era of inclusiveness and forgiveness, maybe the best way to achieve this is to establish a Violetist temple on the site. Allow us to show solidarity with the rest of @@NAME@@ by condemning the terrorists, and to atone for their actions through quiet prayer, community service and human sacri... uh... human kindness."

[5]. "Never forget!" yells right wing paramilitary @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Never forget that it was the toxic false faith of Violetism that led to this tragedy! I propose we use the site to establish the HQ for my anti-Violetist organisation, the [i]Brave Inquisitorial Guardians Of Truth[/i]. We'll use this as our centre of operations, to continue the hunt for hidden Violetists within the nation, and to wage war against them. [i]Let's make @@NAME@@ hate again.[/i]" [[color=purple]Must choose Issue 743's Option 4.[/color]]

[b][anchor=747]#747[/anchor]: The Plane Truth [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
You've just returned from a pleasant "diplomatic summit" on the tropical island nation of East Calypso. As your plane approaches @@CAPITAL@@ Airport, bright sunlight glimmers upon the foreign names and insignia on a variety of parked aircraft. Eventually, you see a few shabby tail fins with the Air @@NAME@@ logo. The woeful assortment of filthy fuselages and peeling paint barely looks airworthy. Is the national airline truly that pathetic?

The Debate
*1. While waiting for the airplane to reach the gate, you receive a call from Bryan Ringham, a management consultant and frequent flier. He doesn't waste time with chitchat. "Did you know that overhead at Air @@NAME@@ has seen a 380% increase over the last ten years? They won't be competitive with numbers like that. You could help them by eliminating all regulations that prevent airlines from charging for extra services such as seat reservations, checked bags, and clean drinking water. We can have a nice, lucrative budget airline here - and maybe even create some revenue for the shareholders!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. While waiting for the airplane to reach the gate, you receive a call from Bryan Ringham, a management consultant and frequent flier. He doesn't waste time with chitchat. "Did you know that overhead at Air @@NAME@@ has seen a 380% increase over the last ten years? You won't be competitive with numbers like that. You need to start charging passengers for all the services that are being given away for free, such as seat reservations, checked bags, and clean drinking water. We can have a nice, lucrative budget airline here - and maybe even create some revenue for the national coffers!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

3. As you disembark and enter the airport, you run into a group of flight attendants who are wearing the national airline's uniform and carrying protest signs. Their leader approaches you. "Your Excellency! Our working conditions are appalling. Air @@NAME@@ will never be able to improve if we're all working sixty hours a week for the industry's worst wages. Anyone who can get a better job with one of the foreign competitors like Maxay Pacific or Althaniq Airways has already left. Decreased hours and improved pay would do wonders for morale - meaning that we could serve the passengers better, of course."

4. Following this confrontation, your security detail ushers you through an employee break area to bypass the crowds. However, you are soon ambushed by airline manager @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Aileron, who appears to have packed @@HIS/HER@@ lunch in an airsickness bag. "Why don't we just ban all the foreign airlines?" @@HE/SHE@@ declares, while still chewing @@HIS/HER@@ food. "All of these outsiders are taking our people's money and sending it to our enemies! A true patriot only flies Air @@NAME@@, no matter how lousy the service is or how many times we skip routine maintenance - er, I mean, skip the needless luxuries. Without any foreign competition, we could keep every last @@CURRENCY@@ within our borders."

**5. Later, FlyerChat forum moderator 'Queen of the Skies' sends you a private message. "Air @@NAME@@ has nothing but disregard for its loyal passengers. First of all, the frequent flyer miles are useless. My most recent valuation puts them at only one-thousandth of a @@CURRENCY@@. Award availability is terrible, even with zirconium status. And don't get me started on the atrocious brand of caviar they serve in first class! This needs to be an airline that cares about its passengers, even if that requires huge government subsidies to bring it up to par. The first order of business is to change the elite mileage ratios to - hold on, I've got another troll who keeps calling us a bunch of nerds. Let the banning commence!"

[b][anchor=748]#748[/anchor]: [color=purple][i]The Enemy Within[/i][/color]: In Spite Of All The Danger [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive, Ransium][/b]

The Story So Far
When terrorists attacked the @@CAPITAL@@ Stock Exchange, many courageous volunteers braved the dangers of the ruined building to help search for and recover survivors from the rubble.

The Issue
The danger is long passed, and the site cleared, but there now appear to be multiple cases of mesothelial lung cancer and other serious respiratory ailments amongst the volunteers who attended the site at the time of the attack. Doctors are attributing this to exposure to toxic smoke and building dust.

The Debate
1. "Hard to... talk..." wheezes breathless patient @@RANDOM_NAME@@, struggling to be heard through @@HIS@@ oxygen mask. "We helped out... for @@NAME@@. Now we want... @@NAME@@... to help us. Healthcare... financial... support. Please, @@LEADER@@... please."

2. "Yes, yes, a lot of people have health problems for lots of reasons, it's terribly tragic," yawns clinical oncologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving the patient away. "The answer here is not compassion in a case-by-case basis, but a broader approach of socialised medicine, so that anybody who needs healthcare can get it when they need it."

3. "That's communist claptrap! It's not for you to spend MY taxes on other people's health," says @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, CEO of Panacea Private Medical Services. "Look, I will help these people out of my own pocket, for no reason other than that because I'm super-duper charitable and a really great guy! See? No government intervention needed, just free individuals in a free market helping each other out without the nanny state getting in the way. Three cheers for the free market!" He starts writing a cheque for 10 @@CURRENCY@@ for the cancer victim.

[4]. Walter Lee, your loyal driver, snarls at the CEO, hefting a small red brick at his head to scare him out of the room. "Um, boss... weren't you there at the centre of things, digging through the rubble? I reckon if you declare a six-month complete tax break for all people who were there at that time, that'd give people the cash to afford their own healthcare and show the nation's thanks for their goodness. And you know, I think you deserve a little something too, for being so damn courageous that day." [[color=blue]Must not ban cars[/color]]

[b][anchor=749]#749[/anchor]: Not Mushroom For Error [Bears Armed; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
Wild mushroom season is upon @@NAME@@ again, and as is traditional, @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ from all over the country will go out to gather nature's bounty. In recent years, however, there have been more and more deaths due to people mistaking poisonous fungi for harmless ones.

The Debate
1. "Ignorance is the problem," comments Mario Morchella, famed plumber and forest forager, passing you a peach he found near an old castle. "You should set up a system for training and licensing people who want to collect wild fungi, require collectors have the best field guide books, and ban any unlicensed individuals from mushroom gathering. Also, increase the number of park rangers, so these life-saving measures are properly enforced." 

2. "Quality is the problem," suggests @@randomfirstname@@ Cantharellus, one of @@NAME@@'s leading mycologists. "First, let's ban wild mushroom foraging. But also, we must increase funding for mushroom farming research. I know we can develop domesticated mushroom varieties and farming methods that would match wild ones for variation in type, good taste, and other desired properties. People can have their mushrooms and eat them without risking death too!" 

*3. "Greed is the problem," complains @@randomfirstname@@ Grifola, Under-Minister for Food Production. "They're the people's mushrooms. They should only be harvested by state agents, after which they can be checked by proper experts and then distributed fairly... with priority rationing for senior Party members, of course." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

*4. "Cityfolks is the problem," retorts Rural Association representative @@randomfirstname@@ Tuber, in his rustic dialect. "We countryfolk knows good 'shrooms from bad, all right. It's just townies coming out to take stuff without even a 'by your leave' that is getting theyselves into this here trouble. Let's keep 'em out of our fields and woods, where they doesn't belong no-hows, and then they won't end up deader 'n four o'clock. Oh, and we'll supply you with plenty of fine wild mushrooms for free iffen you wants 'em." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

5. "Mollycoddling is the problem," grumbles libertarian thinker @@randomfirstname@@ Amanita. "You should do away with this nanny-state system, and let people take whatever risks they think they can manage; and if they fail… well, then that's just Darwinism at work."

[b][anchor=750]#750[/anchor]: Cheerleading Community Does The Splits [Sanhon; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
When [i]East @@CAPITAL@@ High School[/i] denied a male student's request to join their cheerleading squad, they thought that was the end of it. Since then, the story has been picked up by the national media, with the boy, the cheerleading coach, and a spokesperson from [i]Equality @@NAME@@[/i] giving interviews about the controversy. Now, a gaggle of highly-opinionated and very-spirited individuals have entered your office, demanding your attention.

The Debate
1. "Give me an 'E'! Give me a 'Q'! Give me a 'U'-'A'-'L'! Give me an 'I', and a 'T', and a great big 'Y'! What's it spell? EQUALITY!" cries @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, doing an impressive backflip routine in his plaid skirt. "Every boy deserves an equal chance to live out their dreams, whether that dream is to cheer a mediocre football team, or be on a mediocre football team! You must force every school to allow any individual to join any team they want, regardless of sex! Why not? Girls are just as strong as boys, and we boys can be darn cute in these skirts!" Cheering your name, he cartwheels out the door.

2. "Cheerleading is for girls, and only for girls," asserts middle-aged former cheerleader and parent, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, as she attempts to perform a forward roll, but gets stuck underneath your desk. "Let the boys do wholesome boy sports, like football and boxing, away from our precious daughters! You know what teen boys are like: primitive hormone factories, only after one thing! Besides, with rates of sexual abuse on campuses already so high, you must prevent boys and girls having any contact in sport." She ceases her attempts to extricate herself from beneath the desk, gasping for air.

3. "You're both idiots!" thunders @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, his neck muscles straining against the collar of his camouflage shirt. "Cheerleading is stupid. It's not even a real sport! The funds wasted on girls prancing about could be used on REAL sports, that help REAL men to become strong and powerful! Taught by manly coaches, like me. Abolish this waste of money immediately, and pour the cash into useful, manly sports!" He punts one of your priceless vases into your equally priceless chandelier.

The Issue
A legal battle is raging between the [i]@@NAME@@ Department of Life, The Universe, and Environment[/i] and [i]Kay Rumble Property Development Group[/i]. While surveying for a luxury condominium complex, a rare @@ANIMAL@@ subspecies, the two-spotted glow-in-the-dark @@ANIMAL@@, was found traipsing around the proposed build site, potentially holding up construction.

The Debate
1. "I'm all for protecting truly endangered animals," grumbles @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the head of the housing firm, "but you can't walk ten feet in @@NAME@@ without tripping over @@A@@ @@ANIMAL@@. So what if these particular ones have a different spot on their underbellies or whatever? I'm trying to build houses for people - your people - and I keep running into red tape because of these damn hippies! We need to loosen these protection laws so I can get on with my job."

2. "But the three-striped, er... or was it four-toed @@ANIMAL@@, is truly unique!" squeals @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted environmentalist, while nursing a baby @@ANIMAL@@. "This subspecies is rare enough without these greedy opportunists destroying the only habitat they have left. These poor darlings need our protection. If an endangered species, subspecies, or genetically diverse population has been spotted, no form of molestation or habitat destruction should be allowed."

3. "With all due respect, you're huffing and puffing over a truly simple matter," chastens @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an amateur carpenter, while patting your shoulder gently. "We don't need to drive these creatures nor land-development to extinction. If we require developers create new habitat to replace whatever endangered populations they destroy, then everybody wins, don't they? I'm sure the two-spotted glow-in-the-dark @@ANIMAL@@ will adapt just fine to their new, man-made habitats."

[b][anchor=752]#752[/anchor]: The Immortal Cells of Mrs. Gratwick [The Atlae Isles; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Two generations ago, scientists took a biopsy of a tumor from a cancer patient named Elizabeth Gratwick, who died soon after. Without her knowledge or consent, these cells were preserved in the laboratory and proved to be exceptionally stable in replication. As stable cancer cell lines are highly useful for medical research, "ElGr cells" have been sent to and used by scientists all over the world. However, objections are now being raised by Elizabeth's descendants.

The Debate
1. "We thought my poor grandmother's remains had been buried in accordance with her wishes," growls Elizabeth's direct descendant, Catherine Gratwick. "Can't you let her rest in peace? This is [i]her[/i] body that you're messing with. You can't just irradiate and poison her; you must ask me first! How would you like it if your family's remains were exhumed and mutilated? You must never use cells from deceased people without the explicit pre-mortem consent of the patient or their relatives. As for granny - I insist that all remaining samples of her be buried, and that you financially compensate her family for the pain and grief you have caused!"

2. "No! ElGr cells are a scientific miracle!" cries biologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, jiggling a beaker full of purplish goop as @@HE@@ waves @@HIS@@ arms in exasperation. "These cells have been a breakthrough; not only in testing cures for cancer, but also in understanding how cancer develops and functions! All these years later, these cells keep chugging along, outliving all the others! Who knows, with these cells, we might even one day unlock a path to immortality! Are you going to let bureaucracy get in the way of SCIENCE?"

3. "This stuff is funny!" giggles your niece, squishing her fingers in the goop. "It's all warm, gluey, and bouncy! Someone should be turning out this stuff for kids to play with, or as sticky putty to stick posters to walls, or whatever. You've got, like, an infinite supply of it, so that's good economics, right?"

The Issue
Thanks to a marathon of military sci-fi films at @@NAME@@ High Command's recent movie night, most of the four-star generals and senior officers in the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ armed forces are abuzz with enthusiasm about next generation weaponry. In particular, there's growing excitement around the idea of [i]plasma weaponry[/i]: that is, the use of projected superheated ionized hydrogen gas to destroy your enemies.

The Debate
1. "PEW! PEW! PEW! Just think of the possibilities, @@LEADER@@!" exclaims Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@ [possibly fixed to Harley Rubio], an experimental physicist who has been seconded to your military, proudly displaying a clay model of a gnarly-looking plasma cannon. "We can make plasma flamethrowers, plasma machine guns, plasma ship cannon, plasma howitzers, plasma knives, basically plasma anything! With sheer firepower, we'd be able to overpower anything and anybody! We're... just a bit low on funding... so can you buy us the gear we need?"

2. "But this is going to be the hottest new thing," interjects @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of HydrogenScience Corp. "You have to let the private sector in on the profits! Just share with us any early data and blueprints you have, and we'll give your nation special discount rates when we sell plasma weaponry to the world. Oh, we'll also need permission to sell plasma pistols and rifles to your citizenry as well! The only way to stop a bad guy with a plasma rifle is a good guy with a plasma rifle: access to white-hot killing power is the fundamental right of every man, woman and child!" [[color=blue]Must have private industries[/color]]

3. "This stuff is far too unstable to be deployed as a weapon of war!" yelps pacifist physician and aid worker Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "For the good of the nation and international peace, you should be concentrating solely on the healthcare and industry applications of plasma and laser devices." @@HE/SHE@@ then proceeds to spray-paint a peace sign on your desk.

4. "I think we can compromise," offers grey-suited logistician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, looking worriedly over the latest prices of neodymium and high-output capacitors. "How about we simply stop this plasma weaponry research, and instead divert the money to buying tried-and-tested conventional weaponry?"

[b][anchor=754]#754[/anchor]: The Hit Parade [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]


The Issue
Two decommissioned satellites recently collided, the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ craft [i]@@ANIMAL@@-4[/i], and East Lebatuck's [i]Sputnak-3[/i]. In the aftermath, scientists have become alarmed over the possibility of [i]Kessler syndrome[/i], a phenomenon where the density of debris in space becomes so high collisions can have a domino effect, causing further collisions and debris. Using crayons and peanut butter, your aides have drawn you a diagram to try to convince you that this positive feedback loop could ultimately destroy all low earth orbit satellites, making space travel impossible for generations.

The Debate
1. "I have a bad feeling about this," warns famously handsome astronaut, Lieutenant George Kloonalski. "It's the same feeling I once had on a space walk while repairing a satellite, and that did not end up going well. But I don't want to bore you with my space stories, the point is, reforms are desperately needed to make sure collisional cascading does not happen. You should make sure every satellite launched in @@NAME@@ has high standards of safety and planning, most importantly having a plan for satellite disposal at mission's end. Given the gravity of the situation, I think these steps are unavoidable."

2. "Taking unilateral action is futile if other space-faring nations do not also act in kind," remarks mediator Carey Fissinger, well known for space shuttle diplomacy. "We need to immediately launch an international space debris summit to assure that all nations, not just @@NAME@@, properly regulate launched satellites. Given the dependence of modern economies on satellites, we shouldn't be afraid to use trade sanctions and other forms of political pressure to persuade all nations to agree to global regulations."

3. "But East Lebatuck started it!" whines @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your more petulant advisers. "[i]@@ANIMAL@@-4[/i] was just fine until that stupid [i]Sputnak-3[/i] hit it. We shouldn't have to do anything other than tell the world where we're putting satellites. It's up to East Lebatuck to move out of our way!"

[b][anchor=755]#755[/anchor]: Candid Camera [Noahs Second Country; ed: Helaw][/b]

The Issue
Outdoor survival expert @@ANIMAL@@ Grylls was being filmed in the latest edition of [i]Man Vs Wilderness: Untamed[/i], when he stumbled upon a top-secret military base that even you didn't know about. Not only did he discover the clandestine base, but he also broke into it - alongside his entire media crew - thanks to his shrewd usage of camouflage and bottles of urine. TV-broadcasted footage inadvertently shows highly-sensitive and confidential projects in the background of many scenes. With this in mind, you have decided to venture into a dark, smelly room in an isolated wing of the government offices to call a covert meeting.

The Debate
*1. "There can be no mercy," argues the gruff voice of the commander of the @@NAME@@ military, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We must publicly execute Mr. Grylls and his crew. No exceptions. The government should send a message to the public! You must show them that the state will hound them relentlessly if they are caught snooping around. Double the guards, double their weapons, double everything!" [[color=blue]Must not have prisons[/color]]

*2. "There can be no mercy," argues the gruff voice of the commander of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ military, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "We must imprison Mr. Grylls and his crew for the rest of their lives. No exceptions. The government should send a message to the public! You must show them that the state will hound them relentlessly if they are caught snooping around. Double the guards, double their weapons, double everything!" [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

3. "I, uh, I'm not so sure about the whole 'no mercy' thing," stammers a handcuffed @@ANIMAL@@ Grylls, with a concerned look on his face. "I mean, it's your own fault that we found it, right? If someone stumbles upon government secrets, y'should just let them wander on. Can I, uh, go now? I've gotta film an episode on those venomous pigeons by tomorrow."

4. "The solution is obvious," claims military strategist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "All we have to do is come out with all of the information stored in that base - false, of course. Then, we come up with some good lies to convince the public that these secret systems are something else. Do you think we could pass these rockets off as a fireworks display?"

5. "It's all too much hassle," sighs your Intelligence Minister, resting @@HER@@ head upon the meeting table. "You know what, @@LEADER@@? We should just tell them everything. No more secrets, no more hidden military projects. Release all of the government's confidential information into the open, and let them do what they want with it. Maybe we could crowdsource some suggestions for our new underground projects?"

[b][anchor=756]#756[/anchor]: The Issue With Issues [Maori Moon; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
After an influx of poorly thought out, redundant, and otherwise trivial issues have been shoved across your desk, concern has been raised as to whether the government should start better regulating the issues you receive.

The Debate
1. "There must be an issue crack down!" bellows @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your personal secretary, while removing gum off @@HIS@@ shoe. "If we don't do something, pretty soon we'll be getting issues that could have just as easily been dealt with the flip of a coin!" @@HE@@ pauses to discreetly move an old picture of your niece and her pet from your direct line of sight. "Let your staff take care of the frivolity so you can focus on the big stuff. In fact, if a government official passes on an issue that's too trivial to you, fire them on the spot!"

2. You suddenly hear a shattering noise and find @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Advisor Of Trivial Matters, has broken through your office window. "Sorry about that, your office door was being fixed," @@HE@@ apologies. "Anyway, an issues crackdown? Ha! Your window's a trivial issue, yet you'll probably be enlisting all of @@NAME@@'s government to replace it! I say, anyone who wants should be able to bring an issue directly to your attention! Then the people will feel like the government is a helpful organization working for them, not something big to fear! If that doesn't work, I'll even help fix your window!"

3. "There's no need to go to either extreme," ponders @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an intern and amateur vuvuzela-player who was just practicing @@NAME@@'s national anthem outside your window. "I have a creative solution: we should create a rigorous, 34-tier color-coded system to evaluate how @@LEADER@@-worthy an issue is and you can work through the issue queue accordingly. The people with most urgent and important issue will get a faster response. Everybody wins!"

4. "It's not the issues that you've got to watch out for, but the sorts of people that are giving you solutions," volunteers the bee suit clad Dr. Bees, walking hand-and-hand into your office with the Bird Lady. "I can't help but notice that some of the people who are giving you advice are a bit... odd. You just need to make sure that you're properly vetting all your advisors, then the actual decisions making process will be a snap, no matter how trivial or important an issue is."

[b][anchor=757]#757[/anchor]: Extra Credit? [Kingdom of Jacobia; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
A series of cases of mistaken identity from the credit bureau Expertfaux recently culminated in your young cousin receiving a deluge of petitions from aggrieved citizens. Frustrated @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@, who are beginning to doubt their own names, have called the efficacy and necessity of modern credit bureaus into question.

The Debate
1. "These people have no credibility!" protests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, littering your desk with the shredded ruins of @@HIS/HER@@ credit report. "Incompetent credit bureaus' background checks labeled Mr. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ as a criminal and Ms. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ as deceased. Besides, any attempt to boil down my life into a single number will fall short of doing me justice. Credit bureaus need more oversight, so they can't come between hardworking @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ and the loans we need!"

2. "These were minor mishaps," claims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a representative from Expertfaux, who appears to be addressing a government accountant instead of you. "Lenders, landlords, and even employers need our services to weed out undeserving clients. Imagine if companies didn't know who in the blue they were lending to! Credit bureaus must be allowed to self-regulate without government interference. The future of our wallets depends on it!"

3. "Doing background checks one at a time is so inefficient," muses the accountant in question, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why not put credit regulation under government control, and research people's financial history in advance? That way anybody can access our database at any time. I'm sure the police would love to have a record of major transactions and movements too."

[b][anchor=758]#758[/anchor]: Bye Bye to the Birdies? [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
After Smalltopian journalists reporting on recent protein powder trade negotiations penned more articles on @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ government buildings covered in bird droppings than international commerce, questions have been raised as to whether @@NAME@@'s "pigeon problem" has gotten out of control.

The Debate
1. "Get these damned flying rats off me!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@ Hitchcock, a member of the @@CAPITAL@@ Beautification Council, desperately trying to wave away the pigeons pecking at @@HIM@@. "These vermin are everywhere, defecating on us, spreading disease and damaging bronze and marble with their caustic droppings. It's all happening because a bunch of nutjobs are feeding them to feel good about themselves. @@LEADER@@, ban pigeon-feeding immediately, so we may be free of this feathered pestilence!"

2. "This is their city as much as it is ours,'' sings your childhood nanny Miriam Poppout, while staring at a snow globe with unsettling intensity. "You can't let these beautiful creatures die! We should embrace bird feeding. @@CAPITAL@@ will become known as 'The City of a Million Pigeons' and tourists will flock from across the world to see the birds and feed them at only two @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ a bag."

3. "I can't see what the fuss is about," chimes in B.F. Spinner, a spokesperson of the @@CAPITAL@@ Ornithological Society. "Ask any illusionist or postman you know: pigeons are highly trainable animals. If the problem is that they are pooping around, they can simply be given potty training. Just put small toilet bowls at designated spots in the city, equipped with a food dispenser that gives food pellets when a pigeon poops there. The pooping behavior will thus be positively reinforced and voila! - the next time the pigeon will go to the toilet bowl when it needs to poop. Problem solved!"

[b][anchor=759]#759[/anchor]: Marry, Marry, Quite Contrarily [Neocaledonia; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
The congregation of a local church of @@RELIGION@@ has come under fire after their refusal to wed a homosexual couple, inciting protesters to glitter bomb the pastor and congregants.

The Debate
1. "We should be allowed to marry whenever and wherever we want," insists gay rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If these people's 'God' is such a bigot, then maybe they should find a new one. Churches should either agree to conduct gay marriages or not be allowed to conduct marriages at all. You can't have one rule for straight folk and another rule for gay people."

2. "This is absurd!" exclaims Pastor Hal E. Looya, still picking glitter out of his hair. "You know what that very same woman said before gay marriage was legal? 'However much others may despise our positions on certain issues, we still have every right to live the life we want.' Now she's trying to force her beliefs on us! If the gays are that desperate to feel like they are 'married', they can find a church that shares their views or they can go to a public courthouse. Just leave us out of it."

3. "This is the logical result of government sticking its nose where it has no business," insists your libertarian cousin @@RANDOM_NAME@@, giving you the same line he does anytime you ask for his opinion. "@@NAME@@ shouldn't officially recognize or even provide tax breaks for any marriage, homosexual or heterosexual. Nor should it care if religions want to discriminate against various people for whatever reason. All marriages and religions should be treated equally, in the sense that they aren't being treated by the government at all."
