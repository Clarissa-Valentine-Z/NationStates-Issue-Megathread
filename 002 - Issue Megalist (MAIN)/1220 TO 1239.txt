[b][anchor=1220]#1220[/anchor]: Barely Any Art [Devil Heart; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Women dressed in @@ANIMAL@@ masks are barricading gallery entrances across @@NAME@@, protesting that women are often seen as nude subjects for male painters, but rarely have their voices heard when they want to be appreciated as artists.

The Debate
1. "The modern era's zeitgeist demands equal representation of the art of the male and female artist," complains a protester who is naked except for her mask, as she lounges in your chair and sips tea from a fur-lined cup. "Break the male gaze! Force galleries to equally represent men and women, both as artists and as subjects."

2. "Les femmes can not make ze art, zey ARE ze art, non?" comments a notable gallery director, who has not yet even noticed that the protester is wearing a mask, despite having been staring intently at her chest for the last ten minutes. "You must not be censoring us, non? Let us have la liberté in deciding what goes into ze galleries, eh?"

3. "I have a fabulous idea, fearless leader!" trumpets your Minister of Propaganda. "Patronise the best female artists with government contracts, and mandate that they be displayed in all galleries and public spaces. However, they should only be sculpting statues and painting portraits of the most important person in this nation... You, @@LEADER@@!"

The Issue
Junior Culture Minister @@RANDOM_NAME1@@ is thirty years your senior, but @@HE@@'s always had a twinkle in @@HIS@@ eye, a love of showmanship, and a certain lightness of step. It was therefore less surprising than it might have been when @@HE@@ declared that @@HE@@ had been approached to be a contestant in the hit reality TV show [i]Celebrity Jungle Idol Dancing Factor[/i]. Mindful that @@HIS@@ actions reflect on your government, @@HE@@'s asking your permission to go ahead with this.

The Debate
1. "I see this as a great opportunity to get viewers interested in politics!" @@HE@@ says, adjusting the crotch of @@HIS@@ sequinned leotard. "The viewing and voting public adore this show, and my going on there would be great for political engagement, great for government popularity and — I admit — great for the sales of my upcoming memoirs. It's just a bit of fun... You wouldn't begrudge me that, would you?"

2. "No, no, and thrice no! Have we lost all sense of decorum?" asks Party Whip @@RANDOM_NAME@@, trembling visibly at the thought of it all. "The mindless mob will mock us! This will undermine respect for the government and for your leadership! Frankly, this nation needs a better class of television programmes. Perhaps you could use tax incentives and subsidies to persuade the TV stations to stop running this lowbrow trash, and instead have an uplifting schedule of operettas, ballets, educational documentaries and the like? We'd be a culturally and mentally richer nation for it."

3. "We absolutely should let my honourable colleague make a fool of @@HIM@@self," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Spin. "In fact, we should make a point of directing our politicians to feature in mindless lowbrow drivel like this as often as possible. When the masses are laughing at us they won't notice as we tighten our grip on the country. Laughter breeds complacency, and complacency opens the door to control."

[b][anchor=1222]#1222[/anchor]: Family Matters [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The police report that several organised crime families have set up "neighbourhood tribunals" which offer mediation, judgement and punishment to their local communities in the absence of official courts. Surprisingly, many citizens seem to be in favour of these lawbreakers-turned-lawmakers, and willingly bring their grievances to them for arbitration.

The Debate
1. Without pausing for breath once, professional bagpiper @@RANDOM_NAME@@ drones @@HIS@@ reasons for turning to the illegal courts: "Basically, I lent my neighbour my lawnmower two years ago and he never returned it, and when I wanted it back, he said that he'd owned it for longer than me [i]and[/i] he'd been mowing my lawn anyway, so it was his, and I said that was rubbish, so he said 'so sue me' and I said 'you know there's no courts', and he said that it sucks to be me, and so I said 'well, maybe there is a court', and then I said 'capiche?' which means 'you know what I mean' but I was implying that I meant the Mafia, [i]if[/i] you know what I mean, and he said 'sure, let's do this,' so we did, and now he's sleeping with the fishes, which is [i]not[/i] actually what I wanted, but I had no choice, though if you reinstate some proper courts we could resolve legal issues [i]in[/i] a proper court, so that..." @@HE@@ faints suddenly, from oxygen deprivation.

2. "We're doing you a favour by dealing with people like that," says crime boss 'Actually Quite Thin' Tony. "Look, you got rid of the courts to get rid of bureaucracy and cut costs. That's something I'd appreciate as a taxpayer, if I paid taxes. Why don't you legitimise our neighbourhood tribunal system, and you'll get back a court system, but we'll be entirely self-funding. That's a win-win for everyone, wouldn't you say?"

3. "Perps cannot be allowed to take the law into their own hands," says police officer Joe De Redd, knocking the crime boss down with his police baton. "The system works. We the police, act as judge, jury and — if we see fit — executioner. We arrest, pass sentence and administer any punishment we choose, no matter how painful. Crime bosses, citizens seeking illegal arbitration, underground street lawyers — they all need to respect the law. I am the Law."

The Issue
The rising costs of the extravagant lifestyles of the royal family are causing great concern in the government.

The Debate
1. "I'm no republican, but this spending is getting ridiculous!" your beleaguered Treasury Minister exclaims. "Prince @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ flew a helicopter from downtown @@CAPITAL@@ to the @@ANIMAL@@ District, only five minutes away! And Princess @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ spent a fortune on dresses just for one royal engagement, changing six times over the course of one evening! Slash their funding! The monarchy can do without all the pomp and majesty."

2. "The grandeur of our royals instills pride for our institutions in the public," explains preening courtier @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The royal family must maintain a certain level of dignity and splendour in order to project mystique and status to the masses. What is the point of having royals if they're just going to be ordinary? We'd be mocked abroad for having a second-rate, cheap monarchy. That's bad for our international image. More money for the monarchy! A royal can't have just one diamond-encrusted toilet plunger, now can they?"

3. "It is true that we can't cut spending on the monarchy too far; it does need to have a certain grandeur to it," muses your Minister for Creative Solutions. "But I do agree we can't break the nation's finances over it either. How about we financially support only the major royals? You know, the monarch and, I don't know, the first three in the line of succession. They can lead their extravagant lives in their stately piles, but the more minor members of the royal family must support themselves."

*4. "Listen to all you idiots!" shouts ardent republican activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "What century are you all living in? We shouldn't be spending any public money on these damn parasites! One inbred family should not be able to live a life of privilege and luxury at the expense of everyone else.

[b][anchor=1224]#1224[/anchor]: Shine On, You Crazy Diamond [Verdant Haven; ed: Altmer Dominion][/b]

The Issue
What was supposed to be a celebratory occasion — the addition of a flawless (and enormous) new diamond to the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ National Museum — has instead turned into a national embarrassment. Independent experts have released a statement declaring the stone to be lab-created, casting doubt on whether the valuable display should be considered a 'real' gemstone.

The Debate
1. "This isn't my fault!" trembles gem curator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, responsible for approving the enormously expensive purchase. "The dealer assured us it was a real diamond! An opportunity like that only comes around once in a blue moon, so we [i]had[/i] to jump on it! There needs to be a law about this; imitation wares must be clearly labeled as knock-offs, going so far as to arrest dishonest sellers!"

*2. "That doesn't go far enough!" roars mining entrepreneur @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ De Beers, waving a diamond-studded cane wildly. "Just think! People buying luxury goods for low prices? These products are terrible for my bottom line — and the economy of @@NAME@@, for that matter. Where will your taxes go when every John and Jane can get anything they want for just a few bits? These lab-created diamonds, along with all knock-off goods, must be banned!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "That doesn't go far enough!" roars Division of Mining chair @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving this month's production reports wildly. "Workers buying luxury goods, at low prices no less? These products are terrible for the moral and economic future of @@NAME@ — in fact, this has the making of a bourgeois uprising! What will happen to our production rates when every John and Jane thinks they have risen above their fellow workers? Lab-created diamonds, along with all knock-off goods, must be banned!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "These gems really are fascinating," muses gemologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, examining a lab-created stone through a microscope. "The only difference between lab stones and the real thing is how these scientific marvels lack all of nature's flaws. To heck with pulling up rocks from the ground; we should dominate the international market by churning these out in the lab! Think of the boon to our economy when other nations see the quality of the stones we're 'mining' here! No need to tell them the real source, of course."

5. "This obsession with extravagance is unhealthy," admonishes noted ascetic @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Fake? Real? Why does it matter in the end? We must look to the soul of @@NAME@@, and pull back from this worship at the altar of luxury. Renounce riches, renounce commercialism, and encourage the people to do the same. Only in this way shall we reach enlightenment."

The Issue
Subversive groups are using pigeons to carry messages so that their anti-government activities can't be tracked by electronic surveillance.

The Debate
1. "Oh, for the love of all that is good and decent and @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@," says your exasperated national security adviser, rolling @@HIS@@ eyes. "What does it take to get it through people's heads that government surveillance is essential for their own protection? I suppose we'll have to search people's homes for pigeons, and arrest anyone found keeping them..."

2. "The potential and temptation for illegal communications will still remain," interjects Social Policy Director Thorpe Ests, taking a great leap forward to burst into the conversation. "We need to encourage all loyal citizens to kill any pigeon they see, and thus remove this subversive species from @@NAME@@."

3. "All brawn and no brains, as usual," says military intelligence officer and robotics enthusiast @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dangling what looks like a games console controller from @@HIS@@ hands. "These pigeons are just another mode of communication, and we should monitor this medium like any other. Let's equip drones with capture nets, so we can intercept the pigeons and read the messages before sending them on their way again. That way we can keep tabs on these unsavory characters."

4. There is a pecking sound at the window, and your secretary opens it, allowing a pigeon to fly in and deposit a note on your desk, which reads: "This country would be a much more pleasant place if we didn't have to choose between shoveling your government's waste or cleaning up bird droppings. People have plenty of legitimate reasons to criticize the government, so why don't you just let us do so, and maybe you won't have to clean the statues in @@ANIMAL@@ Park so often?"

[b][anchor=1226]#1226[/anchor]: Unintelligent Oversight [Valrifell; ed: Altmer Dominion][/b]

The Issue
A review of the national budget has revealed that the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Intelligence Agency has, among other things, been pouring millions of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ into the construction of an "interdimensional time-travelling microwave". Bewildered at the project, many government officials are accusing the department of wasting their funding.

The Debate
1. "What a load of hogwash!" exclaims your Minister of Defense, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, tossing a gelified banana onto your desk. "This is all they have to show for their work! Time travel, multiple dimensions, and super weapons for super soldiers: these are all fine comic book ideas, but utter nonsense for those of us who must live in the real world. It is clear that these 'intelligence' agencies have been given far too much freedom to operate. They ought to seek approval from you for all future experimental projects."

2. "Of course shut these projects down, but shouldn't we be talking about the question of accountability to the taxpayer?" snidely asks opposition leader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, entering your office for his daily argument. "It's probably your fault the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Intelligence Agency is wasting public money in the first place. I propose that [i]all[/i] significant financial operations of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE_INITIALS@@IA be overseen by an independent watchdog committee. It will be the fairest way to prevent future excesses!"

3. "Why are we letting an intelligence agency conduct any amount of scientific research?" snarls red-haired Chief Scientist @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Kurisu, furiously gesticulating over your desk while perilously clutching an open bottle of hydrochloric acid. "Isn't that what my team is for? If you ask me, you should just cut out the middle man entirely: stop funding the secret missions your intelligence agencies keep asking for and redirect those monies straight to the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ scientific community. Besides, it'll teach these 'secret agents' a valuable lesson — keep abusing your funding and you'll eventually lose it to those of us who can decide what matters most."

4. "Hold on a second," hisses what you could have sworn was just a regular office plant only a moment ago. "It's me, Agent @@RANDOM_NAME@@. I have good word that East Lebatuck has already perfected mind control shampoo AND conditioner. If we want to match this threat, you have to let us do our thing — which would be easier if you stopped breathing down our necks with spurious 'national budget reports'. It's time to truly go toe-to-toe with our rivals, one household appliance at a time."

The Issue
Bigtopian immigrant @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ was working as a domestic maid in @@NAME@@, and taking considerable liberties within her role, including: trying on expensive clothes, napping on the homeowners' bed and drinking straight from the milk bottle. These behaviours were brought to light thanks to hidden cameras installed by her suspicious employers.

The Debate
1. "The audacity of that girl!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dropping the soiled tissue @@HE@@ has wiped @@HIS@@ nose with onto your floor, assuming that it'll be picked up by someone later. "We gave that girl a job, and this is how she repays us? In fact, she should repay us! Every penny of the wage that she has been given should be forfeited and returned. This should be the case precedent, setting an example that working for the 'better classes' is a privilege, not a right."

2. "I've always said Bigtopians are filthy and deceptive," smirks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HIS@@ sickly grin repulses most people in the room. "Though honestly, I think we made a mistake letting these people into our country in the first place. Criminality runs in their blood, and we'd be far better off sending them all home. No more foreigners means no more problems, I'm sure."

3. "They spied on her with cameras?" queries @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a civil rights activist, as @@HE@@ turns on a tape recorder to record the conversation. "They could have been using these hidden devices to watch her undress, use the toilet and who knows what else. This blatant violation of privacy cannot be allowed — home electronic recording and broadcasting devices should only ever be deployed with the explicit consent of those being observed."

4. "These are bad people," offers the accused maid, eyes to the ground. "Many of my friend also have bad employer, @@LEADER@@, please allow us the right to quit a job and look for better employer. No more stuck with visa sponsor. I come work for you instead? You are nice person, I can be good maid for nice person."

The Issue
Your impatient and inattentive niece has, somehow, passed her driving test. With the roads of @@NAME@@ now feeling less safe than ever before, your family has come together over a celebratory dinner to discuss this matter in equal amounts of jubilation and trepidation.

The Debate
1. "What idiot passed her?" bemoans your sister, in a voice laden with maternal protectiveness. "I drove her to the test centre and saw everything. Her test had barely begun, when she had to consider a group of young school children crossing the street. She honked at them so furiously that they had to run to get across the road. Then, she took off so fast that she drove straight into a brick wall. Yet she still passed her test! @@LEADER@@, you must standardise driving examinations and test the examiners themselves against the same standards. Then there'll be less people like my daughter on the roads."

2. "Mum, that's so not fair!" squeals your niece. "Those school kids were like, deliberately walking slowly — wasting my time on purpose — I have a right to make them move more quickly. And like, what a dumb place to put a wall: right in front of a prison of all places! Anyway, the examiner, @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@, was like really cool; it turned out that we went to the same school and we had a really good gossip about Mr. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, our old Maths teacher. In @@HIS_1@@ opinion, if there were 'other reasons' to pass me, then @@HIS_1@@ professional judgement must be accepted. I have my license now, fair and square, kind of!"

3. "My little niece has a license now? That's so cool!" exclaims your brother, who is your niece's favourite uncle. "Hey girl, leave these squares to finish their dinner by themselves. Let's go for a spin in my car, you can drive, show me how you passed your test! In fact, we should show that sibling of mine that the government should do away with licenses altogether; learning by doing is always the best teacher!"

The Issue
With methamphetamine on (and in) the minds of many @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, law enforcement officials have suggested limiting access to meth precursor chemicals, such as pseudoephedrine, a common nasal decongestant sold in pharmacies across the country.

The Debate
1. "Drugstores are being taken advantage of, and what a darn shame it is," laments rural sheriff @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If we're gonna stop this methampheta-meltdown, we need'a restrict the sale of meth precursors. Doing so will stomp the brakes on meth makers, who require 'em in bulk to keep up their deadly production. A reasonable monthly limit and requiring a valid prescription from a licensed doctor ain't a bad idea, if y'all ask me."

2. "Seriously, you don't think I have enough work to do without being hassled by junkies for prescriptions?" complains stressed-looking family doctor @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Cough medicines and decongestants don't do much more than honey-and-lemon or steam from a bowl of hot water anyway. Just make all these precursors illegal, and crack down harder on recreational drug trade while you're at it."

3. "Restricting pseudoephedrine sales only hurts responsible, law-abiding citizens!" passionately exclaims Medical Rights Association spokesperson @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I'm no criminal, I just buy my meds by the metric tonne for my allergies, and a few extra as presents for my similarly allergy-stricken friends! Show some trust in @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, and deregulate these drugs!"

4. "I mean, the whole making meth at home thing is not as easy as certain TV shows would have you believe," complains your nephew, rapidly finger-tapping a repeating pattern because of his drug-induced OCD. "Why don't you just legalise methamphetamines, and users can then buy crystal meth from proper suppliers who know what they're doing."

The Issue
The quality of your meals has been quite lackluster lately. After some digging, it has been found that @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, an immigrant chef in your household, no longer has access to ingredients from @@HIS_1@@ home country, or any other country for that matter, thus depriving the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ palate of the tasty wonders of world cuisine.

The Debate
1. "It's such a shame we can't import anything from back home due to the autarky policy," sighs your Maxtopian chef, @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@. "There is so much good stuff I can't have nowadays. Like Snötballs, Barrybarf, and oh, what I wouldn't give to have me some good roasted Maxtopian pecans again! Can you please allow us to order little things from abroad? I'd love to get a taste of home again, and I'm sure you'll love it too."

2. "It's a pity our foreign residents aren't satisfied with our delicious, homegrown food," remarks native @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Master Chef @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "I must admit, when the autarky policy was first introduced, it was hard for me to source all of the best ingredients, but I soon figured out how to make do with what we have in @@NAME@@. You should fund some classes for the population teaching them how to cook with less. There are many appetizing dishes one can make with only @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ cabbage."

3. "Nein, ve must be able to accurately produce diese delectable foreign foods," insists diminutive scientist Plänk Ton, poking an illegally imported hamburger in a vain attempt to discover its secret formula.

4. "If they miss their native cuisine so much, then why don't they just go home?" an old @@MAN@@ complains. "We don't need any of their foreign muck which I bet tastes awful anyway! Importing food was a massive security risk, and now I think so is importing people. Send them all back to whatever war-torn hellhole they came from, and keep the doors shut!"

[b][anchor=1231]#1231[/anchor]: Save Our Souls [The Free Joy State; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Shortly after the secession of Gullivad — formerly the westmost region of Lilliputia — Ultra-Violetists seized control of all levels of the Gullivadian government amid a wave of surprising electoral landslides. They have enacted their strict interpretation of Violetist law, oppressing followers of all other sects and religions. As thousands of Gullivadians flee, converts to @@FAITH@@ — who are facing a violent crackdown — are pleading for intercession.

The Debate
*1. "@@LEADER@@, rescue us from the Ultra-Violetist terror," sobs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the leader of the Gullivadian branch of @@FAITH@@, hiding the pale lavender prayer beads that slip out of @@HIS@@ pocket. "Your missionaries saved us from the dread wrath of Violet's love. Please, allow all those who share your faith to freely enter your country. Those who accept @@FAITH@@ are your spiritual family and would be a wonderful asset for @@NAME@@. Do not abandon your spiritual brethren to despair, dismemberment and death by boiling." [[color=blue]Immigration is Legal[/color]]

*2. "@@LEADER@@, rescue us from the Ultra-Violetist terror," sobs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the spokesperson of the Gullivadian branch of @@RELIGION@@. "Your missionaries saved us from the dread wrath of Violet's love. I know immigration is forbidden, but I pray to our holy Vio... our Creator — sorry, recent convert — that you will graciously create an exemption to the ban for those who share your faith, and are in peril. Those who accept @@RELIGION@@ are your spiritual family and would be an asset to @@NAME@@. Do not abandon your spiritual brethren to despair, dismemberment and death by boiling." [[color=red]Immigration is Illegal[/color]]

3. "We could rescue these converts, cosset them and deprive them of growth," booms the religious leader of a well-funded congregation in West @@CAPITAL@@. "But is it not Written — somewhere in the back — that only in pain and adversity shall true faith blossom? These converts will never spiritually progress unless you make them march back to Gullivad, proudly professing their faith. Grant them the opportunity to experience the light that shines in the darkest night, the joy in every suffering. A true believer finds the Creator's purpose in every broken windowpane, shattered bone, and bloody execution. Allowing them that chance is the merciful thing to do."

4. "The practise of heretical faiths is now illegal in Gullivad," insists the leader of the recently elected Gullivadian Ultra-Violetist Council. "@@LEADER@@ — though you may be a loathsome maggot who permits @@FAITH@@ — you would surely not undermine an elected government? Proud Ultra-Violetist citizens voted for us to defend the faith. Yes, heathens are tortured, but only until they freely repudiate their false idols and love Violet, and they started it! Some missionaries' handbooks said to 'point and laugh at anyone wearing purple'! However, if given a regular financial incentive, we will kindly give the unbelievers of @@RELIGION@@ safe passage to Lilliputia proper."

5. "Gullivad is in real crisis!" cries the Minister of Disestablishmentarianism. "The children of the liberal Shrinking Violetist group are being stolen from their parents, Pastafarians are forced to slave twenty hours daily in the potato fields and the Faithologists have lost their tax break — okay, that was a bad example. We must open our arms and nation's borders to all those in need. Just think about all the prayers the government has wasted, poking our noses into people's private beliefs!

The Issue
Some time ago, a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ religious scholar named Bart Luthor incited controversy when he affixed his manifesto via a series of sticky notes onto the doors of prominent houses of worship. The bald cleric expounded 99 theological objections to the Way of the Light, many of which revolve around corruption within the faith. Now, his followers have taken to traveling across the nation, where their advocacy of 'reformed' beliefs has attracted a surprising number of converts.

The Debate
1. "The nerve of that man!" fumes your Spiritual Adviser, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Luthor is threatening our religious unity! His reckless preaching preys upon the weak-minded, dividing families and friends through his fraudulent faith. He is worse than a heretic: he's a public menace! For the sake of the nation, Bart Luthor must be persecuted, er, prosecuted at once!"

*2. "Thou shalt not position Luthor to claim martyrdom," recites historian @@RANDOM_NAME@@, reading off a scroll of parchment. "The false prophet's disciples close ranks, becoming nigh impenetrable to reason. Use this hour to mold @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ nature in thy stead!

**4. "I cannot believe what I'm hearing!" tuts your sister. "The @@NAME@@ I know tolerates all different backgrounds and religions. Who cares if someone thinks a little differently from you? Why don't you throw a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ Bart's way and go down to his congregation in a show of good faith? In fact, let's do the same for every minority religion!

**5. "I cannot believe what I'm hearing!" tuts your sister. "Maybe it's time @@NAME@@ began tolerating all different backgrounds and religions.

[[color=red]Must be theocratic[/color]]

6. "Fascinating," mutters one of your aides, while browsing Luthor's manuscript. "With all due respect, the guy makes good points. It's not like he's starting a new religion — he genuinely seems to want the best for @@FAITH@@. You should make Luthor your primary spiritual adviser and let him take a stab at the kind of reform he's asking for. Maybe he'll realize it's not that easy once he's pulling the strings."

Muckraking shows that exploit pain need to be banned, and replaced by shows that emphasise harmony and reconciliation."

2. "As a purveyor of high-quality programming, I tell the truth: that man is scum!" shouts McFly, pointing his finger in your face. "This loser is so reprehensible, his partner was driven into the arms of another man. I didn't mess up his garbage life, I just showed this mouth-breathing troglodyte to the world! This is journalism! Uphold our creative rights; don't silence our speech or bind us in safety regulations." Turning on a recording of people chanting his name, he exits.

3. "Shows like [i]The @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ Show[/i] exploit emotionally vulnerable members of society," muses clinical psychologist Dr. W. Ordy, best known for the critical thesis on untrained media personalities, [i]Pop Psychologists: Stating the Bleeding Obvious and Getting Paid[/i]. "They have little interest in protecting the people who participate, often haranguing them until they take part, employing cheap shock tactics. Reality shows must be obliged to ensure all participants are mentally fit and supported by trained psychological professionals, and provide full aftercare."

4. "Participants on those shows beg for ridicule," snorts your brother. "Oh, my partner doesn't love me. Oh, I don't like my haircut. Oh, dear, I'm dying. Wah-wah! But, picture this: [i]@@LEADER@@'s Court[/i]! A new talk show, starring us, and forcing whoever we want to humiliate to feature as victims. You would expose and arbitrate their worthless lives, and whoever we didn't like would be ridiculed. Say someone once said something bad about you? Bam — they're trash, booed into submission by a pre-selected audience. Citizens will soon learn that it's safest to automatically agree with you."

[b][anchor=1234]#1234[/anchor]: I Declare a Thumb War [Verdant Haven; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A long-lost treaty with the aboriginal population of @@NAME@@ has been recently and conveniently uncovered, guaranteeing the right to settle legal cases by the traditional means of Thumb War. Documents in hand, Elder @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ 'Finger Crusher' @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@ is seeking to settle a longstanding real estate ownership dispute with a frail and arthritic CEO in the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ industry.

The Debate
1. "For too long, my people have been denied our rights to this valuable land, and the economic power it brings," @@HE_1@@ roars, working an enormous exercise band with @@HIS_1@@ equally enormous thumbs. "You must respect our rights, and prove that your government is honorable. Tell you what, rather than deciding government policy with debates and chatter, why don't you stick out that puny thumb of yours, @@LEADER@@, and let's get this over with. I promise not to humiliate you... much!"

2. "Now hold on a moment!" interjects General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of an eccentric military research branch. "We shouldn't thumb our nose at this treaty, but see how it doesn't specify who they face off against? My office has been secretly developing a mechanical exo-suit, and it's time to field test our new Mega Glove! I bet one of our soldiers would make a great champion!"

3. "Who's got two thumbs and a money making idea? This guy!" enthuses television executive @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, pointing at himself. "Instead of tying up the real courts with this sort of thing, let me make a legally-binding reality-sports-procedural show out of it! Think of the viewing numbers! Everybody will tune in to see if the plucky bar-room thumb wrestler can train enough to overcome the mighty hands of big business lawyers over the course of a season... no, two seasons! Oh, the montages we'll have!"

4. "Whoever wrote this must have been all thumbs... I don't think our government can really be held accountable for it," weasels your Minister of Exceptions. "It's so badly written, I practically need a translator to read it! Just tie it up in court with endless challenges to what each word means — I'm sure it'll get thrown out eventually."

[b][anchor=1235]#1235[/anchor]: Good Guy With a Gun [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Marsupial Illuminati][/b]

The Issue
A gunman took to the mall and shot dead three people before a nearby coffee shop waitress dispatched him with five rounds from her automatic pistol. Unfortunately, as she stood over him gun in hand, a mall security guard thought she was the threat and took her out with his submachine gun. He in turn was shot by a libertarian who thought the state was finally coming to take his gun away. By the time the police arrived (and gunned down more would-be heroes who they had mistaken for terrorists), the death toll had reached fifty-seven.

The Debate
1. "Personally, I call that a win," exalts @@CAPITAL@@ Rifle and Revolver Association representative @@RANDOM_NAME@@, firing a round into the air in celebration. "I mean, how many people would the initial gunman have killed if nobody had stopped him? More than fifty-seven, that's for sure. More guns equals more safety. Maybe the government ought to recognise that by picking up half the cost of every gun purchased. Oh, and uh... thoughts and prayers to the families of the deceased and all that, yada yada."

2. "Hell, yeah!" agrees Sheriff @@RANDOM_NAME@@, spinning and holstering @@HIS@@ sidearm, and accidentally discharging a round into the floorboards. "Though, y'know, maybe more gun discipline would help. People who use guns should be forced to attend training seminars run by responsible and well-paid local sheriffs. That'll help them to learn target discrimination, gun safety and all that. And... uh... yes... what a tragedy... our hearts go out to the bereaved."

3. "Let's face it, the problem here wasn't the shooting — it was the powerful weapons being used," asserts one of the victims, rubbing @@HIS@@ injured derrière. "I mean, if the gal who shot me hadn't been on full auto, she would never have accidentally zinged me. If we just restrict selective-fire weapons, magazine extensions, and barrel shrouds, that should do it. Wholesome guns don't kill innocent people. Only assault weapons do that."

4. "Uh, we could try not letting people have these devices designed to murder and maim," ventures a long-haired hippy, insensitively disrespecting the dead by launching into yet another tirade of typical freedom-hating, commie, anti-gun ranting. It's possible @@HE@@ has more to say on this, but to be honest, no-one's listening.

[b][anchor=1236]#1236[/anchor]: Being Honest [USS Monitor; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A politician is attempting to have his name legally changed from Harry Butts to Honest Joe Johnson so it will look more appealing on the ballot, but his opponents are crying foul.

The Debate
1. "This is an obvious ploy to manipulate voters," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a candidate from an opposing party. "People shouldn't be allowed to change their names. It's too easy to abuse and all it does is confuse people."

2. "It's my name, and I should be able to change it to anything I want," Mr. Butts says with one of those plastic camera-ready smiles that politicians always seem to have. "I just want my name to reflect who I really am. As for the election, I'm sure the voters can be trusted to make the right decision."

3. "I'd trust that guy about as far as I can throw him," says transgender rights activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "He's obviously trying to game the system and you shouldn't allow it, but there are some people — like myself — who have legitimate reasons to change their names. You should let normal folk change their names, but force politicians to use the names that they were given when they were born."

4. "Hey, what if we took this a step further?" says @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ @@MOTTO@@ @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, one of your party's more creative campaign strategists and successful parliamentarians. "As we're listing names on the ballot, why don't we have all our party's candidates change their middle names just before the election to emphasise our key policies. We can use that space like a miniature campaign poster. Like my name, for example, would be Elsa 'Friendship ; Cow ; Moo' Bone. How could people resist voting for that?"

[b][anchor=1237]#1237[/anchor]: A Polar Bear's Tale [Australian rePublic; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
An anonymous caller recently asked the police to break up a party at @@ANIMAL@@ City Beach, citing an ancient law that states: [i]'Goers unto the coast must be accompanied by an ursine beast of white fur'[/i]. This antiquated statute, leftover from long ago, after an influential courtier had trouble selling two dozen imported polar bears, was never rescinded. A re-examination of the many frivolous and archaic laws that are hidden within the nation's legislative archives has found its way to you.

The Debate
1. "This is a stupid law!" complains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was interrogated by the police during the incident. "I was questioned for half an hour because I didn't have a polar bear! Where am I supposed to find a polar bear? I've done some reading up on these old laws: did you know that in the district of West @@CAPITAL@@ it's illegal for ladies to go out on Saturdays with a non-matching watch and handbag? These laws are foolish, and you should get rid of them."

2. "You can't be serious!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your secretary, who's wearing goggles because @@HE@@ is within 50 cubits of a fire hose, a law that applies only to the inside of Parliament. "We can't go around erasing all these half-witted laws — that would be way too much administrative work! We should just issue guidelines to our police officers, advising them to use their discretion about whether to enforce these laws."

3. "Excuse me, but you seem to be forgetting that these people broke the law," reminds goggleless Chief of Police @@RANDOM_NAME@@, taking care to stand 51 cubits from the fire hose. "I don't care how 'stupid' you think it is: the fact of the matter is that these people disobeyed the law! Sentence them as they would have been punished when these laws were written!"

[b][anchor=1238]#1238[/anchor]:  No Shoes, No Service [Sacara; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The rise of the Barefoot Wanderers, a newly formed religion, has led to an increasing number of people going about their daily lives without shoes or socks on. @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, famous movie star and new convert to the religion, recently made national headlines after @@HE@@ was forcibly removed from an uptown restaurant for @@HIS@@ lack of footwear.

The Debate
1. "This is discrimination in its dirtiest form, just like in my upcoming movie, [i]Faith Laid Bare[/i]," raves @@LASTNAME_1@@, pointedly resting @@HIS@@ dirt-caked feet on your desk. "It says in our most sacred texts that covering toes is giving service to the Sock-Devil. Being forced to wear such abominations is oppressing religious freedom! Besides, look at these toes, just look at them. Ain't they beautiful?" He wiggles them under your nose.

2. "Would you really want to dine in an establishment that smells of uncovered feet?" counters restaurateur @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ pan-fries a durian and Surströmming fritter. "We have a sign that clearly states our 'No Shoes, No Service' policy, and that is for the enjoyment of all the people that we serve. Businesses should be able to enjoy the right to refuse service to anyone they wish — they're our own restaurants, after all."

3. "Bl-euch! These foot-worshippers and toe-fetishists make me sick!" gags your Minister of Standards, adjusting @@HIS@@ pink-and-green three-piece suit and yellow suede brogues. "I say that allowing people to dress so sloppily is ruining the very fabric of @@NAME@@! You must demand that everyone should wear smart shoes at all times when in public. It's about professionalism and decency, don't you know?"

[b][anchor=1239]#1239[/anchor]: The Walking, Talking, and Irritated Dead [Window Land; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
Seven years ago @@RANDOM_NAME@@ went missing after a yachting accident, and has since been declared officially dead. However, @@HE@@ recently re-emerged and came back to @@NAME@@. Despite showing up in person to get @@HIS@@ death certificate reversed, @@HE@@ found @@HE@@ could not do so. @@HIS@@ mortician has come to complain to you on @@HIS@@ behalf, as corpses aren't allowed in the building.

The Debate
1. "It seems silly to me that my corpse... er, I mean patient, is still considered dead," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the mortician of @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, as @@HE@@ pushes a gurney with a covered and very life-like mannequin on it. "If somebody who has been declared dead shows up and gets an examination, the doctor should be able to change their legal status to living."

2. The mannequin suddenly sits up, revealing itself to be @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@, who was also declared legally dead after getting lost in the rain forests of Macronesia ten years ago. "Being dead isn't all bad, I suppose. There are no taxes, my family got an insurance pay-out... I guess it's kind of fun to be a 'zombie'! You should just let me stay legally dead. People like me, who officially 'don't exist', can't claim any government benefits, so you guys get to save some money too."

3. "I may have made a mistake, but after seven years it's reasonable to presume someone isn't coming back," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the registrar who made the death of @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ official. "Of course @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ is still alive and should be registered as such. Therefore, @@HIS_1@@ family should be made to return their insurance pay-out, and @@HIS_1@@ last will and testament needs to be scrutinized to see if they received any other benefits from @@HIS_1@@ death."

4. "You know, maybe @@RANDOM_NAME_2@@ is on to something," says your Minister of Necromancy, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Maybe we should create a task force of legally dead people to eliminate dissenters. We can deny their existence easily because they're all dead, and if anybody tries to blow the lid off it, they'll just sound like a crackpot who believes children's stories!"

5. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! ZOMBIE!" screams your young and excitable niece. "KILL IT, KILL IT, KILL IT, KILL IT, KILL IT, KILL IT, KILL IT, KILL IT!" Your sister comes in to try to calm the hysterical girl down, as she shouts over the screaming. "Seriously though, if the government says people are dead, they ought to ensure it."
