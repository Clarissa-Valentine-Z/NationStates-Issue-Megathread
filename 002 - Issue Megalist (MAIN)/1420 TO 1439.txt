[b][anchor=1420]#1420[/anchor]: Trading Climate Sours [Refuge Isle; ed: Noahs Second Country][/b]

The Issue
Your refusal to sign a landmark climate treaty has resulted in bitter trade relations with some of the countries who did sign it. A number of imported items have run out of stock nationwide, causing them to be replaced with odd substitutes, which are now also out of stock. Upon realizing that the pitcher formerly containing luxury mangosteen juice is instead a strange concoction of vinegar and pineapple extract, everyone at the table is now looking at you with distaste.

The Debate
1. "So it has come to this!" cries Naomi Berenstein, your Minister of Health and Safety, armed with several bandoliers of vitamin C supplements. "Just go back to Brancaland and say that you didn't SEE the treaty. Of course we would have signed it if only we had known! Though you may want to suggest some... minor amendments, to say the least." She hands a quantity of flaxseeds and a jar of applesauce in a 2:1 ratio to you. "For luck."

2. "First they tell us to bankrupt our country by making reforms that we can't afford, and now they're trying to make sure we'll stay poor by cutting off our trade?" roars your Minister of Commerce, Wally Guterres, writing with a series of crudely whittled charcoal sticks. "We just need to find new trade partners. If we set all the terms, we can end this acrid drought and continue to run on what has made the world's economy work for centuries. Items like coal, oil, plaster sculptures of your face — and now there's even less competition for all three!"

3. "I knew this would happen ever since the man on AM radio said it would," grumbles retired military officer Bongani Nelson, unfolding his wrist watch into cutlery before attacking a thirty-year-old survival meal kit. "Treaties are just how the globalist elite get you to turn over your sovereignty. If we need something, anything at all, we should make it ourselves! Let's start making our own products straight from Nosaman soil, even if they don't grow here, even if they don't grow at all!"

The Issue
Avery Phillips, a young dancer, recently collapsed with the complications of what was revealed to be anorexia nervosa while dancing in the small, televised role of 'Girl Waiting for Pater Maxxmas'. National attention has now been drawn to the growing prevalence of eating disorders and related hospitalizations in @@NAME@@, especially among the dance community.

The Debate
1. "Here's some food for thought," says psychologist Des Carter, handing you a copy of his new book [i]Cogeato Ergo Sum: I Eat, Therefore I Am[/i]. "Eating disorders are growing year on year, in both male and female @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@. They may be the result of low self-esteem, body dysmorphia, or can be comorbid with other psychological disorders. Due to the high morbidity, it is vital that you subsidize psychiatric in-patient treatment and prevent future eating disorders by encouraging citizens to attend government funded therapy. Now, why don't you lie down on this couch and tell me how you feel..."

2. "Wake up and smell the coffee!" cries Honey @@RANDOM_NAME@@, mother of the collapsed teenager. "The true cause of these eating disorders is all the pressure in today's hypercompetitive, ultra-connected world. Every member of the @@CAPITAL@@ Ballet [i]corps de ballet[/i] has a teeny-tiny waist and skinny legs, and it's ridiculous! My poor child felt she'd never be pretty unless she was severely underweight. Sponsor media promotions of more healthy body proportions, and ban anyone who's simply too thin from working in sport, dance, or any role where they can be seen by vulnerable youngsters!"

3. "Please, dar-link, this 'healthy figure' is so last season," scoffs cadaverous fashion magazine editor Karla Field, covering the downy hair on her emaciated arms with her plum suit's sleeves. "Only flabby mummies who stuff their faces with fatty snack-foods object to skinny women, because they feel inferior knowing their own beautiful bones were swallowed by layers of flesh. That's not our problem. Women who eschew the ravages of food should be praised, not labelled mentally ill. My magazine will even fund a contest to crown [i]Miss Mosquito[/i] — the thinnest, most dietetically controlled woman in @@NAME@@ — [i]and[/i] provide you with something to replace that monstrosity you're currently wearing. How about it?"

4. "The obvious solution to eating disorders is to ensure every @@DEMONYM@@ gets the right calories and nutrients," interjects your Minister of Health, Lettuce @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "And how? With a simple law requiring that every citizen eats healthily and to the exact amount required, enforced by monitoring eyes in kitchens, regulated mealtimes, government distributed shopping lists and recipes and 'clean plate monitors' to help everybody finish their din-dins... even if they don't want to. As the icing on the cake, this would also allow us to prevent people from becoming overweight. Of course, it'll require a lot of oversight, and control of the national food supply, but my department can handle it."

The Issue
It's a terrible day. Woken early from dreams of joyfully frolicking @@NATIONALANIMALPLURAL@@, you are dragged to the naming ceremony of the latest @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Navy ship. Lashed by more rain than an Albionian could cope with, the sky is the same steely grey as the oversized hulk of metal everyone is making a fuss about, and thanks to the woolen kilt your advisors insisted was "traditional", the wind is whistling right where you don't want it to. You thought it couldn't get any worse, but just as you grasp the ceremonial bottle of bubbly and utter the words, "I hereby name this ship..." you realise you have no idea what the damned thing is to be called.

The Debate
1. One glance at @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, your Minister for Creative Solutions, tells you @@HE_1@@ won't be any help today. For once bereft of ideas, @@HE_1@@'s studiously avoiding your gaze by pretending to examine a spot off on the distant horizon. What would get @@HIS_1@@ goat? Ah, of course — a cold, efficient and utterly unimaginative name.

2. To @@HIS_1@@ right is the perpetually nervous Religious Affairs Minister, @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_2@@, fiddling with @@HIS_2@@ prayer beads as @@HE_2@@ considers @@HIS_2@@ many religious affairs. You can just imagine @@HIS_2@@ reedy, patronising voice telling you to name the ship after a devout godly figure. Of course, there's some @@HE_2@@'d prefer to forget — who was that patron saint of altar boys?

3. Resolutely staring past your left shoulder is the ever-pompous Rear Admiral @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_3@@. What would wipe the smirk off @@HIS_3@@ meaty jowls? Perhaps a dashing, daring name of old, like "Warspite" or "Thundercracker". But with a twist...

4. And of course there's your office intern @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_4@@, looking smugly right back at you. Of course @@HE_4@@ knows just what the ship should be called, but all @@HE_4@@'s mouthing at you is "Shippy McShipface" — or at least you hope that's what it is. Oh, to hell with it. Who says you can't name a ship after yourself?

[b][anchor=1423]#1423[/anchor]: A Slice of the Pi [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Recently, a tech firm from the United Federation used a network of computers and the latest algorithms to calculate pi to an incredible number of decimal places, smashing the previous world record by several orders of magnitude.

The Debate
1. "We can break that United Federation record right here in @@NATION@@, I know it!" exclaims excitable mathematician @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, dancing around you with a manic look on @@HIS@@ face. "All we need is a great big network of super-computers, with customised software, and a year or two of dedicated runtime. I've got some ideas for exciting new formulae that will make Chudnovsky look like a chump. I mean, what could be cooler than mathematics and computer programming?"

2. "Look, the pursuit of a list of numbers is just academic frippery and posturing," moans knitwear-clad structural engineer @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "Even physicists don't bother using values of pi to more than 160 decimal places, so there's no practical purpose here. Government research and academic subsidies should be focused purely on subjects which have real-world applications and a sound case for projected economic or societal benefit. You know, like my underfunded research on drainage applications of composite 3D-printed concrete micro-structures with resin polymer interior scaffolding. It's really fascinating stuff. Here, I wrote a paper on it..."

[3]. "Nerd alert!" yells former high school quarterback turned fry chef @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shoulder barging between the two previous speakers, and knocking them to the ground. "Yeah! Feel that impact!

School of hard knocks, that's the lesson plan these weaklings need!" @@HE@@ demonstrates with @@HIS@@ fists. [[color=blue](TBC) Must not ban Sports[/color]]

4. "Honestly, I've never liked pi. It's just so... irrational," says Minister of Mathematical Certainty Eddie Goodwin. "Can't we just legislate so that everybody in @@NATION@@ uses a @@DENOUNYMADJECTIVE@@ definition of pi? Let's just say pi is 3.2. I mean, that's true anyway for a given curvature of space time. Just say 3.2, and leave it at that, eh?"

[b][anchor=1424]#1424[/anchor]: Here's Looking at Zoo, Kid [Socio Polor; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
Following the abolition of zoos, an ecological report has found that a large proportion of released zoo animals have not survived in the wild because they spent most of their lives in captivity.

The Debate
1. "I totally saw this coming," asserts a pair of talking giraffe's legs, who you realise is actually the former director of the @@CAPITAL@@ Zoo wearing a giraffe costume on stilts. "It's a sad scene, isn't it? Those poor giraffes alone in the wilderness with no way of defending themselves from predators like those supercilious tigers. The public are understandably mad that these exotic animals have no chance of surviving in the wild. The answer is simple: let us recapture all of our animals to save them from themselves and we'll re-exhibit them once more."

2. "If you knew this would happen, then why didn't you prepare the animals before their release?" questions the notoriously catty Secretary of Wildlife Conservation, Beryl Caskin. "Training and rehabilitation are what we need here. We'll get our people into the wild to hone these animals' survival instincts by demonstrating to them the behaviours that they will need to survive. For example, we could teach tigers how to stalk their prey or giraffes to whack would-be predators with their necks. A film crew can even follow us around, which will raise public awareness on wildlife conservation without the need for zoos."

3. "Any human intervention is too much human intervention," says Konrad Scheer, the head of the Special Protection of Animals Movement. "Besides, the government should be focusing on highly endangered animals such as the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ horny toad. Can you believe there's only twenty of them left? We can't risk their extinction. It would be nice if we instead left endangered animal species alone in their own protected reserves, away from other animals, with a never-ending supply of food."

The Issue
In the midst of another busy day, you trip on a misplaced paperweight and tear your favorite pants on a nail haphazardly jutting out of your office's door frame.

The Debate
1. "Oh, this just won't do!" tuts your aunt, an aspiring seamstress, holding two giant off-color swatches against your torn pants leg. "I'll get this fixed right up, dearie! A few patches here and stitches there and they'll be as good as new! Sad that so few people make-do-and-mend these days. Now, pass me your little pants."

The Issue
A recent top division women's football match set the lowest all-time attendance record of just five people.

The Debate
1. "Women's football is losing the federation a lot of money," sighs @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Football Federation president Seth Blather as he polishes his pricey Spinex watch. "It's a catch-22. No one wants to watch women's football because it is lower quality, but we can't invest in player development without a paying audience. The whole industry will collapse without government funding. We'll use the money to develop grassroots sport, hire professional managers, and fund executive team incentives every time we meet ambitious targets such as doubling attendance in women's matches. What were the attendance numbers again?"

2. "The government should discourage girls playing boy sports and the other way around!" suggests an acne-ravaged teenager, who has enough oil on his face to justify an invasion from the United Federation. "For example, football and @@ANIMAL@@ball are for men while beach volleyball and foxy boxing are for women. After all, nobody's going to pay to watch tomboys playing a man's game or some effeminate blokes throwing around a netball like an idiot."

3. "Why don't we force professional sporting leagues to schedule men's and women's doubleheaders for every match?" proposes your Minister of Alternative Solutions, who is scrubbing the office toilet with a sponge attached to a drill after he used your toilet brush as a replacement for a missing door stop. "That way, we'll fix the attendance problem, men and women can split the revenue equally, and sports fans get double the action! What could go wrong?"

All hail @@LEADER@@! As the nation enters yet another period of unbounded success, your infinitely dedicated and even more competently selected advisors are working hard to further consolidate your power, with counsel on how your flawless government should wield the undeniably correct state-run media.

The Debate
1. "We must ensure that you are forever in people's hearts and minds," says your Minister of Truth, patriotically cutting traitorous ministers out of official photographs with a pair of safety scissors. "You must be referenced in every article of every publication. Also, the front pages of all the newspapers will now be dedicated exclusively to your life's story, like the time you wrote a true crime novel at the age of four. Long live the @@TYPE@@!"

2. "A glorious regime is nothing without its unrivaled military might!" declares Supreme Generalissimo Who Crushes Enemies Winston Perez, who's had your back since the beginning. "Undying trust in our armed forces begets undying trust in you. We must use our media apparatus to tell wonderful yet plausible and completely correct tales of our military triumphs in faraway lands. Long live the @@TYPE@@!"

3. "We should make our populace learn to love you, not fear you, even though no sane person would ever fear you," meekly suggests junior minister Calvin Watterson, cowering behind the Generalissimo.

The Issue
A Bigtopian diplomatic bag was accidentally searched by customs officers, contrary to diplomatic conventions. Before the search was stopped, the bag was found to contain cocaine brownies, snortable marijuana, gold leaf toilet paper rolls, and jars of whale oil. Even though the bags were promptly handed over to the Bigtopian embassy, questions have been raised about this discovery.

The Debate
1. "This is the most obvious case of smuggling I've ever seen!" says customs officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, oblivious to a man wearing a trenchcoat full of fake watches sneaking through the checkpoint behind @@HIM@@. "Those Bigtopians are abusing our trust by bringing in all manner of illegal items, and not paying duties on the legal ones. You need to punish the Bigtopians by expelling them immediately, even if it exposes us as breaking diplomatic conventions."

2. "Why do we allow diplomatic bags anyway?" asks one of your aides. "Just treat embassy luggage the same as any other luggage, subject to the exact same rules and examination as everybody else's bags."

3. "While diplomatic bags aren't meant to contain contraband, the greater fault is ours," observes your Minister of Protocol. "To open a diplomatic bag — even accidentally — is a major breach of trust. Embassies being allowed to confidentially send documents and communications to their own governments is the basis of international diplomacy. Also, dare I say it, our own diplomatic bags carry sensitive information back to us from other nations which are critical to our intelligence community. Apologise to the Bigtopians, claim you didn't look closely at the contents, and offer them a hefty payment in contrition for our impoliteness."

The Issue
Recent studies of becquerel-burdened berries have found that radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing in Althaniq has been carried into @@NAME@@ by transoceanic jet streams.

The Debate
1. "Althaniq might be keen to join the big boys at the nuclear-capable club, but this sort of sloppiness makes it clear they're not ready," comments your Minister of International Patronisation. "@@NAME@@ is like an elder sibling to Althaniq — tell them that they don't need a nuclear weapons program, because they're already under our protection. In fact, tell them they have to cease all testing now and in perpetuity, if they want to stay on our good side, and pay reparations for the harm they've done. They gotta remember their place."

2. "No, can you not see? This is the danger of raw, unadulterated nuclear power!" cries nuclear disarmament activist @@RANDOMFEMALENNAME@@ as she manically waves around a Geiger counter that clicks worryingly as it sweeps past your groin area. "These weapons imperil our very means of life — the ramifications of radiation spare no one. Althaniq must cease their nuclear ambitions, and we should lead by example. Disarm now!"

3. "How boring, like I haven't heard that two hundred and thirty-five times already," yawns nuclear scientist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@. "Look, Althaniq is only doing nuclear tests because they're decades behind advanced nations like ours. We did all our testing decades ago, and there's really no need for them to repeat all that messy business. Just share our technical knowledge with them, and we'll be even closer allies than before."

4. "We should use these jet streams to our advantage," whispers your Minister of Stealth Bombing as he materialises out of nowhere. "Our scientists have compiled a detailed map of jet stream systems — correctly employ these, and we can secretly detonate dirty bombs in the middle of nowhere, while still delivering cancer and illness into the heart of enemy nations."

To your surprise, the Skandilundian council that picks the winners has let you know that this year they intend to award it to you.

"That's a victory for our chaps in the diplomatic corps, pulling strings and working their magic and reframing our military activities as being for global good.

2. "Maybe we should instead be trying to make ourselves worthy of the prize?" suggests your niece, symbolically swatting at the military officer with an olive branch. "Bring overseas troops home, honourably discharge them from service and begin a process of demilitarisation. Like I always say to my mum, there's no need to be so hostile."

3. "Ha, these feeble Skandilunders are terrified of us, and they're trying to placate us by offering us this petty tribute," laughs your Minister of Bovine Disruption of Porcelain Retail. "We should accept the prize, but suggest that rather than a cash prize, perhaps they could cede us a little territory, maybe those halite mines in the northwest.

Every year, the nation comes together to remember those who gave the ultimate sacrifice in defence of @@NAME@@. While the majority of the population partakes in this act of remembrance, a small number of families dread this day — the relatives of those who were executed after being found guilty of desertion. Recently released documents have suggested that many were killed as a result of sham trials.

The Debate
1. "My great-uncle @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@ was no coward," sobs @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME1@@ @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, as she cradles a photo of her relative. "The military records show that he retreated from combat while under attack. However, his letters to his wife explain that he was trying to get to higher ground so that he could pick off the enemy with his sniper rifle. He was accused of abandoning his post and was tried by officers who weren't anywhere near him at the time, all without a lawyer present. All I ask is for a posthumous pardon — for him and any other veterans who were illegitimately convicted — so that at the next remembrance service, I can lay a wreath with pride knowing that he served his country."

2. "That's preposterous!" proclaims General @@RANDOM_NAME2@@, as @@HE2@@ stares at @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME1@@ with suspicion. "Pardoning those deserters would be an insult to those who died honourably on the battlefield. Moreover, everyone was tried fairly by officers who were proficient in the laws of the day. To be quite honest, I feel the army has gone too soft in recent years and stricter punishments for cowardice should be introduced."

3. "Why is it only the deceased being considered for pardons?" probes @@RANDOM_NAME3@@, a specialist in criminal law, as @@HE3@@ grasps the lapels of @@HIS3@@ jacket. "One of my clients in the armed forces was sentenced to hard labor after a very dubious trial. Critical evidence was declared inadmissible, and the eyewitness statements were questionable at best.

"I glimpsed this glorious creature and saw it had antlered horns, like Cernunnos or Naigamesha! Trying to capture the divine would be an insult against Gaia! We should just block off the forest where it lives and create a sanctified nature reserve where profane humanity is forbidden, save for the occasional religious rite or fertility ritual."

*4. "No way man, that'd be a crime against nature!" yells New Age mystic and meditation leader Jefferson Aeroglider.

We should just block off the forest where it lives and create a sanctified nature reserve where profane humanity is forbidden, save for the occasional religious rite or fertility ritual." He waggles his eyebrows suggestively. [Policy TBD]

5. "Kill it, experiment on it, worship it... Come on everyone, are we really this stupid?" asks unemployed TV personality Adam Fierce. "This so-called 'new creature' is obviously a hoax to troll people, or maybe some marketing gimmick to promote an upcoming movie. I mean, the quality of the videos is terrible! One so-called witness claimed that the beast couldn't see him because he was dressed in orange. Does that sound like a real thing to you? What I propose we do is promote critical thinking, with a state-funded TV show centred around myth-busting. Why yes, I am available..."

"Caustic shell chemicals are released by deshelling cashews, causing chronic acid burns to workers' hands, all because Núi Và Sông growers are too stingy to provide protective gloves," lectures @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing an 'Ethical Importing Matters' T-shirt that was probably manufactured in a Dàguó sweatshop. "Worse still, many of these workers are unpaid forced labour from so-called drug rehabilitation centres. Just so you can put your nuts in a bowl on the coffee table! We should demand that these plantations improve their working standards, and ban imports from them till they do so."

2. "Look, if we stopped trading with every nation that has dodgy labour laws or workers with a skin rash or two, we wouldn't be able to trade at all," complains spice-lover @@RANDOM_NAME@@, between mouthfuls of a delicious-smelling nut curry. "Maybe instead of restricting trade you could be supporting cashew growers in this country. We can maintain good agricultural workplace standards, and have government subsidisation allow our farmers to present competitive prices. You'd be nuts to say no to that."

3. "I'm nuts for nuts too!" agrees your brother, grabbing a handful of cashew drupe seeds, peanut legume pods and almond kernels. "Except for hazelnuts and candlenuts, which shouldn't count as nuts at all, in my opinion. I have to say though, this idea of using forced labour on plantations sounds like it'd be quite good for our economy. We should set something like that up."

[b][anchor=1435]#1435[/anchor]: A Hot Potato [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Thanks to generous agricultural subsidies, @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ farmers have produced a record number of potatoes this year, generating a significant surplus.

The Debate
1. "This is the seventh day in a row my old lady cooked potato soup for dinner and I can't take it anymore!" clamours @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a farmer, dejectedly leaning on a yardstick. "We have just tons and tons of potatoes and they will all rot if we cannot sell them. The government needs to buy them from us, otherwise a year's hard work will go to waste. Give them to the hungry, find some other use for them... just take them, please!"

2. "We just need to motivate people to buy and eat more potatoes," explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Creative Solutions, attempting to juggle three potatoes and staggering as one bounces off @@HIS@@ forehead. "How about government-sponsored comics, cartoons and movies where the superheroes derive strength from eating potatoes! The Amazing Potato Woman! The Red Russet! Yukon Booster Gold! What do you think?"

3. "This clearly shows poor planning on the part of your farmers," grunts the People's Ambassador from the Socialist Union of East Lebatuck. "Of course you will have a surplus if everyone decides to plant potatoes! The key is to diversify! If your neighbor Farmer Joe is planting potatoes this year, maybe you should switch to celery instead. That's why you need a centrally planned economy. No surplus, no shortages — just eternal bliss and abundance!"

4. "This potato mountain is tangible proof that commie economics are inefficient," asserts right-wing economist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, presenting you with an invoice for the advice @HE@@ is about to deliver. "Subsidies distort production, and block the invisible hand of self-correcting markets. Stop agricultural subsidies. You'll end up with a leaner industry, and some temporary hardship, but in the long run you'll be supporting the system that creates the wealth of nations."

[b][anchor=1436]#1436[/anchor]: Meat Meet [Fauxia; ed: Frieden-und Freudenland][/b]

The Issue
@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ moralists are outraged, as usual. This time, they're roasting your ambassador to the United Federation, Hermione Evans, who was revealed to have eaten fried chicken at a meeting with their Secretary of State.

The Debate
1. "I'm not going to mince my words," says ethicist Manuel Maldonado, waving celery sticks in your face. "That jerk gamed the system to put the Secretary's meat in her mouth. An ambassador who approves of the slaughter of innocents in the United Federation cannot be tolerated. It's time to trim the fat and give Ambassador Evans the chop."

2. "Can we get to the heart of the tissue - er, issue?" asks Hermione Evans, while grilling Federation Freddie's Definitely Veggie Not Smuggled Real Beef Burgers. "Meat is an important component of the United Federation's culture, and it would be disrespectful to refuse their national dishes. I support the ban on meat eating in @@NAME@@, but on some rare occasions, ambassadors need to accommodate their hosts for a job well done. We should be allowed to do whatever it takes to keep foreign relationships from spoiling."

3. "Sure, that saves the ambassador's bacon," snorts Selma Sisko, porky four-time winner of the @@CAPITAL@@ Vegetarian Hot Dog Eating Contest. "But what about us? If ambassadors are going to get their hands on meat anyway, everyone else should be able to without the law crying 'fowl'. We can flesh out an agreement to keep some unethical practices off the table, but it is time the government stopped dictating what we can eat."

The Issue
Tragically, a homeless @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ man was crushed to death in a garbage truck's compactor after falling asleep in a dumpster.

The Debate
1. "What we need to do is make it impossible for people to go into dumpsters," suggests Health and Safety Inspector @@RANDOM_NAME@@, applying plastic table corner guards to your desk. "Make the hatchways too small to go in, and to be on the safe side, train garbage people to check the inside every time."

2. "That only treats the symptom, not the cause," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Minister of Thinking Outside Boxes, who has spent the night sleeping in a cardboard box to 'get in touch with my inner outcast'. "How about we simply build more homeless shelters? Give these poor people a warm place to spend the night, a good breakfast, and maybe some financial help getting their life back on track, no questions asked."

3. "Look, this was just one guy who realized he was human trash, and committed suicide in a messy way," complains Garbage Union Rep @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is well known for his garbage opinions. "What about the poor municipal workers who are suffering nightmares now from his thoughtlessness? A better solution would be to let trucks play loud music in the cab, to drown out the hobo screams! We need to protect the mental health of our people!"

[b][anchor=1438]#1438[/anchor]: Push Polling [Cretox State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
In the aftermath of a recent close election, your government has received a litany of complaints concerning the activities of 'Bikers for @@LEADER@@', a grassroots organization whose intense mass demonstrations in front of polling locations and alleged harassment of opposition voters may have swung the election in your favor.

The Debate
1. "We're just tryin' ta' help, is all," says head biker @@RANDOM_NAME@@, placing a friendly arm around your shoulder and pinning one of your own party's buttons to your chest. "Maybe we swung the election a bit. Who knows? We're just exercisin' our right ta' express ourselves politically like any folks can do, and you should be supporting that. Otherwise, I can't guarantee ma boys an' I will keep bein' so friendly in the future."

2. "Can't we all just get along?" asks your Director of Managerial Oversight, hanging an empty suit on your coat rack. "How about we set up special cordoned-off areas some distance away from voting locations specifically for these demonstrations? It'll appease the more enthusiastic political types while alleviating any concerns about them interfering in the electoral process."

3. "Such a nasty person. So nasty," rambles TV celebrity Edward Rump, who claims that he is the nation's elected leader, despite all evidence to the contrary. "People say it's nasty, very many people, you're hearing, they're calling it everywhere. And we need to call — they give us a call, and they vote. And the vote won't be nasty, because it's fair, and we're calling it. Bigtopia's building a call center. They're competing with us — the voters call and not the nasty people and it'll be so fair. So fair."

[b][anchor=1439]#1439[/anchor]: Philately Will Get You Nowhere [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Frieden-und Freudenland][/b]

The Issue
The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Post Office reported an unexpected rise in the sale of stamps, which was oddly unaccompanied by any increase in mail deliveries. Further research has revealed that increasing numbers of @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are buying stamps to use in place of cash, with the value of the stamp acting as a promissory note for its monetary value.

The Debate
1. "I'll admit, stamps aren't ideal for this purpose," concedes grocer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who recently started accepting stamps in lieu of payment for her lovely melons. "They're a little fiddly, and if they get damp they stick together. Maybe you lot in government could make some bigger stamps, like something that would fit nicely in a good ol' fashioned wallet, without any adhesive. You could watermark them to prevent forgery, and maybe produce them at a range of values, from 1 to 100 @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. That'd be quite handy for day-to-day business, you know?"

2. "The whole point of digital money was to make transactions fully traceable!" splutters your Minister of Taxpayer Surveillance, thrusting a black market banana in your face somewhat aggressively. "We need to get rid of stamps, and make transactions of that sort occur purely digitally as well: a unique scannable code on mail can work just as well as a stamp. While we're at it we'll need to ban any other physical object that has a direct cash value: casino chips, book tokens, luncheon vouchers... they've all got to go!"

3. "It's not the stamps that are the problem, it's the illegal transactions," growls your police chief, upsetting the grocer's apple cart. "We need to fund sting operations to catch any trader who accepts payment in any form other than electronic credit transfer, and destroy their stock when they fail to comply." He stamps all over the fallen produce to demonstrate. "How do you like them apples?"

4. "There's always a simpler way," suggests grumpy genius Tari Pratshet. "All you need to do is erode the public's confidence in stamps - money only works as such if people accept its value. If you run a campaign of whispers reminding people that banks and credit companies don't accept stamps, and talk about all the things they can only buy with proper electronic credit, then they will become less inclined to treat these things as money. The fad will pass."
