[b][anchor=380]#380[/anchor]: Farmers Seeding Discontent [Bulgar Rouge; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Farmers throughout the country are threatening a nationwide strike, because their domestic produce cannot compete with cheap foreign imports. They demand that the government step in and protect the agricultural sector.

The Debate
1. "Foreign competition is slowly destroying us!" yells @@RANDOMNAME@@ while waving a pitchfork. "We invest so much effort and time to get a quality yield, and eventually we end up throwing everything away because those cheap, plastic Maxtopian tomatoes are sold for half the price! I swear they taste like compost wrapped in iceburg lettuce, and yet @@DENOYNMPLURAL@@ still buy the damned things! We, the farmers of @@NAME@@, demand agricultural subsidies so we can lower our prices and compete fairly with imports. After all, our food security depends upon domestic production."

2. Economic analyst @@RANDOMNAME@@ has other ideas. "There's an easier way to support farmers without spending millions on farms that never went beyond ox plowing. Just raise tariffs. Agriculture will be protected from a transnational race to the bottom, and @@DENOYNMPLURAL@@ get a little tax cut to boot. The tariffs will be unpopular abroad, but this conundrum only exists becaue of Maxtopia's long history of protectionism."

*3. "Are these people serious?" scoffs @@RANDOMNAME@@, owner of A Whole Shipload, LLC. "Subsidies, tariffs, what is all that about? You're messing with the free market here! If foreign produce is cheaper, then that means they're better at doing their jobs. These ungrateful peasants just want government coddling, because they can't pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. It's time that @@NAME@@ promote personal responsibility instead of pandering to the weak. Crush the strike by abolishing all foodstuff tariffs, and then we can import as much as we like."

The Issue
The media is up in arms over the case of Eddie Jupiter, a minor who is being tried as an adult on suspicion of murder; the case has sparked a national debate over @NAME@@ and youth crime.

The Debate
1. "He's just a poor boy from a poor family!" pleads @@RANDOMNAME@@, youth welfare activist and rock fan appearing on @@NAME@@'s most popular morning show. "Spare him his life from this monstrosity! The government must not try teens as adults. In fact, you really can't try them at all; they clearly don't understand the magnitude of their actions. Maybe if our government gave schools more funding, the teachers could explain this 'don't murder' concept a little better."

2. "Don't understand?!" thunders prosecuting attorney @@RANDOMNAME@@ during one of many press conferences. "Tell that to the victim! The punk put a gun against his head and pulled the trigger. Now he's dead! The youth of @@NAME@@ need to learn to respect the rules of decent society, and the best way to do that is to impose harsher penalties. Solitary confinement, public punishment, curfews - the whole works. As for this kid, lock him up!"

3. "I couldn't agree more," muses a major religion representative @@RANDOMNAME@@ while proselytizing to your staff. "Except the civil authorities shouldn't be the ones dealing with Jupiter. Beelzebub has a devil put aside for him, and only true penitence can save his soul. In fact, better give the true faith power to punish, er, save all criminals! I find there's no better cure for a sick soul than public whipping, don't you agree?"

[b][anchor=382]#382[/anchor]: The Appropriate Amount of Appropriation [Rapturia Ziwa; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
Recently a well-known clothing retailer, "Totally Happenin' Apparel Trends" (T.H.A.T.), began marketing a new hoodie that features deeply sacred iconography of a @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ ethnic group. Civil rights activists, tribal emissaries, entrepreneurs, and an assortment of young punks from the local skate park have formed an impressive mob outside your office, demanding you take action.

The Debate
1. "Oh come on, you can't be serious," scoffs CEO of T.H.A.T. @@RANDOMNAME@@, bedecked in a war bonnet and calavera-patterned t-shirt. "It's not 'stealing,' it's assimilating. Next you're going to be telling me certain ethnic foods and languages are being appropriated, too! These people just don't realize that we're helping promote parts of their cultural heritage by mainstreaming it. Think about how many people didn't know about the Native @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Emblem until we featured it on our clothes. Frankly, they should be thanking us."

2. "This is racist stereotyping and an insult to our proud culture!" shouts @@RANDOMNAME@@, a representative of the United @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Nations. "@@NAME@@ has been responsible for centuries' worth of genocide, rape, and discrimination against our people, and now you have the audacity to take one of our most sacred icons and turn it into a fashion statement? This isn't cultural exchange; it's cultural theft. We owe you no obligation and shouldn't have to share something you willingly bastardize. Cultural symbols, like ours, should only be worn by people that can prove they descend from that ethnicity."

3. "Woah, now, let's not get hasty. This is just a misunderstanding," cautions anthropologist @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Clearly T.H.A.T. had no right to misrepresent that @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ symbol like they did. But making these heritages off-limits to all outsiders? That's a little extreme, too. Why not introduce educational programs that aim to teach people about their culture, so ignorant folk don't accidentally make that mistake. We'll need a little government funding to kick-start the programs, but surely cultural acceptance and equality are worth the @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@?"

4. "Yo, man, did'ja consider the possibility you're askin' the wrong questions?" says a local youth, shouldering his way to the front of the crowd. "My parents are, like, a bunch of ethnicities all blended together, so we never have to worry about someone cribbin' our style, or who we should or shouldn't identify with. Why not make all forms of cultural identification a thing of the past? That way we don't have to worry about appeasin' or insultin' any one social group. It's mostly our parents and grandparents doin' all the yakkin', anyway."

The Issue
A much-publicised incident last week saw a pack of feral youngsters raised by @@ANIMALPLURAL@@ attack a rambler exploring @@NAME@@'s countryside. Shocked by the news stories, human rights campaigners have demanded immediate remedial action to rebuild @@NAME@@'s social structure.

The Debate
1. "We can't just sit here while innocent children are denied their birthright to be human!" pleads human rights activist @@RANDOMNAME@@. "We need to implement a truckload of changes. That means increasing welfare spending, implementing strict punishments for child abuse and neglect, and most importantly, we need to send a task force to rescue these poor victims! Incidentally, we'd need to increase taxes to get these things done, but for Violet's sake, think of the children!"

2. "These children won't be able to just walk back into society," snaps Commandant @@RANDOMNAME@@. "They're already a world apart from normal people. However, we can take advantage of that. If you let us take these children under our wing, in just a few years, they'll be the pride of @@NAME@@'s military! It'll be much better than that plan to mount guns on our K-9 units."

3. "You can't take these kids away from their families!" says famous environmental activist, writer, and hermit @@RANDOMNAME@@. "My neighbors, Akela and Raksha have raised little Maxgli for ten years, and they'd be devastated if they were forcibly separated by these overbearing, intolerant ethnocentrists! This couple needs to have their rights respected, too! Now if one bad @@ANIMAL@@ does something a little harsh, like eating its child, then just discipline it like any normal parent!"

4. "OH MY GOD, IT IS SO CUTE!" squeals @@RANDOMNAME@@, the next-in-line to inherit multinational beekeeping conglomerate Buzz Feed Inc. "It's like a little @@ANIMAL@@ but it's a person! I wanna keep it, I'm gonna call it FooFoo, and carry it around in my handbag, and... what do you mean it's against the law?! Make it un-against the law! I want my FooFoo!"

[b][anchor=384]#384[/anchor]: Out of The Royal Frying Pan [The Kingdom of the Imperial Commonwealth; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
The international community rejoiced this year as the people of Marche Noire overthrew the country's oppressive monarchy... only to elect an aggressively anti-@@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ leader.

The Debate
1. "We have to do something drastic," schemes General @@RANDOMNAME@@ whilst lining up a row of dominoes, "Marche Noire is angry that we trained the old regime's secret police, and now they're letting the peasants divvy up the plantations. That threatens our business interests, and it could even inspire revolutions in some of our allies. I say we covertly support Marche Noirian rebels to reinstate King Zog. The alternative is an ever-growing bloc of socialist powers, which will doom us in the long run." The general topples the first domino, beginning a chain reaction.

*2. "Now, let's not get carried away," counsels Foreign Minister @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@ with her pet kitten in lap. "There's more than one way to skin a cat, you know. For instance, we could simply put an embargo or ten on Marche Noire until it elects a cooperative prime minister. Half the country drives Marche Noirian cars; a trade sanction would cripple them. That way we can show our opposition to communist jingoism without sacrificing @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ lives." [[color=blue]Cars are not banned[/color]]

4. "No way, man!" rebuts @@RANDOMNAME@@, world-renowned professional skateboarder and incorrigible optimist. "Military intervention and trade sanctions are just going to make Marche Noire, like, more mad at us! Those kids in Marche Noire love me. If you send me and some of my fellow skaters over there, I'm sure we can work this whole thing out with, like, diplomacy and stuff."

The Issue
After the unfortunate and untimely death of @@NAME@@'s premier sporting mascot just before a major national Calvinball competition, the decision regarding his replacement has been pushed higher and higher up the chain of command until now, having somehow reached your desk.

The Debate
1. "@@NAME@@ should show that it c-cares for everyone," stammers once-world class juggler, @@RANDOMNAME@@, now a nervous paraplegic, "Even the v-very weakest in our so-so-soci-country. Our compassion comes across in our welfare, our healthcare, our v-very w-way of life. That's why I sh-should be the one to represent it. After all, if I can do it, so can anyone!"

2. "No," growls a mysterious figure, audibly recovering from a tracheotomy, bedecked in a cape and cowl, "We need to prize the values that keep us safe, in government and outside it. The ones that keep citizens from a life of crime. Order. Justice. Parents. I will represent that. I am the hero @@NAME@@ deserves."

[3]. "But not the one it needs!" exclaims the chief executive of BurgerCorp, @@RANDOMNAME@@, striding into your office dressed as his latest product, "What @@NAME@@ needs right now is to plug the looming hole in its budget - and that's something we can do through corporate sponsorship!

The Issue
A @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ drone strike in the hinterlands of Tasmania has successfully killed an infamous terrorist, Mad Max, notorious for assassinating your predecessor. However, collateral damage butchered dozens of innocent bystanders, outraging the international community.

The Debate
1. "These pinkos just love to make the worst out of positive situations," moans Lieutenant @@RANDOMNAME@@, who oversaw the drone strike from the comforts of @@CAPITAL@@. "Sure, some civilians were injured, but we managed to kill that psychopathic criminal. Had he survived, who knows how many more innocents he would have killed? Drone strikes are not only far more efficient than land invasions, but they also save the lives of @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ pilots. If anything, the military deserves a much bigger budget to research new innovations like semi-autonomous stealthbots."

2. "Does anyone care what we have to say?" asks the Tasmanian ambassador, @@RANDOMNAME@@, rallying in front of assorted pacifists. "You have no business intervening in our lands; let Tasmania control what happens in her borders! Imagine how you would like it if we started drone striking your streets. It's time for @@NAME@@ to back off and let nations settle their own problems. If @@NAME@@ wants to help, reparations for the grieving families would be a lot more appreciated than more robot assassins patrolling the skies."

[b][anchor=387]#387[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Diamonds Are An Expat's Best Friend! [Reploid Productions; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
Media outlets have been buzzing about the thousands of children abducted from their remote villages across the exotic nation of Brasilistan, suspected to have been carried out on the order of their own government. Reports are coming in that the abducted children have been sent underground to mine for diamonds, Brasilistan's most precious resource, but military intelligence suggests that some young @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ citizens living there have fallen to the same fate.

The Debate
1. "The Brasilistani government have been pursuing aggressive and provoking policies for years, especially in their attempts to annex their neighbour Marche Noire. Now they're abducting and holding hostage not only their own children, but citizens of other countries!" booms General @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, slamming her fist on the conference table and urgently gesturing to a map on the wall. "We have sat idly by and now it's our people over there waking up in the middle of the night to bombs and soldiers destroying their homes! @@LEADER@@, we must marshal our forces and intervene with the only language the Brasilistani seem to understand - violence!"

2. "The good general is surely exaggerating the threat here." @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, one of your trusted advisers responds calmly while drinking his tea. "Brasilistan is our foremost diamond trade partner, so we must approach the situation with diplomacy and targeted efforts. A knee-jerk military response is the worst thing we could possibly do here. I am confident that with some juicy incentives, the Brasilistani government will discover their error and immediately release our citizens."

[b][anchor=388]#388[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Napalm in the Morning [Reploid Productions; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
A troubled country called Brasilistan has abducted @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ tourists and sent them to work in diamond mines in appalling conditions. You gathered your advisers and decided the best course of action was war; immediate and violent.

The Issue
This is a grim day in the history of @@NAME@@. Today, @@NAME@@ goes to war. All eyes are on officials in @@CAPITAL@@, waiting with bated breath to learn what form the coming conflict with Brasilistan will take.

The Debate
1. "We must mount a full-scale invasion," declares General @@RANDOMNAME@@ while jabbing at a map of Brasilistan. "We can land forces here, here, and here; and from there we can march straight on to their capital! It could cost millions of our soldiers' lives and take years, but short of nuking Brasilistan, this is the only road to victory."

2."With all due respect, General, you are completely out of your mind!" @@RANDOMNAME@@ of the Air Force huffs. "A full on attack will decimate our troop levels! This is a land whose terrain and climate our foot soldiers are unaccustomed to. No, the best approach is clearly the tactical one. We have gathered a list of targets that can be taken out through a sustained aerial campaign. This will reduce Brasilistan's ability to wage war long before we land a single troop carrier in their territory. Why send scores of our soldiers to their deaths when we can send scores of our bombs instead?"

[b][anchor=389]#389[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Sanctions, Sanctions Everywhere! [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
A distant country called Brasilistan has abducted @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ citizens and sent them to work in diamond mines in appalling conditions. You gathered your advisers and decided the best course of action was to wade in carefully with some carrot-and-stick diplomacy.

The Issue
The decision to try for a diplomatic solution with Brasilistan, rather than open warfare, has been a success with the hostages released. However, aggrieved leading members of the Brasilistani government are openly encouraging vigilantes in the nation's armed forces to hit back at @@NAME@@ and its interests. The debate now turns to what @@NAME@@ should do next to completely neutralise Brasilistan.

The Debate
1. "Extending the hand of peace was all well and good, but now we have to make sure they stay under our thumb", your Minister for Foreign Affairs Hillary Smoochinger says candidly, taking a seat in your office. "Right now they can fall back on their military and continue to do unspeakable and violent acts - don't forget they abducted their own children! But if we make that option unviable, then I think we'll find them more than eager to sit down to peace talks. To cripple their military, we need to cripple their economy, and the most effective way to do this is through sanctions. We can embargo the non-essential items, and stick considerable tariffs on the stuff we do need. Eventually they'll have to accede to our demands."

2. "Crippling their military is a good idea, but we don't have the time for economics to work", the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, General Dwight Powell barks. "We need to get our Navy to blockade their ports, get our Air Force to bomb their airfields and key economic centres – we don't have to put a single soldier on Brasilistan soil and we'll still be able to force them into submission. With blockaded ports, burning airfields, and a decimated economy, their military will have no hope of controlling the home front, let alone invading another country. They'll be soon doing what we tell them. A little gunboat diplomacy is all we need."

3. "These options all sound quite expensive", chimes in Timothy Lagarde, the Treasury Minister. "Wouldn't it be cheaper to, perhaps, send in a few very well trained, and very deadly, operatives and have them deal with the top officials in the regime? We might find some to be very agreeable to our terms after a few intense ... 'workouts', we'll call them. If they refuse to be co-operative, well, I'm sure removing them from the situation entirely might convince their successors to see our way of thinking. It'll be cheaper for us with no long lasting effects on either nation. Everybody wins! Except for those assassinated, of course, but let's not concern ourselves with those little details."

The Story So Far
Your government's response to overtures of aggression from the Brasilistanis has been to march the @@DENOMYMNOUN@@ army in and take out the tyrannical and violent government.

The Issue
The "intervention" into Brasilistan has largely been a success, but now the nation has devolved into anarchy with no functioning government. International allies and observers are concerned and have asked that @@NAME@@ clean up the mess it made.

The Debate
1. "This is our chance to expand our power and influence", your Minister for Defence suggests quietly. "Brasilistan might have had a tyrannical government, but the people may be useful, and it does have plenty of resources. We need to send in the remainder of our armed forces, quell any dissent, and set ourselves up a nice colony. We'd have more taxes coming in, a larger pool of people for our army to recruit from, and we'll have a nice power base in a far off part of the region. It'll be costly, but definitely worth it."

*2. Foreign Minister Hillary Smoochinger sighs before joining in the conversation. "If we colonise Brasilistan then we'll be doing exactly what its last government did that got us into this mess – sweeping attacks on another people's sovereignty. I agree that we should send in more troops to clean up things, but then we should help them set up a new, stable, and less aggressive government. Admittedly, this will consume large resources in the short term, but think of the public support we'd attain by establishing a new democracy full of freedoms abroad. And the long term benefits of ensuring it's a government that's friendly and sympathetic to our aims are pretty enticing too." [[color=blue]Must be democratic[/color]]

The Story So Far
Your government's response to overtures of aggression from the Brasilistanis has been to sanction it beyond imagination.

The Issue
International allies have formed a coalition to impose economic sanctions on Brasilistan, but as a consequence, the nation can no longer import enough basic supplies to sustain its population. As it becomes increasingly impoverished, the embargoed civilian population is dying of hunger.

The Debate
1. "We can't stand by and let innocent men, women, and children die of malnourishment because of your government's shortsighted actions!" cries the CEO of the Global Meal Plan, @@RANDOMNAME@@. "I know you're trying to make Brasilistan back off through economic means, but you need to please lay off some of the sanctions and embargoes and send some food aid through. You want to avoid the casualties of a war, but innocent people are still dying. I beg you, fix this."

2. "Brasilistan is weak, its people are dying, now's the time to deal the killer blow", your Minister for the Interior argues. "Of course we should send them food aid, but only if the Brasilistan government agrees to end their aggression, surrender to us, and submit their nation to our control. This little diplomatic incident will have ended, the Brasilistani will have food again, and our government can get back to spending money where it's necessary. Everybody wins."

[b][anchor=392]#392[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: A Pirate Problem [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Your government's response to overtures of aggression from the Brasilistanis has been to blockade its ports and bomb its economic hubs.

The Issue
@@NAME@@'s policy of forcing Brasilistan into submission via means of gunboat diplomacy has left the nation's government - and economy - in a shambles. However, rogue elements of Brasilistani society have taken to the high seas and are committing acts of piracy in order to make ends meet. With no functioning government to stop them, these pirates are being left to their own devices, putting @@NAME@@'s shipping routes at risk.

The Debate
1. "Obviously we have to get rid of these ruffians", your Trade Minister says bluntly. "They're putting our own economy at risk, as well as those of our allies. We've put a lot of time, energy, and resources into ensuring Brasilistan no longer remains a threat to us, and if we don't deal with these pirates soon, we might as well rename the place Penzance. Look, we already have naval ships in the area, why not just divert a few to take care of the problem. That way our economy is saved and we don't put the lives of any more soldiers at risk."

2. "That sounds a little drastic for what is basically a bunch of Brasilistani entrepreneurs", an advisor interjects dryly from the other side of the room. "We should be rewarding them for succeeding when their nation's economy is shot. Brasilistan needs a new, functional, stable government, and here are a bunch of people who have proven their ability to fight through the bad times. With our support, we could put these patriots in charge of their country and, obviously as thanks, we'll have a much more amiable Brasilistan to work with in the international sphere. They can get on dealing with their problems, and we can get on looking after our own people. Everything will be back as it should be."

[b][anchor=393]#393[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: A Naval Conundrum [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
@@NAME@@'s economic sanctions of Brasilistan have resulted in exploding levels of piracy. Your government has advised you on how to deal with this fledgling problem, and your response has been to send the navy after them.

The Issue
As the might of @@NAME@@'s armed forces heads for the seas off Brasilistan to deal with the pirates attacking shipping routes, the question of what to actually do with them has arisen.

The Debate
1. "The proper course of action would be to capture them and escort them back to Brasilistan to stand trial", your foreign adviser suggests. "There isn't much of a governmental structure there at the moment, I admit, but perhaps if we press upon what remains of the authorities the gravity of the situation, they'll act. If that means throwing them some resources to hold the trial, so be it. It's better we have nothing to do with the filthy pirates anyway."

2. "Why bother going through all that when we can do it better", boasts your Attorney General. "I agree that we should capture the hooligans, but then we should drag them back here to @@NAME@@ to stand trial. Who cares if they're not our citizens; they interfered in our shipping routes and posed a threat to our economy! That's sort of like terrorism, right? Economic terrorism! We've dealt with Brasilistan, now lets deal with these pirates and use them as an example of what we do to groups who try to harm our interests."

3. "Capture them?! That'll take far too much time! I know of an easier way to sort this lot out once and for all", Admiral @@RANDOMNAME@@ states with a sharp nod of his head. "We've sent planes and ships and whatnot out there already, let's just blow them out of the water while we're there. It'll save us having to drag them half way across the waters of @@REGION@@ for what'll essentially be a show trial anyway. Yeah, the human rights pansies will complain but who cares. This is economic terrorism and we must show no mercy to terrorists!"

Her report details abuse, incompetence and negligence, and has led to angry clamors for reform of how the system is managed.

The Debate
1. "These hospitals are being run like prisons!" belts irate social worker @@RANDOMMALENAME@@ as he slams down a copy of the article on your desk. "Patients are treated like inmates; their rooms are like cells, and these antiquated 'treatments' redefine barbaric! Something must be done!" He pauses for a moment to regain his composure.

"At this rate we're already going to be running a deficit next year anyway. We should be cutting down on expenses, not spending more.

In order to secure @@NAME@@'s interest in Brasilistan, as well as stabilise the ravaged country, your government has ensured that someone agreeable to @@NAME@@ has been installed as leader.

The Issue
After @@NAME@@'s hand-picked candidate for leader of Brasilistan was assassinated in broad daylight – and then the next hand-picked successor mysteriously disappearing overnight – it's becoming clear that propping up a new government that is friendly to @@NAMES@@'s aims is much more difficult that originally imagined.

The Debate
1."It's time we left Brasilistan, and that whole region, well alone", Hillary Smoochinger, your Foreign Minister says quietly, putting a hand on your shoulder. "It's clear that the natives are resisting our blatant interference, and our own popularity here at home may begin to suffer if we keep pouring @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ into another country. Let's just pull out and start spending that money where it belongs, here in @@NAME@@."

2."I agree – to an extent", your Treasury Minister Timothy Legarde says, chiming in. "We definitely need to get out of the area as soon as possible, but that doesn't mean we should abandon all interests there. We need to pick a faction we like, show them how generous we can be in selling them some armaments and, ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom, we're not only seeing our interests served in the area, we're making cash while doing it. Extra bonus is we're not risking any of our people's lives. It can't go wrong!"

3."What absolute bullsh-, eh pat. Absolute bullpat", General Dwight Powell, your Armed Forces Chief of Staff blurts out before correcting himself. "Yes, this puppetmaster routine clearly isn't working, but that doesn't mean we need to cut our losses and get out of the area! No, clearly we have something to gain from this and that something is Brasilistan itself. It's time to take the place over and sort the mess out ourselves in our own time-honoured way – absolute brute force."

[b][anchor=396]#396[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Is It Brie You're Looking For? [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
The World Assembly's International Food Welfare Organization has estimated that @@NAME@@'s harsh economic sanctions has led to the deaths of at least 50,000 starving Brasilitani. After pleas from civil rights societies and humanitarian organisations, your government has agreed to allow some aid into Brasilistan.

The Issue
Humanitarian NGOs are distraught after extensive news reports highlighting that food aid shipments meant for the poor, starving, and destitute in Brasilistan are not making it past the distribution centres. Reports are unsure whether or not corrupt officials are to blame, but the NGOs want you to do something about it.

The Debate
1. @@RANDOMNAME@@, a director of one of @@NAME@@'s largest charities, sighs. "It's not like this wasn't forseen. We all knew that the government elites in control of the Brasilistani distribution centres would look after themselves. This is what happens when you send unconditional aid unprotected like this. We have to continue the shipments, but from now on we need to send our peacekeepers to make sure the food gets to where it's needed."

2. "Or we could actually stop the shipments", your secretary says while collating some pages on your desk. "Look, there's always going to be corruption when we're sending them free food, so how about we spend the money on education programmes instead. You know, show the starving how to farm and hunt and make a living all for themselves. It's like that saying, give a man a fishing rod and he does, em, well he fishes with it, and he doesn't starve, that's the point. We can't forever prop them up with our food."

3. "I agree, stop the shipments", your advisor @@RANDOMMALENAME@@ says while playing with his hair absent-mindedly. "Stop the shipments and let the Brasilistani fend for themselves. If they starve, they starve – let's not forget who started this whole thing in the first place! If they want to act as savages, then let them live by the law of the savages; survival of the fittest should sort them out once and for all. And no more food aid means more resources for use at home. Win."

The Story So Far
Your government's response to overtures of aggression from the Brasilistanis has been to bomb specific high-level, valuable assets in the nation.

The Issue
Having decided to launch a tactical strike on Brasilistan, your military advisors have drawn up a list of different targets, each ranging in terms of severity and civilian casualties.

The Debate
1. Admiral Nelson Wellington presents you with a file first. "This is an aerial view map of Western Brasilistan. We have circled in red key armament factories, military bases, and a military airport. Eliminating these targets will not only harm the enemy's ability to mobilise an effective retaliatory attack, but it also makes it easier for us to land troops on the west coast. The impact on civilians will be minimal."

2. "That won't be enough", Air Marshal @@RANDOMNAME@@ says firmly. "Here is a map of the same region, but as you can see our targets are much more crucial to Brasilistan's infrastructure. Give the go ahead and my pilots will unleash their bombs on the city itself. There is a 100% chance of high civilian casualties, but it's to ensure that the enemy has a 0% chance of retaliation, in any way, shape, or form."

3. "Or we could just nuke them", General @@RANDOMNAME@@ says, pushing the other two out of the way. "Think about it. None of our soldiers will go in so there'll be zero casualties on our side. All it takes is one bomb, so it's considerably cheaper, and it means there'll be no drawn-out conflict. I can't see a loss. To us, anyway. It'll decimate Brasilistan, but they are the enemy, and this is war."

[b][anchor=398]#398[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Why Did You Do That?! [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Your government's response to Brasilistan holding some @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ citizens hostage was to bomb the living daylights out of cities with heavy population densities.

The Issue
@@NAME@@'s recent indiscriminate bombing of a population centre in western Brasilistan has not only attracted accusations of genocide from the international community, but also promises of sending military aid to Brasilistan to defend themselves from you!

The Debate
1. "We tried that idiot Air Marshal's way and now look where it got us", Admiral Nelson Wellington says with an exasperated sigh. "Now can you please take another look at this plan? It sees our navy launch missiles at a military airfield, key bases, and a couple of armament factories. It'll take place at night which limits civilian casualties to a minimum, and it achieves our aim of reducing Brasilistan's ability to retaliate."

2. "Call their bluff", a random general says, stepping out of the group of military advisers huddled before your desk. "Call those other nations out. Threaten to bomb them too if they even dream about getting involved. This is between us and Brasilistan and we'll be darned if any other pansy state tries to get involved. Keep up the current targeting of civilian centres – it's obviously hitting them where it hurts."

3. "Or... we could nuke them", your Minister for War says quietly. "Nuke them all. Brasilistan and any friends of theirs who join in. Wars are costly, and we already have more than a dozen bombs stockpiled. It won't cost us lives or money and it'll end this conflict quickly. It's time to show the world we mean business and we take war seriously."

[b][anchor=399]#399[/anchor]: [color=green][i]An International Incident[/i][/color]: Invasion Plan [Sanctaria; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Story So Far
Your government's response to Brasilistan holding @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ citizens hostage was to take out military installations and armament factories, weakening the country's military capacity.

The Issue
Despite having had a considerable amount of cruise missiles launched at their military bases and airfields, the Brasilistanis are showing no signs of giving up the fight. Public opinion has turned to ending the conflict, and there is a growing consensus that invasion is the only way to finish it.

The Debate

1. "We've softened them up, but that doesn't mean that an invasion will be easy for us", you military adviser says, unfurling a large map of Brasilistan and laying it out on your desk. "If we land here, here, and here, at these beaches on the west coast, we can march to the capital and wipe out any resistance we come across. We'll need to do it in overwhelming numbers if it's to be any way effective though – it's likely we'll lose a significant number of personnel."

2. "We'll be unnecessarily putting thousands of lives at risk if we do that", your Chief of Staff chimes in. "What we need to do is take out the boys at the top. Chop the head off the snake, as it were. If we cripple the chain of command by a decisive strike to the heart of Brasilistan, I think we'll find the invasion will go much more smoothly. We should be able to airlift our best commandos into the capital without too much difficulty. I trust them to complete the mission. Do you?"

3. "Invasion will cost our soldiers their lives, and we shouldn't put a single citizen's life at risk", your Minister for Domestic Affairs muses loudly. "Brasilistan is proving tougher than expected, their resistance is admirable, but it's time to put this whole thing to rest I think. I suggest we go nuclear. Couple of bombs in a couple of hours and this whole thing will be done by tea-time."
