[b][anchor=1421]#1421[/anchor]: Have Your Cake and Don’t Eat It [Wischland, ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Avery Phillips, a young dancer, recently collapsed with the complications of what was revealed to be anorexia nervosa while dancing in the small, televised role of ‘Girl Waiting for Pater Maxxmas’. National attention has now been drawn to the growing prevalence of eating disorders and related hospitalizations in @@NAME@@, especially among the dance community.

The Debate
1. “Here’s some food for thought,” says psychologist Des Carter, handing you a copy of his new book Cogeato Ergo Sum: I Eat, Therefore I Am. “Eating disorders are growing year on year, in both male and female @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@. They may be the result of low self-esteem, body dysmorphia, or can be comorbid with other psychological disorders. Due to the high morbidity, it is vital that you subsidize psychiatric in-patient treatment and prevent future eating disorders by encouraging citizens to attend government funded therapy. Now, why don’t you lie down on this couch and tell me how you feel...”

2. “Wake up and smell the coffee!” cries Honey @@RANDOMNAME@@, mother of the collapsed teenager. “The true cause of these eating disorders is all the pressure in today’s hypercompetitive, ultra-connected world. Every member of the @@CAPITAL@@ Ballet corps de ballet has a teeny-tiny waist and skinny legs, and it’s ridiculous! My poor child felt she’d never be pretty unless she was severely underweight. Sponsor media promotions of more healthy body proportions, and ban anyone who’s simply too thin from working in sport, dance, or any role where they can be seen by vulnerable youngsters!”

3. “Please, dar-link, this ‘healthy figure’ is so last season,” scoffs cadaverous fashion magazine editor Karla Field, covering the downy hair on her emaciated arms with her plum suit’s sleeves. “Only flabby mummies who stuff their faces with fatty snack-foods object to skinny women, because they feel inferior knowing their own beautiful bones were swallowed by layers of flesh. That’s not our problem. Women who eschew the ravages of food should be praised, not labelled mentally ill. My magazine will even fund a contest to crown Miss Mosquito — the thinnest, most dietetically controlled woman in @@NAME@@ — and provide you with something to replace that monstrosity you’re currently wearing. How about it?”

4. “The obvious solution to eating disorders is to ensure every @@DEMONYM@@ gets the right calories and nutrients,” interjects your Minister of Health, Lettuce @@RANDOMNAME@@. “And how? With a simple law requiring that every citizen eats healthily and to the exact amount required, enforced by monitoring eyes in kitchens, regulated mealtimes, government distributed shopping lists and recipes and ‘clean plate monitors’ to help everybody finish their din-dins... even if they don’t want to. As the icing on the cake, this would also allow us to prevent people from becoming overweight. Of course, it’ll require a lot of oversight, and control of the national food supply, but my department can handle it.”

[b][anchor=1422]#1422[/anchor]: Who Comes Up With This Ship? [Sedgistan; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
It’s a terrible day. Woken early from dreams of joyfully frolicking @@NATIONALANIMALPLURAL@@, you are dragged to the naming ceremony of the latest @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Navy ship. Lashed by more rain than an Albionian could cope with, the sky is the same steely grey as the oversized hulk of metal everyone is making a fuss about, and thanks to the woolen kilt your advisors insisted was “traditional”, the wind is whistling right where you don’t want it to. You thought it couldn’t get any worse, but just as you grasp the ceremonial bottle of bubbly and utter the words, “I hereby name this ship...” you realise you have no idea what the damned thing is to be called.

The Debate
1. One glance at @@RANDOMNAME_1@@, your Minister for Creative Solutions, tells you @@HE_1@@ won’t be any help today. For once bereft of ideas, @@HE_1@@’s studiously avoiding your gaze by pretending to examine a spot off on the distant horizon. What would get 
@@HIS_1@@ goat? Ah, of course — a cold, efficient and utterly unimaginative name.

2. To @@HIS_1@@ right is the perpetually nervous Religious Affairs Minister, @@RANDOMFEMALENAME_2@@, fiddling with @@HIS_2@@ prayer beads as @@HE_2@@ considers @@HIS_2@@ many religious affairs. You can just imagine @@HIS_2@@ reedy, patronising voice telling you to name the ship after a devout godly figure. Of course, there’s some @@HE_2@@’d prefer to forget — who was that patron saint of altar boys?

3. Resolutely staring past your left shoulder is the ever-pompous Rear Admiral @@RANDOMMALENAME_3@@. What would wipe the smirk off @@HIS_3@@ meaty jowls? Perhaps a dashing, daring name of old, like “Warspite” or “Thundercracker”. But with a twist...

4. And of course there’s your office intern @@RANDOMFEMALENAME_4@@, looking smugly right back at you. Of course @@HE_4@@ knows just what the ship should be called, but all @@HE_4@@’s mouthing at you is “Shippy McShipface” — or at least you hope that’s what it is. Oh, to hell with it. Who says you can’t name a ship after yourself?

[b][anchor=1423]#1423[/anchor]: A Slice of the Pi [Candlewhisper Archive; Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Recently, a tech firm from the United Federation used a network of computers and the latest algorithms to calculate pi to an incredible number of decimal places, smashing the previous world record by several orders of magnitude.

The Debate
1. “We can break that United Federation record right here in @@NATION@@, I know it!” exclaims excitable mathematician @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, dancing around you with a manic look on @@HIS@@ face. “All we need is a great big network of super-computers, with customised software, and a year or two of dedicated runtime. I’ve got some ideas for exciting new formulae that will make Chudnovsky look like a chump. I mean, what could be cooler than mathematics and computer programming?”

2. “Look, the pursuit of a list of numbers is just academic frippery and posturing,” moans knitwear-clad structural engineer @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@. “Even physicists don’t bother using values of pi to more than 160 decimal places, so there’s no practical purpose here. Government research and academic subsidies should be focused purely on subjects which have real-world applications and a sound case for projected economic or societal benefit. You know, like my underfunded research on drainage applications of composite 3D-printed concrete micro-structures with resin polymer interior scaffolding. It’s really fascinating stuff. Here, I wrote a paper on it...”

3. “Nerd alert!” yells former high school quarterback turned fry chef @@RANDOMNAME@@, shoulder barging between the two previous speakers, and knocking them to the ground. “Yeah! Feel that impact! Freight train comin’ through! Y’know, the best thing to do here is not to spend money on all this geek stuff at all. School of hard knocks, that’s the lesson plan these weaklings need!” @@HE@@ demonstrates with @@HIS@@ fists.

4. “Honestly, I’ve never liked pi. It’s just so... irrational,” says Minister of Mathematical Certainty Eddie Goodwin. “Can’t we just legislate so that everybody in @@NATION@@ uses a @@DENOUNYMADJECTIVE@@ definition of pi? Let’s just say pi is 3.2. I mean, that’s true anyway for a given curvature of space time. Just say 3.2, and leave it at that, eh?”

[b][anchor=1424]#1424[/anchor]: Here’s Looking at Zoo, Kid [Socio Polor, ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
Following the abolition of zoos, an ecological report has found that a large proportion of released zoo animals have not survived in the wild because they spent most of their lives in captivity.

The Debate
1. “I totally saw this coming,” asserts a pair of talking giraffe’s legs, who you realise is actually the former director of the @@CAPITAL@@ Zoo wearing a giraffe costume on stilts. “It’s a sad scene, isn’t it? Those poor giraffes alone in the wilderness with no way of defending themselves from predators like those supercilious tigers. The public are understandably mad that these exotic animals have no chance of surviving in the wild. The answer is simple: let us recapture all of our animals to save them from themselves and we’ll re-exhibit them once more.”

2. “If you knew this would happen, then why didn’t you prepare the animals before their release?” questions the notoriously catty Secretary of Wildlife Conservation, Beryl Caskin. “Training and rehabilitation are what we need here. We’ll get our people into the wild to hone these animals’ survival instincts by demonstrating to them the behaviours that they will need to survive. For example, we could teach tigers how to stalk their prey or giraffes to whack would-be predators with their necks. A film crew can even follow us around, which will raise public awareness on wildlife conservation without the need for zoos.”

3. “Any human intervention is too much human intervention,” says Konrad Scheer, the head of the Special Protection of Animals Movement. “Besides, the government should be focusing on highly endangered animals such as the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ horny toad. Can you believe there’s only twenty of them left? We can’t risk their extinction. It would be nice if we instead left endangered animal species alone in their own protected reserves, away from other animals, with a never-ending supply of food.”

[b][anchor=1425]#1425[/anchor]: @@LEADER@@’s New Clothes [The United Lands of Ash; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
In the midst of another busy day, you trip on a misplaced paperweight and tear your favorite pants on a nail haphazardly jutting out of your office’s door frame.

The Debate
1. “Oh, this just won’t do!” tuts your aunt, an aspiring seamstress, holding two giant off-color swatches against your torn pants leg. “I’ll get this fixed right up, dearie! A few patches here and stitches there and they’ll be as good as new! Sad that so few people make-do-and-mend these days. Now, pass me your little pants.”

2. Salvatore Matei, representative of the ancient tailors The Leader’s Men, strolls into your office. “It is time for you get new clothes anyway. Let us ditch these old rags and get you something more stylish. I see a classic yet breathable fabric that is sweat and bullet resistant, tailored to flatter your form and worn with ascots — not brogues.”

3. Two brightly dressed men stumble into your office, with tailoring tape around their necks. “We’ve got just the thing for you, your mightiness! The greatest clothes in history, made just for your glorious self.” The first man flicks open a suitcase, revealing... nothing. “As you see, this fine cloth is lighter than air. Feel the fabric. It is too exquisite to waste on those buffoons at the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Clothing Council. Surely, oh intelligent one, you can feel the delicate weave? These clothes are the future! People will praise your forward-thinking. Don’t worry about the price; we’ll just forward our small fee to your accountant.”

4. TBD

5. “Malarkey! Why don’t you just dress like everyone else?” chimes your gardener through the window, watering the flowers on your desk along with everything and everyone in the room. “It’ll cost the taxpayer less, you’ll be more relatable, and you won’t need to fuss about all that fancy-schmancy stuff! Heck, why not encourage all government officials to wear clothes that are affordable to the average @@DEMONYM@@!”
