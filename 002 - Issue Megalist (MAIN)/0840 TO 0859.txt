[b][anchor=840]#840[/anchor]: Abstinence Makes The Heart Grow Fonder [The Free Joy State; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Parents at West @@CAPITAL@@ High School were furious to discover that teachers belonging to a small evangelical sect ignored national guidelines about comprehensive sex education, instead teaching an abstinence-only programme.

The Debate
1. "How is Little @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ supposed to survive a world of adult pressures without knowing all the facts?" fumes parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@HIS straggly hair hanging limply around @@HIS@@ shoulders. "It's deplorable that so-called educators could leave @@HIM(child)@@ so unprepared for life. Order that all schools teach the standardised and comprehensive curriculum as written, and fire all teachers that refuse!"

2. "The walking mop is correct," attests Miss @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, one of the teachers in question, writing a red 'F' on your hand. "And we tell the youngsters exactly how it is. We show the crippling effects of syphilis; tell them every sexually-active person could have it. We tell them condoms cause rashes; that boys who kiss you will leave. We tell them that some women who have an abortion will never get pregnant again. And we say: only those who join our Purity Club, marrying their one pure and predestined partner can avoid those horrors. For facts, from a correct viewpoint, you must fund our abstinence-only curriculum nationwide."

3. "Immoral purveyors of the perverse!" booms Fly-fornication Yoder, a bushy-bearded member of an obscure order, who is trailed by his black-clad wife and twelve thematically-named children. "The youth hear filthy words – [i]endometrium, oestrogen, epidermis[/i] – and soon they are side-hugging, holding hands, and watching prime-time satire on the [i]Comedy Network[/i]. The One Above is clear: remain pure, knowing nought of the foulness by which infants are begotten until your wedding night. Ban all discussion of the mechanics of reproduction, for @@NAME@@'s moral health."

4. "We could make everyone happy," coos prematurely-grey former-teacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@, @@HIS@@ bug-eyes seeming even larger through a thick pair of round-rimmed spectacles. "I admit, I used to be one of those hip 'withhold nothing' teachers. Then I had kids. The idea of my itty-bitty @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ hearing naughty words, in the name of 'education'? Not on my watch, bucko. Big Government should stop legislating every tiny detail of our kids' school day, and allow schools to teach any sex education curriculum they like: from no-holds-barred to nothing at all. Then parents will be free to choose the school that best suits their needs."

The Issue
Due to a recent spate of acid attacks in @@CAPITAL@@, many @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ are calling upon you to face this growing problem.

The Debate
1. "You need to be exceptionally cruel to carry out these attacks," observes Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, in a cold tone of voice. "A little human empathy would prevent these horrific premeditated crimes, but the monsters who perpetrate these crimes are inherently selfish, and can only understand their own pain, not that of others. So the solution is simple - if someone is convicted of carrying out an acid attack, then before you send them to prison, apply acid to their faces. I think if these evil folk know that they'll be the ones feeling the burn, they'll think twice before acting."

2. "Take care of those already affected by acid attacks," demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an attack victim with a determined look in @@HIS@@ eyes. "Our faces have been marred for the rest of our lives. I've had to face countless operations, and I'm still recovering from the trauma. Some victims have been blinded, some find it hard to get a job because people find it hard to look at them. The government should make sure to fund the surgeries and therapies that an acid victim needs. Economic and social discrimination against victims should be banned. And attackers, they should get life sentences in prison, since that's what us victims experience."

3. "The solution is as plain as the nose on my face," proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a plumber speaking to a crowd of acid attack victims. "The chemicals used in these attacks are very easy to access and obtain. Drain cleaner is the most commonly used fluid in these crimes, and it can be bought cheaply at the nearest store. Outlaw the possession of corrosive substances for everyone except for licensed tradesmen. If people need their pipes unclogged, they must call a professional to handle the situation."

4. "Them harlots deserved it!" writes wanted criminal @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, in a childlike scrawl on bloodstained paper that arrived by old-fashioned post this morning. "Yes, I doused my daughter in acid, and I don't feel any remorse! Women have gotten too uppity, refusing the marriages we arrange for them, or cavorting in public with their naked arms and wanton smiles. Acid cleanses a woman of these wrongs, and reminds her daily of the consequences her unclean actions have wrought."

[b][anchor=842]#842[/anchor]: @@LEADER@@ And The Chocolate Factory [Marilyn Manson Freaks; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Local chocolate factory Wenko's Candy Universe was busted by the police last night. Authorities discovered that it was only able to produce its tasty treats at low, low prices due to a workforce that was comprised of illegal immigrants from Zompaboodaland, a battle-ravaged country that has been mired in a decades-long civil war. The ill-treated workers had been smuggled into @@NAME@@ with the promise of work, and were being forced to "work off their cost of passage."

The Debate
1. A group of men each as tall as your knee stumble into the room and break into song. "Zoompo-boodo-zippity-zoo, master feeds us terrible food. Zoompo-boodo-zippa-dah-deeeeee, if you are bad he will whip ye! What do you get when you eat like a cat? An eating disorder, and that is that! I don't like the taste of it!" The Zompa Boodas hand you a petition asking for all illegal immigrants to be granted amnesty and citizenship, before they are shoveled into a wheelbarrow by your security guard, in order to remove them from your office.

2. "WHAAAAAT?" inquires madman factory owner, Willy Wenko. "These claims are preposterous! My little helpers have their own lives, families, and free will. Furthermore, I pay them plenty!" He turns to the last three little workers still in your office, handing two of them a piece of chocolate each, but grabbing the third around the throat. "So you thought it was a good idea to tell tales, huh? NO RATIONS FOR A WEEK! Ahaha, sorry, that was just a little joke... I beg you, allow me to keep our little factory family together, and let the magic of Wenko Chocolates keep bringing smiles to little children's faces! For the kids, @@LEADER@@, the kids!"

3. "Are you kidding me? This is a no-brainer!" exclaims Immigration Officer Charles Bucket, whose fearless infiltration of the factory was instrumental in busting open the Wenko case. "It is obvious this purple-hatted lunatic was exploiting these people! How would you like it if you were kidnapped by some rich weirdo to work in their factory forever? We need to ship these little folk home immediately!"

[b][anchor=843]#843[/anchor]: Quacking Up [The Free Joy State; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A cancer patient has died after taking the advice of @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME@@ Night, an alternative therapist of dubious qualification. The patient rejected traditional medicine in favor of her 'secret cure', which was revealed to be healing crystals, giving up 'radiation-causing technology', and living on a diet of raw onions. Questions have been raised about whether restrictions should be put on alternative treatments.

The Debate
1. "Poppycock!" scoffs your physician, Doctor @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, raising @@HIS@@ eyebrow witheringly. "These so-called alternative therapies do nothing but destroy the integrity of real medicine, where trained doctors with real degrees – not this nutcase who bought her diploma from an alleyway in Maxtopia – use empirical evidence that's collected over decades. Stop this pillaging of science. Ban these literal snake oil salespeople from peddling false hope and telling the desperate and ill anything for a quick buck!"

2. "Lies and slander!" trills Ms. Night, as she uses a small model of a frowning-face cancer cell as a stress ball. "If this layman is finished, I can explain. All diseases are caused by stress and poor immunity. Even cancer. And all can be cured by removing the stress – those depressing outside influences, that job you never wanted, a nagging family member – and a diet high in immune-boosting antioxidants. Too much stress! That's all there is to it."

3. "The problem is not alternative therapy itself, but rather that it is being promoted as a cure for cancer," declares acupuncturist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while pulling needles out of one of your interns' back. "It is charlatanism on which we must clamp down, including glib peddlers of easy answers such as Ms. Night. The prestigious Medical Association of Brancaland uses acupuncture to relieve the side-effects caused by cancer and its treatments, such as pain and fatigue. We must allow alternative therapists, trained to nationally recognisable standards, to help patients where there is sound evidence that it works."

[b][anchor=844]#844[/anchor]: Essentially On Strike [Socialist Nordia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Disappointed with their current wages and working conditions, disgruntled law enforcement officers have voted for strike action, leaving no one to maintain order. A majority of police officers are now refusing to work until their demands are met, in turn stirring public debate over the ethics of striking by so-called essential workers.

The Debate
1. "My daily commute is being blocked by the same people who are supposed to be protecting us," complains Commodities Analyst @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Criminals are running wild! These officers are guilty of gross dereliction of duty, and should be ashamed of themselves. In fact, they should either get back to work, or be fired immediately. Essential workers have no business risking our lives for their own petty financial gain."

2. "You'd better believe we're upset," snaps Officer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, making no effort to pursue as a pickpocket runs off with your wallet. "We dedicate our lives to keeping the public safe, and must always be vigilant, yet we're paid ridiculously low wages and get about as much respect as the criminals we bring to justice. We have every right to be striking, just like workers in every other industry. Yes, of course, the country is suffering without our services. That's the point. That's why you should grant our requests."

3. "Everyone has a right to strike, but everyone also has a right to essential services," asserts idealistic student and socialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You just have to make sure that there's sufficient funding and training for redundancy to exist within the system, so that essential services can cover for each other at times of industrial action. If ambulance crews are on strike, use fire patrol vehicles and police convoys. If the firefighters are on strike, then deploy the army. If the army goes on strike... well, yeah, that's a toughie. But you get the idea."

[b][anchor=845]#845[/anchor]: A Comedy Of Errors [Kaschovia; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A controversial new 'biography' based on your personal life before your rise to power has proved to be quite popular all over @@NAME@@. While many are calling it comedic drivel, some are taking it quite seriously.

The Debate
1."Everything in that book must be true," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the nation's leading distributor of tin foil hats. "Why else are you denying it so hard? Now we know about the covert and underhanded negotiations you held with Brancaladian gold-smugglers!" @@HE@@ frantically waves a copy of the book in your face. "Tell the truth, @@LEADER@@! You can't hide from it forever! Mandate that all politicians cannot tell a lie."

2."Am I mistaken, or is the author of this book the legendary stand-up comic Jerry Carlin?" points out @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an amateur comedian with a knack for impersonating you. "There is no legitimate reason for concern over a couple of silly jokes. You need to find a sense of humor before one more bad pun lands a comedian in trouble. Comedy is a form of art, not a nuisance to the credibility of politicians and leaders. The government should not have a say on how we tell our jokes."

3."What poppycock!" blasts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your red-faced Press Secretary. "Gullible consumers, which we admittedly know is a large slice of the demographic pie, will eat that thing up and hang on every word!" @@HE@@ takes a breath to scoff and sputter unintelligibly at another passage from the book. "We can't provide a stage for these liars at the expense of your reputation. We must approve everything written about the government before it hits the bookshelves."

4."Or we could just write your official autobiography," advises @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your extremely persuasive Propaganda Minister. "It'll be easy to distribute it to the masses. They wouldn't doubt a single word. Only you should decide what you want the people to know about your life, not some hack comedian with an ax to grind."

[b][anchor=846]#846[/anchor]: Use Your Words [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Shortly after your Finance Minister delivered a rousing speech to shore up support for your latest budget, it was discovered that the majority of the speech was plagiarized from a popular Brancalandian economist.

The Debate
1. "Schools have expelled students for plagiarism; the same rules should apply to the highest offices of the land," notes @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Language Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, looking over a transcript of your latest speech. "Plagiarism is essentially theft, and we ought to take a tougher stance. The Minister should be sacked! Besides, it hardly looks good on you when supposedly expert cabinet ministers are caught stealing content from a second-rate Brancalandian economist." @@HE@@ finishes reading your speech. "Hmm, this speech seems awfully familiar to the one that leader made in that alien invasion movie."

2. "So what if my speech was similar to what some hack economist wrote?" questions your Finance Minister, who hasn't been seen since the speech. "People enjoyed the speech, and support for the budget had gone up! Of course those polls were taken before this so-called scandal, but that's beside the point! People are making way too big a deal of this when there are way more important things for them to be worried about like, um, so how about them..." @@HE@@ trails off. "Let's just ride this out and people will forget about it. At least until the next scandal."

3. "And what kind of message does that send to children?" scolds your personal assistant while tsking the Finance Minister. "It seems to me that the problem is the lack of competent speechwriters. Why not invest in the administrative budget so we can hire some quality people? It may cost an extra @@CURRENCY@@ or two, but it's better than being embarrassed by discount writers who think that [i]Twilight[/i] is the height of literary genius."

4. "You could at least acknowledge me if you're going to use my work," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Brancalandian economist, after wandering away from a tour group. "Or better yet, you could pay me to use my work. Us economists aren't exactly rolling in the dough, you know!"

[b][anchor=847]#847[/anchor]: All The Lonely People [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
@@CAPITAL@@ University researchers have reported that as many as 1 in 3 people in @@NAME@@ may be suffering from chronic loneliness. Studies say this is causing considerable harm to people's health, as dangerous as smoking a pack of cigarettes each day.

The Debate
1. "The problem here is social isolation," observes lead researcher Dr. Elena Rugby, who is plastered with a distracting amount of facial make-up. "Lonely people could just use some government-funded opportunities where they can meet up and chat, get-togethers where they might find the man of their dreams after being left at the altar thirty-two long years ago." She sighs wistfully and averts her gaze.

2. "No, the problem here is perceived social isolation, not actual isolation," interrupts co-researcher Mackenzie Thomas, talking to you via a carefully crafted sock puppet on his right hand. "Mr. Sock here thinks that it'd be better to provide counseling and drugs to brighten up life. You're only alone if you feel alone." He pecks Mr. Sock on the 'cheek' and smiles happily.

[3]. "No, no, the problem here is isolating perceptions of what constitutes socialisation," interjects IT support nerd Doreen Mode, showing a clueless researcher how to turn his computer off and on again. "Two words for you: robot companions. Okay, three words: foxy robot companions. Kit out social services with a few of these, and BAM... job done." [[color=blue]Must have computers[/color] AND [color=purple]Must not have high primitiveness[/color]]

4. "No, no, no! The problem here is that these socialists are attempting to isolate big government solutions," complains socialite Daisy Hawkins, smoothing out her second-hand green velvet jacket. "If you really want people to be less lonely, then cut back income tax a bit, and they'll have more disposable income to get out and meet people. More money equals more happiness!"

5. "No, no, no. And no. The problem here is social isolation being seen as undesirable," comments introvert Ringo Harrison, offering his thoughts softly from behind a pair of face-obscuring sunglasses. "Wouldn't the world be better if everyone just stopped all this inane chatter and got on with some quiet reading? Oh, there's an idea: maybe you could make two hours every evening into no-contact time, where people aren't allowed to talk or interact with each other. That'd be... nice."

[b][anchor=848]#848[/anchor]: It's A Girl Thing [Braskia; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
A commercial for a new childrenswear boutique has been unveiled, sparking debate over gender stereotypes in advertising. It features a young girl ballet-dancing in a rose-pink bedroom, holding a baby-pink toy unicorn and a fluffy cameo-pink magic wand, while wearing matching cotton-candy pink dancing shoes, a tiara and flounced pink tutu.

The Debate
1. "This is explicit sexism for all ages!" cries feminist @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME_1@@, while graffiti-tagging an advert that depicts a woman cheerily vacuuming as her family unwraps their Maxxmas presents. "Don't you see that such stereotypes are harmful to everyone, that you're telling all girls that the only thing they're good for is being beautiful? We've got six-year-old girls who only want to grow up to be pretty. How's that helping to encourage them to be productive citizens? Eliminate ads that perpetuate the lie of gender-specific roles. Allow everyone to grow up as the wonderful, unique individuals they are!"

*2. "You've got to be kidding me," groans Man's World Inc. CEO @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, while uploading a photo of @@RANDOMFEMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@ to the Man's World blog under the heading 'Today's Crazy Lady'. "We use stereotypes because they're what customers want! Girls like pink and enjoy playing house; boys like guns and cars.

Advertisers shouldn't be censored, and normal people who are happy for little girls to be little girls will shop away, happy as clams." [[color=blue]Must have internet[/color]]

*3. "You've got to be kidding me," groans Man's World Inc. CEO @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who's writing copy for his company, the advert for which features a man in a garish shirt being served coffee by a bevy of kneeling maidens.

4. "The impact of ads can be used to our advantage," states your Minister of Niceness @@RANDOM_NAME@@, tutting disapprovingly at Ms. @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@, who is still writing anatomical suggestions of where you might stick the vacuum. "Pay financial incentives to advertisers who depict @@DEMONYM_NOUN_PLURAL@@ in stereotype-shattering roles, so society will become more open-minded. Imagine: women playing exhausting sports, toasting friends in a coffee shop, wiring a plug, administering a company, even growing a beard. And men, too long derided as incompetent homemakers, unafraid to nurture a baby in public, tend a sick parent, or cook a meal. Break antiquated gender roles and protect your citizens' freedom!"

[b][anchor=849]#849[/anchor]: Sky High [Kaschovia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A fleet of drones was recently caught on surveillance cameras delivering over one hundred packages into make-shift nets in back gardens and alleyways. Police managed to intercept only two of these, both of which contained around 20,000 @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ worth of illegal drugs.

The Debate
1. "More drug deals take place right above our heads than anywhere on the ground," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Chief of @@CAPITAL@@ Police Department, fiddling with @@HIS@@ shiny golden badge. "Those modified drones more than double the speed of drug deals, and we just can't move fast enough to catch them! Outlawing drones would obviously be a bit pointless, so why don't we establish our own aerial presence instead? Imagine a fleet of thousands, patrolling with eyes and guns in the sky, protecting and serving the people from on high." @@HE@@ grins and presses play on an MP3 player, filling the room with Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries.

2. "Good job officer, you got us!" mocks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an infamous drug lord from behind a wall of thick smoke and thicker bodyguards. "You'll never keep up, I'm afraid: we'll improvise, adapt, and will always overcome your pathetic enforcers. Take down our drones and we'll find other ways to deliver our wares. So why get caught in this deadly cycle of mutual rising costs? If you were to instead legalise and legitimise our businesses, then we could move into the light, with great customer service, next-day delivery, TV advertising, and yes... we'll even pay taxes. That sound as good to you as it does to me?"

3. "Pardon my interruption, if you will," interrupts @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, a quiet, bespectacled @@MAN@@ perched on a reclining office chair with a thick, undusted stack of city policy rulings on @@HIS@@ lap. "The issue here seems not to be what people do with these modified drones, but who gets to own one. I suggest that all would-be pilots should be put through an intense screening check and criminal records investigation before they can buy a drone. With easily exploitable products comes extensively and unnecessarily over-complicated measures and standards!"

The nation was in shock today after a shooting left dozens dead in downtown @@CAPITAL@@. After the shooter was arrested, a search of @@HIS/HER@@ home revealed that the guns were manufactured by a 3D printer, thrusting the use of the devices into the limelight.

The Debate
1. "These newfangled printers are making it easy for crooks to get their hands on guns!" complains @@CAPITAL@@ Police Chief @@RANDOM_NAME@@, showing you pictures of the armory the shooter had amassed. "I say we ban these dangerous machines, and give the police force a free hand to confiscate any device or materials that can be used to manufacture gun parts. We must reinforce our zero tolerance gun policy and remind our citizens that no guns keeps them safe."

2. "What's stopping citizens from getting the printers or guns on the black market?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a former gun lobbyist who was injured in the attack. "Gun control is impossible with today's technology. If I still had my gun, I wouldn't have a bullet lodged in my shoulder blade. You should legalise guns and let us defend ourselves, and let us use printed guns if that's our preference."

3. "Legalising guns would be anarchy in the streets!" reminds the CEO of electronics giant Pear. "However, 3D printers are quite versatile and useful. I hear some countries are using 3D printers to manufacture artificial organs. Imagine how many lives that would save! All it would take is some generous government funding, and some police oversight, to make sure that this technology is used to help people, not to kill them."

The Issue
The holiday season is commonly regarded as a wonderful time of the year when families can get together, share in good times, and give each other plenty of gifts. Of course, this hasn't gone unnoticed by the corporate sector, as many big-name companies have chosen to begin advertising their holiday-related products many months in advance. This has left many citizens confused, frustrated, and in need of your guidance.

The Debate
1. "This is ludicrous!" shouts one unhappy young adult who somehow managed to stroll into your office, waving around a "New Year's Sale" advertisement that was issued in the month of September. "Why are they telling us about all these Violet-darned holidays so early? It's absolute madness. Pranksgiving hasn't even hit yet and they're talking about Life Day like it was tomorrow! This flagrant consumerism must be stopped. I demand that you make it so companies can only have holiday-relevant advertisements and decorations during the month of the respective holiday."

2. "Let's not get too hasty," states a portly, white-bearded gentleman in jolly attire who claims to be the CEO of a major toy company. "Sometimes people need to take a while to think over what kind of presents they should get for their loved ones. That's why we find it necessary to remind them so early that the holidays are approaching. We just want to give our customers enough time to decide what to buy. You know, maybe you could help by mentioning the upcoming festivities in your speeches. Ho ho ho!"

*3. "I agree that the government should stay out of this," states Lieutenant General @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who dropped by your office to discuss border security. "However, there should be an exception for the holidays that are actually important, such as Military Heroes of the @@TYPE@@ Day. We must mandate that all businesses devote an equal amount of attention to patriotic celebrations as they do the other holidays, like the Feast of Saint Mauve that those Violetists are always going on about.

5. "The capitalist pigs continue to show their true colors!" cries a woman wearing a hammer-and-sickle shirt and waving around a red flag. "All this blatant consumerism is brainwashing the workers into buying their horrible products months in advance. This is how they do business, by leeching off of the hard work of the laborers and pressuring them to buy, buy, buy all throughout the year, holiday or not. @@LEADER@@, you MUST ban all capitalism to ensure that these money-grubbers will be unable to prosper except by serving the masses!"

6. "The blasphemy on display here is completely atrocious!" announces popular televangelist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, adorned in sequined priestly attire. "Truly, these heathenish money-changers only see Maxxmas and the other holidays as a celebration of profits. Our people are forgetting the all-important meaning of this most sacred time of the year.

The Debate
1. "The correct response is obvious," tuts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a highly renowned speech therapist. "All members of the government - yes, even you, @@LEADER@@ - should be forced to take classes on public speaking to improve their speech skills and help them confront their fears.

During your trip to see the premiere of your sister's documentary on the Maxtopian Civil War, your viewing of the film was interrupted by glowing phone screens and obnoxious calls. As it turns out, other citizens often cite this as their biggest pet peeve.

The Debate
1. "Cinema is an art that requires the viewers' silence," begins pretentious movie critic @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as @@HE@@ uses @@HIS@@ fingers to frame the composition of you at your desk. "If so much as one selfish person draws forth one of those devilish glowing rectangles, the audience as a whole breaks its suspension of disbelief! And, well, it's rude.

2. "Why stop at movie theaters?" asks local snob @@RANDOM_NAME@@, well known for hosting extravagant parties. "There's other places where cell phone usage is annoying or rude. In the courthouse, at school, during speeches, or when I'm trying to host a fancy dinner. In fact, @@NAME@@ ought to have a lesson in good manners.

Perhaps then we won't rank just below those boorish Tasmanians in [i]World Travel Magazine[/i]."

3. "What is with all of you?" questions local teenager and film buff @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Screens can't possibly be that disruptive. You do know you can adjust the screen brightness on phones, right? Just, like, let people do what they want in the theater. In fact, maybe you should invest in infrastructure so we have better reception all over @@NAME@@."

[b][anchor=854]#854[/anchor]: An Armoury of Antiques [Vlanlados; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
After furtively photographing a massive military parade in Blackacre, your spies have returned with blurry daguerreotypes of the strangest of war machines. These include large bombs that can take to the air without any visible pilot, aircraft that have no propellers, and rifles that can fire many times without reloading. Concerned generals and army scientists have met to discuss the clear technological edge many nations seem to have over your own.

The Debate
1. "It's quite obvious what the issue here is," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, famed designer of the Mk 1 @@ANIMAL@@, a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ ironclad tank nicknamed the 'sardine cooker' by its crews. "We badly need more great minds in R&D, as it is quite clear that we are currently a little bit behind in war technology. If we can provide higher wages and more incentives for weapon designers and military research, I'm sure that in no time at all we'll have our very own high tech armaments!"

2. "This is a clear indication that we should stick to the old ways," counters retired General @@LASTNAME@@, by telegram. "If we add all these fancy new thingamajigs to our military, our soldiers will become soft! In fact, we should get rid of flying machines and armoured carriages, and focus on what really makes us powerful: spirit, courage, strength, and regiments of ten thousand men standing in a line firing muskets! Just like in the good old days."

[3]. "Look, we need to modernise, but we don't have the infrastructure or expertise to do so," observes your Minister of Trade, trying unsuccessfully to program @@HIS@@ VCR. "Let's just import new weapons from higher tech nations and employ foreign troops to use them for us against our enemies." [[color=blue]Must not have autarky[/color]]

4. "Personally, I see this in a different way," says a fashionable @@MAN@@ wearing a blue cashmere lounge suit and matching beret, who is lounging on your windowsill. "Instead of wasting money on an ineffective military, why don't you shrink the army and spend that money on new ways for people to enjoy themselves: parties for all-comers, new cocktails, new nibbles, and so on. Heck, we should just forget about fighting wars, and focus on what really matters: being the go-to party nation of @@REGION@@."

[b][anchor=855]#855[/anchor]: Thin Evidence [USS Monitor; ed:The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The spread of obesity in @@NAME@@ has fed a cottage industry of weight-loss gimmicks promising immediate results. After your Minister of Health was hospitalised with severe Vitamin B12 deficiency after she tried the [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Beach Miracle Diet[/i], officials are asking you to address the dangers of unhealthy fad diets.

The Debate
1. "A lot of these so-called 'diets' are invented by scam artists who don't know anything about nutrition and don't care about their customers' health," clamours Assistant Director of Public Health @@RANDOM_NAME@@, jabbing the air animatedly with a carrot. "We need tighter regulations to make sure only qualified dieticians can give dietary advice."

2. "What are you talking about?" chortles [i]@@ANIMAL@@ Beach Miracle Diet[/i] spokesperson Catherine Gratwick, as she languidly runs a bony hand through her fine hair. "Thanks to my miracle diet, hundreds of @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ have consciously uncoupled from their body mass. Now they've lost weight, look great, boosted their energy levels, and even improved their hearing! In fact, you should encourage our public-spirited endeavours with a small subsidy to help grow our small businesses. Just think how much nicer our beaches will be when they aren't covered with fat people."

3. "We would never have had this problem in the first place if we'd done a better job of educating our children about proper nutrition," chirrups Ministry of Health Press Secretary @@RANDOM_NAME@@, passing around a 'Get Well Soon' card in the shape of a giant pink rabbit holding a heart. "We need to invest in rigorous culinary arts programs and nutrition science classes in all @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ schools."

4. "You're all thinking too small," exclaims your Minister of Health's overzealous personal assistant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HIS@@ colleagues exchange nervous glances. @@HE@@ pulls a wedge of colorful pamphlets out of @@HIS@@ briefcase and passes them around the conference room. "You can give people all the information in the world, but some just don't listen. The only way to be sure everyone eats healthy is for us to directly control everything they consume. Imagine: food served through government cafeterias, nothing but healthy meals and reasonable portion sizes. Think on it: no obesity and no poverty. Free and wholesome food for all, delivered by the government that cares."

[b][anchor=856]#856[/anchor]: You Got Stones [Abhichandra; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A government-sponsored contest to find the best @@DEMONYMADJECIVE@@ sculptor was wildly successful, with a multitude of statues brought to the Ministry of Culture's marquee at the @@CAPITAL@@ Convention Center. Thanks to some small print in the competition's terms and conditions, the entries are now the property of the Ministry of Culture. Now there are tens of thousands of sculptures to dispose of, many of which are frankly terrible.

The Debate
1. "You must display all these works in a permanent gallery!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a dubiously-talented artist who placed 3587th in the contest. "It doesn't matter if people want to see these sculptures or not, as all art is part of the culture and history of our nation. Like that marble bust of you in the corner of your office, @@LEADER@@ - it's pretty ugly, but we still keep it around."

2. "We should distribute the sculptures en masse to our allies!" suggests @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Foreign Affairs, who you recall 'regifted' your birthday present to @@HIM@@ back to you last year. "They'll feel obliged to accept in order to maintain diplomatic politeness. And hey, what's so bad about spreading @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ culture around the world?"

3. "We should just demolish 'em," urges construction site fore@@MAN_1@@ @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@, grabbing a delicate-looking ceramic anaglyptic and breaking it over @@HIS@@ knee for emphasis. "All we need is your permission, and an empty lot, and half-a-dozen bulldozers and steamrollers."

4. "Or we could repurpose these items," suggests your DIY-loving Uncle @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME, wearing a pair of dungarees he improvised from rubber bands and reclaimed umbrella fabric. "We can knock together all sorts of useful items if we put our minds to it: big paperweights, weights for the gym, weights to keep doors open, mobile phone cases... that weigh a lot. The choices are endless! Well, not exactly endless, but you know what I mean!"

[b][anchor=857]#857[/anchor]: Are You There God Particle? It's Me, @@LEADER@@ [Sedgistan; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
After a scientific experiment involving a cat, a steel chamber and a vial of radioactive waste went disastrously wrong - and led to the death of the cat to boot - people have begun to question whether the nation's pursuit of knowledge has caused it to lose touch with its humanity.

The Debate
1. "It's time we got a grip on ourselves," demands Dr. @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Schrödinger, clearing away flasks of hydrocyanic acid. "It's bad enough that the cat was lost, but even worse, the entire east wing of the Maxford University building has been irradiated! That'll set the Experimental Physics department back for decades. And all for what? To disprove an obscure theory of quantum mechanics. It's high time we had a central authority to vet research to ensure its integrity... and well, since my department is out of action, I humbly volunteer."

2. "It's time we got a grip on our goals," insists Dr. @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Milgram, affixing a set of electrodes on your secretary before handing you a large red button. "If we don't ask ourselves the fundamental questions, then what do we amount to but apes scratching around in the dirt with sticks? We need more freedom - and funding, of course - to have a hope of advancing our knowledge. Now press the button, please.

*3. "It's time we got a grip on our souls," begins noted astronomer @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Newton while winding up his pocket watch. "I agree with the good Dr. Schrödinger that there needs to be a central authority. Not a man-made one, but rather divine. The noble study of science needs to be brought back to its holy roots. It's about understanding His holy creation, not torturing small animals. Give the church full domain of our scientific pursuits so that we may bring our glorious nation back on the right side of the Lord." [[color=blue]Religion is legal[/color]]

*4. "It's time we got a grip on our souls!" cries a cloaked figure brandishing a geocentric map from a shadowy corner of your office. "You ruthlessly eradicated religious thought from our once-venerable nation and now you are reaping what you sow! There is only one choice for you, @@LEADER@@: the righteous one. Bring @@NAME@@ back into the glory of His kingdom. Scientific pursuits need not be abandoned, only tempered." [[color=red]Religion is illegal[/color]]

5. "It's time we realized there is nothing to grip," stoically states an unwashed ascetic outside your window. "Scientific pursuits are just man's ego trying to overcome the oneness of nature. Only when we succumb to mother nature and stop fighting her will we attain inner peace." An apple falls on @@HIS@@ head from the tree. @@HE@@ continues unfazed, "No more science. No more inquiries. No more questions. No more struggles."

[b][anchor=858]#858[/anchor]: Reporting For (Jury) Duty [Nation of Quebec; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A Bigtopian defendant standing accused in a high profile murder trial criticised the randomly-selected jury assigned to as being biased against him, observing that the twelve included two known anti-immigrant agitators, a man-hating misandrist, a boy he bullied at school, and his estranged father. Concerns have arisen regarding how juries are selected.

The Debate
1. "It is possible for random selection to generate biased juries," states statistician @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who is about the only person who is actually excited to be called for jury duty. "We need a process to screen out biased prospects from juries, and aim to actively create balanced and fair juries that are representative of the values of the nation as a whole."

2. "It's the patriotic duty of every citizen to participate in juries," reminds your Justice Minister. "The fact that some people think of creative excuses to get out of it is offensive to say the least. We need to make jury duty mandatory for all citizens, and make the randomized selection the final selection. Picking and choosing jurors is too prone to corruption and legal manipulation, no matter how well-intentioned the selection process may be."

3. "Why have juries at all?" questions Judge @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ still clutching @@HIS@@ gavel from this morning's court session. "It's a proven fact that the majority of cases are already decided by who gets selected rather than by the evidence presented. All jurors have some subconscious bias that a questionnaire won't catch. All sentencing should be handled by a judge. The random person on the street probably has no idea how the criminal justice system works in @@NAME@@, so why not leave it to the professionals?"

[4]. "@@HIS_1@@ Honour Judge @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME_1@@ has a point. All human beings are susceptible to bias more than they realize," suggests tech enthusiast @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who famously augmented @@HIM@@self with robotic arms. "How many times has a jury convicted someone who was obviously innocent or vice versa because they were emotionally persuaded by the attorney? On the other hand, computers don't base their decision on emotions. They make decisions only on logic and cold hard facts. I propose that all courts should be run by automated systems that will leave no room for error." [[color=red]Must not have computers[/color] OR [color=red]Must have Body Integrity[/color]]

[b][anchor=859]#859[/anchor]: A Cola by Any Other Name [Jutsa; ed: Caracasus][/b]

The Issue
An all-out fizzy soda war between the ancient Eckie-Cola and the younger, but significantly larger, Eckie-Ecola appears to be almost inevitable following Eckie-Ecola's decision to print their already similar labels an identical shade of pink. This has rendered visual distinction between the two brands rather difficult. As usual, you have been called in to mediate before the streets run red with cherry soda.

The Debate
1. "This is outrageous!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the representative of Eckie-Cola, as @@HE@@ slams one of @@HIS@@ company's products onto your desk. "We've been around in @@NAME@@ far longer than that Eckie-Ecola has been, even if they are more popular at the moment! This is a clear breach of our trademark and we demand that they change their name and logo! We deserve the sole rights to our title and any variations thereof!"

2. "That is outrageous!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the representative of Eckie-Ecola, also slamming a can of Eckie-Cola onto your desk, having mistaken it for one of @@HIS@@ company's own products. "So what if they came up with the name first? Everyone loves our products - we turn over way more product than those Eckie-Cola losers! What's the point of trademarks if they're getting in the way of consumer choice?"

3. "You two are outrageous," calmly mutters avid health enthusiast @@RANDOM_NAME@@, placing a kale smoothie on your desk. "Have you any idea how much sugar there is in a single can of these death-colas? And don't get me started on the preservatives! All sodas should be packaged in grey cans that specifically detail all of their contents and the hazards that come with them. That will hopefully lead to a community that is more health-conscious as well as knowledgeable."
