[b][anchor=900]#900[/anchor]: Piracy on the High Trees [Ransium; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Both a popular ornamental and a prized source of lumber, the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ cherry tree, has spiked in value due to @@NAME@@’s recent bespoke furniture craze. Coincidentally, there has also been a spike in bandit lumberjacks surreptitiously stealing shade trees from residences in the middle of the night.

The Debate
1. “The streets are filled with chainsaws right now and it’s frankly disgusting,” growls gruff detective @@RANDOMNAME@@, while photographing a branch from a fresh crime scene. “The other day I saw a bunch of flannel-clad hooligans walking to the park, each one chainsaw in hand, and I couldn’t do anything. Create a chainsaw registry, linking each saw owner to a chainsaw’s unique wear patterns, and I promise you we’ll have this crime wave licked faster than you can say ‘timber’.”

2. “Willful waste, makes woeful want,” chides noted antiques dealer @@RANDOMNAME@@. “We already have plenty of perfectly good furniture in @@NAME@@. We just need to revitalize the art of upholstery repair. The government should sponsor restoration classes and subsidize the sale of refurbished furniture. It would also allow for some reasonable environmental regulations to help preserve the trees before they’re gone.”

*3. “The problem, I’m afraid, is capitalism,” declares @@RANDOMNAME@@, a noted socialist thinker. “If we just nationalized the ownership of all trees there’d be no question as to which trees were harvested legally since only the government could harvest them. Furthermore, we’d be assured that all the forestry in @@NAME@@ is sustainable because we’d be the ones doing it. Who else can @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ possibly trust to handle these important matters besides the government?” [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*4. “The problem, I’m afraid, is a lack of capitalism,” declares @@RANDOMNAME@@, a noted capitalist thinker. “Government control of the timber market has left there to be too much pent-up demand. If we privatized the timber industry the invisible hand would find the proper price, which would dry up the black market that is driving this theft. Actually the same could be said for other Bob The Great Builder industries.” [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

5. “Wha’ be th’ problem?” ask notorious logger, Captain William Ash, who, after losing a hand in a rumored chainsaw duel, had it replaced with a handsaw. “We... er... Th’ pirate loggers are jus’ usin’ a valuable resource that those homeowners were wastin’ as shade trees. Once trees get t’ a merchantable size, anyone best be able t’ log them no matter whose land they be on. ‘N if anyone disagrees I’ll send them t’ Davy Jones’ locker!”

[b][anchor=901]#901[/anchor]: You Buy That? [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
In the webgame [i]Surreal Estates[/i], players pay a fee to buy a patch of pixels on a gigantic map of the Moon and build virtual “moon kingdoms”. Part of their marketing strategy includes deliberately misleading advertising, with web banners and a serious-looking website selling “designated plots of lunar land for your own piece of the moon” while minimizing emphasis on the property being virtual rather than real. A group of new users has filed a class action lawsuit against the company, claiming that the game designers are systematically cheating customers out of their money.

The Debate
1. “This is a blatant fraud! The stupid Terms and Conditions were buried in one corner of the website, in illegible yellow-on-white 3-point font size!” whines @@RANDOMNAME@@, showing you the 3D images of a lunar mansion flanked by palm trees on @@HIS@@ laptop. “I spent hundreds of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ on ten acres of lunar land, thinking this was a great bargain. But all I got was a lousy virtual space to build a lousy virtual home with lousy virtual bricks! Misled customers should be given a full refund, and websites should be responsible for providing unmistakably clear disclaimers.”

2. “The Terms and Conditions are legally sound; we had our lawyers draft something suitably mislea... watertight,” defends @@RANDOMNAME@@, the CEO of [i]Surreal Estates.[/i] “This is just a game for a nice virtual Moon colonization experience, and even children can understand that! Contract law is the foundation of stable society and economic growth - don’t jeopardise that just because some fools don’t read things before agreeing to them. Incidentally, they’re free to cancel their subscriptions, though there’s a small exit fee and some mandatory secondary economic commitments that go with that...”

3. While you are discussing this, a pop-up message appears on your computer desktop. “You now have the chance to contribute to building a space colony on the Moon, and all you need to do is to provide us with the permissions required by law so that we might embark on this thrilling adventure that will take our scientific advancement to new heights! Please read these terms and conditions of use carefully before accessing, using, or obtaining any materials, information, products, or services. By agreeing to the terms and conditions, you grant The Lunatic Mission® access to all your personal data, and agree to subscribe to our services, including the Lunar Real Estate Service®, Lunar Transportation Service®, and Lunar Insurance Service®. You hereby grant The Lunatic Mission® the exclusive right to organize, conduct, and cancel all space missions to be launched from @@NAME@@, and agree to provide stable funding for all missions, with the exact amount to be paid being specified in Clause 4.116 of this document...” Scrolling to the end after several thousand more words, you see a button marked ‘I AGREE.’

The Issue
Teen pop-sensation ‘Justyn’ is dead, and the police investigation into his brutal murder-by-decapitation has revealed that it was a contract killing, organised through a highly professional ‘dark web’ assassination firm.

The Debate
1. "This talentless teeny-bopper's pop music may have been criminally bad, but he didn't deserve the death penalty!" jokes online video blogger and police academy dropout @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Clearly law enforcement is struggling with modern technology. @@LEADER@@, if you're watching, take my advice: spend some money on a decent Cyber Crimes division. Fill it with people who might have failed a stupid physical test, but who have tech-savvy and brains. Oh, and in case you're wondering, yes I'd love to join up!"

*2. "You can't police the internet short of shutting it down, and only a loony would suggest that could be an option.  People need to defend themselves at the moment of attack!" asserts [i]Tasers'n'Lasers[/i] rep @@RANDOMNAME@@, via streamed video-link.  "Crazy regulations about so-called 'reasonable force' are holding us back.  Let the free market arm the people, so that a free people can freely defend themselves!  Though obviously, ahem, not for free." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**4. "[i]Bonjour[/i]!" interjects Victor Reno, a dignified-looking gent who you thought was just a cleaner, as he places a handgun on your desk with its barrel pointing towards you.  "The [i]OneClickDeath Corporation[/i] sends its greetings.  We would like you to legalise our little enterprise, so we can move from the dark web and into the light of legitimate business, death merchant apps and micropayment mutilations.  We would allow you to create a small excluded target list, and will always be fastidious with tax payments.  Just think on it."  He departs, leaving the handgun on the table. [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**5. “[i]Bonjour[/i]!” interjects Victor Reno, a dignified-looking gent who you thought was just a cleaner, as he places a handgun on your desk with its barrel pointing towards you. “[i]OneClickDeath Industries[/i] sends its greetings. We would like you to legalise and nationalise our little project, so we can move from the dark web and into the light of state-sanctioned slaughter, Marxism-motivated murder and anti-capitalist decapitations. We would gladly operate from a centrally-administered target list, in return for favoured positions within the People’s Communist Party. Just think on it.” He departs, leaving the handgun on the table. [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

[b][anchor=903]#903[/anchor]: Every Breath You Take [Ransium; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
While another treacherous dissident was being dragged off to execution for not applauding with adequate fervor during your last national address, @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Law and Order, happened to overhear him yell, “The @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ government might as well outlaw breathing next!” Upon hearing this, @@HE@@ immediately rushed to your office, where @@HE@@ now stands with a wicked smile on @@HIS@@ face.

The Debate
1. “Why didn’t I think of this sooner?” asks the Minister, bouncing up and down on @@HIS@@ tiptoes. “With a law against breathing on the books and a bit of selective enforcement, this will be a panacea. We won’t have to bother with the work of spying and coming up with trumped-up charges; anyone that we have the faintest inkling of being disloyal can simply be arrested for violating the breathing statute and be done with it.”

2. “Maybe the fact that we’re even considering this says that @@NAME@@ has gotten just a tiny bit too... uh... authoritarian,” whispers @@RANDOMNAME@@, a low-level aide, while shaking uncontrollably with fear. “Maybe we could give the people just a tiny bit more freedom of thought and the like? I’m not talking anything too radical. I love your glorious regime as much as the next @@DEMONYM@@, but maybe a bit of exchange of ideas between citizens could make it even better?” @@HE@@ glances at your Minister of Law and Order nervously, and then hastily continues. “Or not. Whatever you think is best! Gotta run!”

3. “While I don’t support outlawing breathing outright, I do think there’s something to this,” states @@RANDOMNAME@@, a cranky old @@MAN@@ who has somehow wandered into your office. “Like those annoying mouth-breathers sitting next to you just gasping away while you’re trying to enjoy a quiet cup of coffee. Or those neighbors that keep you up all night with their loud snoring. No, breathing is fine; just make sure everyone keeps it quiet.”

[b][anchor=904]#904[/anchor]: Yours Insincerely [Nation of Quebec; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Whenever disaster strikes @@NAME@@, politicians have a habit of sending their “thoughts and prayers” to the victims. Although the gesture is appreciated by some, there are many who feel that the phrase is simply an excuse for politicians to do nothing.

The Debate
1. “Every time I hear a politician send their ‘thoughts and prayers’ I feel like vomiting in my mouth,” complains social commentator @@RANDOMNAME@@, forcefully shredding a newspaper reporting your Minister of Transportation sending prayers for the victims of a train disaster. “If you ask me, that’s their way of getting out of actually doing anything meaningful to help the victims. How about sending some much-needed aid when there’s a disaster? Or perhaps investing in some infrastructure? The people want government action, not empty platitudes.”

2. “On the contrary, many people have told me that they have found comfort in my words when they needed it most,” replies @@RANDOMNAME@@, a politician who has been known to fall asleep during government ceremonies. “There’s nothing odious or lazy with sending out thoughts and prayers. Some people find it helpful to be reminded that their government cares. What’s wrong with that?”

[3]. “I agree, but we should go even further,” replies @@RANDOMNAME@@, a famously-vociferous preacher belonging to the @@CAPITAL@@ chapter of @@FAITH@@. “We should have a national day of prayer and mourning whenever disaster strikes @@NAME@@. The government and @@FAITH@@, standing hand in hand, can help lead @@NAME@@ into a new era of unity and healing. What’s that? There’s people who don’t practice @@FAITH@@? A pox on their houses!” [[color=purple]Must have a national faith[/color] AND [color=blue]Must not be a theocracy[/color]]

4. “Since when should the government be in the business of spreading this religious indoctrination?” fumes atheist media personality @@RANDOMNAME@@. “Thoughts and prayers? Oh, please! This is nothing more than the government imposing its religious beliefs on everyone else. How about the government back off with this propaganda and let people mourn in their own private way?”

[b][anchor=905]#905[/anchor]: Stage Directions [The Free Joy State; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Angry moralists, and some confused tourists who seemed to think they were waiting for tickets, picketed outside irreverent rock opera Jimmy Bouncer: The Musical. They claim it contained blasphemy, misogyny, racial intolerance, adult situations, and an inappropriate alternate rhyme scheme.

The Debate
1. “I wish... I wish that theatre would be purer. I wish the actors were demurer,” rants protestor and member of evangelical pressure group Many Moral Mummies, @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@. “I wish wolves had no hidden meaning, that faith suffered no demeaning, that writers weren’t so left-leaning... I wish so many things. Into the future, we should look at introducing censorship. Into the future, we need penalties for those who would pervert it. Into the future, let’s guarantee nice plays that little kids could see. The future’s here; it only needs for you and me to grasp it.”

2. “Hello, my name is @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ Pryce, and I would like to share with you the most amazing dream,” chimes a perky actor, as @@HE@@ places @@HIS@@ headshot on your desk. “A dream of paradise, a great street paved with gold, lined with theatres and dreamers and the tales that are told. We can defend free expression rights; a night nestled in a theatre seat could change a life! So come with us, support our happy troupe, and let the theatre district grow.”

3. “Friend, you’re closing your eyes to the real situation you don’t want to acknowledge,” observes curmudgeonly theatre critic @@RANDOMNAME@@, who has written acerbic reviews panning the previous two speakers. “Maybe you’re not aware of the calibre of disaster indicated by the presence of rock’n’roll here in your community. That’s Rock with a capital ‘R’, and Roll with the same ‘R’. To keep the young ones moral, you’ve got to wind it back to something more wholesome. Church choirs, songs of praise and partsong. Rock’n’roll can roll on by.”

4. “Slowly, sadly, theatre lost its splendour,” intones a cloaked figure from the shadows. “Grasp it, change it, scrap the worst offender. Turn your face away from this modern dross today. The music’s over-written and it’s trite. Revive some grand old theatre shows tonight.”

[b][anchor=906]#906[/anchor]: Internet Killed the Television Star [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Television viewership is at an all-time low. Even popular soaps like [i]As @@REGION@@ Spins[/i] have been rapidly losing viewers. The culprit? More and more citizens have cut the cord and turned to the internet as their primary source of entertainment.

The Debate
1. “The solution is obvious!” states wealthy television executive @@RANDOMNAME@@, who barely glances at the WhoTube video playing on your laptop. “The government needs to make it tougher for people to cut the cord. Why not tax the internet? Streaming services like Webflix are notoriously unregulated. The government should regulate them the way they regulate television. The entertainment industry is vital to the economy, and we need to encourage people to watch more television, not less.”

2. “Forcing people to use something they don’t enjoy seems rather draconian,” muses fantasy writer @@RANDOMNAME@@, who has worked on many episodes of the critically acclaimed Webflix adaption of Hexicon. “The better solution would be for the government to invest in the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ entertainment industry, so they can hire more writers and have a bigger budget to work with. That will get people’s butts back on the couches!”

3. “Remember when everyone thought radio was going to be the next big thing?” asks WhoTube celebrity The Nostalgia Nerd, donning his trademark pocket protector and loosened red tie. “Change is an important part of the industry, and online entertainment is the next big thing. Each of my videos get over a million views, and I think this is something the government should notice. Why not invest in a program to teach young people how to become successful WhoTube stars? Not only will this give consumers more viewing choice, you’ll also help tackle youth unemployment. Granted, not everyone will make it big, but them’s the breaks!”

*4. “The internet is a cesspool of violence and perversion, and television isn’t much better!” declares infamous social conservative activist @@RANDOMNAME@@, who unsuccessfully tried to ban the raunchy sitcom The Flimpsons. “That’s not even getting into the trolling, identity theft, and hacking that the internet festers. The government must ban the internet, and better censor television so that it aligns with @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ family values.” [[color=purple]Must lean towards being secular[/color]]

*5. “The internet and television are an unregulated cesspool of violence, sex, and profane language!” declares infamous moral crusader @@RANDOMNAME@@, who unsuccessfully tried to ban the raunchy sitcom [i]The Flimpsons[/i]. “The only joy one should get is that from the Creator! The government must ban the internet, and better regulate television, so that the good people of @@NAME@@ can cleanse their sins and gain their entertainment from what really matters... finding peace with the Creator!” [[color=purple]Must lean towards being religious[/color]]

[b][anchor=907]#907:[/anchor] A Problem Shared [Singapore no2; ed: ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Bike-sharing organisations in @@NAME@@ are facing a bump in the road: inconsiderate users. From theft to vandalism, irresponsible users are forcing bikes to be replaced at unprecedented rates. The future looks bleak for bike-sharing, and without some swift intervention, the sound of bike bells across the nation’s cities may be consigned to distant memory.

The Debate
*1. “The misuse of our bikes must stop!” exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, the CEO of Cycology Degrees, an urban bike-sharing franchise, @@HIS@@ two-wheeler tracking mud across your expensive carpet as @@HE@@ parks it against your bookcase. “It is essential that the police are given the resources to catch and punish citizens who damage or disappear our bicycles. Otherwise, our burgeoning bike-sharing scene will collapse even before it has taken off.” [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. “The misuse of our bikes must stop!” exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, the Commissioner of the Committee of Communist Communal Commuting Commodities, @@HIS@@ two-wheeler tracking mud across your expensive carpet as @@HE@@ parks it against your bookcase. “It is essential that the police are given the resources to catch and punish citizens who damage or disappear our bicycles. Otherwise, our burgeoning bike-sharing scheme will fold even before it takes off.” [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

**3. “Clearly, this is a failure of the private sector,” claims @@RANDOMNAME@@, the Minister of National Development, adjusting @@HIS@@ red beret. “If such enterprises were to be nationalised, we could ensure that all bicycles used meet safety and security standards. By retrofitting every bike in the land with theft-proof components, auto-locking mechanisms and GPS tracking systems, we’ll be able to ensure no bicycle will ever be stolen or tampered with again.” [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**4. “Clearly, this is a job for the free market,” claims @@RANDOMNAME@@, the Minister of Alternative Solutions, adjusting @@HIS@@ tie. “If such organisations were privatised, they would be motivated to protect their bicycles - and their profit margin - and would likely fit their bikes with auto-locking mechanisms, theft proof components and other effective measures. I mean sure, we’ll have to end Communism, but that’s no big thing is it?” [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

[5]. “Got to say, all those extras sound kind of bulky,” observes Rosalia Yates, who smells faintly of petrol. “You probably ought to allow bikes to have some sort of on-board motive dynamo to help with that weight, maybe one or two extra wheels for stability, a vertical column and wheel steering system, and some sort of metal casing to protect the rider and all the delicate parts. In fact, with the extra power on board, you could also put some passenger seats in.” [[color=red]Cars are illegal[/color]]

6. “Nonsense! What those bike-sharing organisations actually require are more easily replaceable stock,” argues origami-lover @@RANDOMNAME@@, passing you a folded paper unicorn of unknown significance. “Inexpensive eco-friendly cardboard bikes would surely save loads of money, are entirely safe, and are fully waterproof and fire-resistant. If it wasn’t for user scepticism, we’d have been using them long ago. You could encourage their use by banning metal bikes, and with a few business subsidies.”

[b][anchor=908]#908:[/anchor] The Forbidden Fruit [Singapore no2; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The Prime Minister of the massive agricultural nation of Ausblic has sent you a rather unconventional gift: five thousand fruit baskets worth 100 @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ each. Now, crates of fruit baskets occupy almost all available space in your office.

The Debate
1. "Do you like our gift, @@LEADER@@?" enquires the Prime Minister of Ausblic, @@RANDOMNAME@@, wandering through the maze of fruit baskets only to find your face hidden by a huge pineapple. "We wish to improve ties with @@NAME@@, and what better way than by offering a sample of Ausblic's main export? If you can't finish eating all five thousand baskets worth of fruit, I'm sure that you could sell some of them back to the market with a significant markup. Just a suggestion."

2. "Nice try, but our leader is incorruptible!" snarls your devoted Home Secretary @@RANDOMNAME@@, @@HIS@@ @@LEADER@@ is Love, @@LEADER@@ is Life T-shirt visible through @@HIS@@ shirt. "We must destroy all of these odious offerings, and show that we have zero tolerance of graft. Harsh punishments must be given to anyone who tries to bribe government officials. Only then will our glorious nation be free of corruption!"

3. "That's taking it a little too far," states @@RANDOMNAME@@, the Minister of the Middle Ground, who is standing between the previous two speakers to keep them apart. "We could permit politicians to receive small gifts, inconsequential sums totalling a maximum of 50 @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ per person, per annum. Any previous gifts received that are worth more than the amount stated, like those fruit baskets, should be donated to charity. Imagine the needy people of @@NAME@@, delightedly waiting for succour as you donate all the things you don't even need."

*4. "What you call bribes, I call political donations," divulges politician @@RANDOMNAME@@, who hefts a suitcase that is bursting with cash. "Getting into public office takes millions of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@, and the average citizen cannot afford to do so.

The Issue
At the start of the Marche Noire Civil War, @@RANDOMNAME_1@@ moved @@HIS@@ family to the relative safety of @@NAME@@. @@HE@@ stayed behind so that @@HE@@ could wind down @@HIS@@ engineering business and make sure the children in the orphanage @@HE@@ ran all made it to safety. @@HIS@@ plan to rejoin @@HIS@@ family was thwarted, however, when you instituted the immigration ban.

The Debate
1. “The pain this poor @@MAN@@ has gone through is astounding!” claims the author of the article that made @@LASTNAME_1@@ a national story. “This @@MAN@@ had to escape death camps in Marche Noire and the blazing sun in Althaniq in search of freedom, only to be separated from @@HIS@@ family by you. Whatever their nationality, we shouldn’t be a country that divides families. Lift the ban on immigration!”

2. “@@NAME@@ shouldn’t divide families, no,” remarks nationalist politician @@RANDOMNAME@@, while munching on a piece of Willy Wenko’s best chocolate. “However, we must fight to maintain our national identity, and immigration will only undermine this. Let’s re-unite the families of people like @@NAME_1@@ - by sending them and their families back to wherever it is they came from!”

3. “Well, this is quite the dilemma, isn’t it?” interjects @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Finding Loopholes, looking up from a copy of the latest tax plan. “We don’t like immigrants, but we can’t be the nation that divides families, and we shouldn’t deport people who came here legally. I’ve got it! Let’s allow immigration, but only to the relatives of citizens.”

[b][anchor=910]#910[/anchor]: A for Effort [Orgrua; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
A home-schooled student with perfect grades was kicked out of @@CAPITAL@@ University after failing the first semester.

The Debate
1. “This is not fair!” berates @@RANDOMNAME@@, the student’s mom, her face turning the color of beetroot as she glares at you accusingly. “How can colleges kick out a student after they’ve enrolled? It’s as if they don’t believe the grades I gave him! My little cherub worked so hard in his high school years, and now it’s all for nothing. @@LEADER@@, you must make it a law that colleges cannot boot out anyone after they’ve been accepted.”

2. “Do you see these papers?” asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, the university’s admissions counsellor. “Copies of rejection letters sent to applicants who were declined a space because of this sub-par student! I think that we need to take some serious measures to make sure that home-schooled students have their grades checked and verified by the state.”

3. TBD

4. “Why are college entrance criteria so elitist anyway?” enquires @@RANDOMNAME@@, an intern who has just completed a college paper on socialism. “Why not just make going to college mandatory for every @@DEMONYM@@? College education should be free for all until the age of 24. Yes, it will require a boost in taxation to pay for it, but everyone will surely appreciate their government-funded master’s degree.”

[b][anchor=911]#911[/anchor]: For Crying Out Loud [Drasnia; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
A large portion of @@ANIMAL@@ City was recently consumed by a raging fire. A newly-published report investigating the unprecedented scale of the disaster revealed that the town crier was home sick, which made it impossible for the town’s citizens to coordinate an emergency response.

The Debate
1. “I can’t take it anymore,” rasps one of @@CAPITAL@@’s criers, @@RANDOMNAME@@, as @@HE@@ puts a throat lozenge in @@HIS@@ mouth. “I’m always expected to be awake in case something happens and to shout from the rooftops so all can hear. Just a few nights ago, I fell from my roof and nearly broke my leg! We must bring back telephones so people like me can get a good night’s sleep.”

2. “Certainly our emergency response needs some work,” agrees your Minister of Technology @@RANDOMNAME@@, a noted Luddite, “but telephones are not the answer. We must increase funding to hire more town criers so they can work in short shifts that do not strain their bodies. Furthermore, a series of semaphore towers across the nation must be constructed for timely communication in case of a national emergency.”

3. A strange man who introduces himself as Doctor Howe bursts into your office. “You must have telephone booths on the streets! It’s a matter of life and death! If you’re worried about people using them frivolously for gossip, we can always set them up so they only connect to emergency services. That way you can have the instant response of phones without all the hassle of people talking on them all the time.”

[b][anchor=912]#912[/anchor]: Ambassadors Behaving Madly [Nation of Quebec; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
The privilege of diplomatic immunity for ambassadors has entered the news after several of them have been caught in unsavory behavior, including drunk driving, fist fights, and the attempted murder of a Brancalandian Member of Parliament. Concerned citizens and outraged foreign nationals have asked your government to step in and bring your ambassadors in line.

The Debate
1. “The solution is quite simple,” states your Minister of Foreign Affairs while trying to smooth things over with @@HIS@@ Brancalandian counterpart. “Why don’t we simply fire any ambassador who acts like a buffoon? We obviously can’t have our diplomats acting like spoiled children and besmirching our good name. We must replace them with the most upstanding members of society. Problem solved!”

2. “That still doesn’t change the fact that your ambassador tried to kill one of our MPs!” replies the Brancalandian Foreign Minister, who has started a slap fight with your own Minister of Foreign Affairs. “I demand that all ambassadors have their diplomatic immunity revoked so that we can charge them for all of the crimes they have committed. No person should be above the law! To make it fair, we wouldn’t complain if you also took away immunity from all of the foreign diplomats in @@NAME@@.”

3. “Being a diplomat is so stressful,” complains @@RANDOMNAME@@, your former ambassador to Tasmania, who has taken it upon @@HIM@@self to stop the fighting between the two ministers. “You send us off to these dangerous hellholes all across @@REGION@@. Is it any wonder that some of us snap? Our job is to promote the nation’s interests and help find new allies. We need diplomatic immunity to ensure our safety as national envoys, guarantee our freedom of movement, and maybe let off some steam on the weekends. I think a little international embarrassment is a small price to pay for that.”

4. “Ambassadors! Bah! Who needs them?” questions infamous nationalist and staunch xenophobe @@RANDOMNAME@@ while giving a salute that makes everyone in the room uncomfortable. “This compulsive need to learn about other countries or grant their diplomats safe passage is very un-@@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@. We’d be much better off keeping to ourselves and not having to worry about these damn foreigners or their opinions on how we conduct our business.”

5. “Diplomatic immunity, you say?” muses @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Sycophancy. “Why should this just be limited to ambassadors? It seems to me that if anyone deserves immunity, it’s you. You’re practically a god to these people anyway. You should be able to do whatever you want.”

[b][anchor=913]#913[/anchor]: Couped Up [Allahad; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Outrage echoes through the hallowed halls of government. Your ungrateful Minister of the Interior claims you are an autocrat and has been drumming up support for a coup.

The Debate
1. “Come now, Leader, surely you see that this is all a misunderstanding,” coos Minister of the Interior @@RANDOMNAME_1@@, massaging your shoulders. “I think our problem is a failure to communicate. You never listen to anyone’s ideas but your own anymore. I felt sidelined. Our relationship needs to be more of a two-way street, or it just won’t work. Politics can’t be all me-me-me. How about I promise to stop trying to overthrow you, you promise to listen more, and we all turn over a new leaf. How does that sound?”

2. “Are you serious?” cries Minister of Defence @@RANDOMNAME@@, as @@HE@@ sits in the corner beheading toy soldiers. “Traitors are the lowest form of scum and should be treated as such. Many could have died in this proposed mutiny, not to mention that they were trying to deliberately oust the nation’s rightful leader! We must treat this @@MAN_1@@ as the dangerous and unstable individual @@HE_1@@ is, and punish @@HIM_1@@ in the only correct way for treasonous pond-life: by hanging, drawing and scattering @@HIS@@ wicked body to the four winds for the birds to feast upon. Or, you could just chop @@HIS@@ head off if you’re feeling generous.”

3. “There is always another way around these matters,” hisses the Secret Police’s Head of Scientific Cunning, @@RANDOMNAME@@. “Merely pretend you agree and go for a drink with the traitor. My employees and I have found a new type of poison; it’s completely undetectable and perfectly mimics a heart attack, disappearing from the bloodstream within several hours. Slip this into any beverage and the drinker won’t be at work the next morning. The poor Minister is getting on in years, anyway. And what with all the negative press coverage about @@HIS_1@@ being a disgusting traitor... perhaps the stress was simply too much to handle?”

The Issue
Religious attendance has hit rock bottom and many formerly thriving houses of faith are now abandoned. City planners have called a meeting to discuss the topic and, to their surprise, more people came to the meeting than to all religious services in the last year combined.

The Debate
1. “You know what would be really cool?” asks your nephew’s hip best friend. “If you’d turn all of these structures into something meaningful, like skate parks! These buildings are virtually perfect for half-pipes all along the halls! Can you think of any better place to do some sick flips than in a repurposed temple? And there would be some health benefits for young people, right?”

2. “Mind your manners!” snaps a grey-haired @@MAN@@ in a lab coat as @@HE@@ slams a ruler on the skater’s head. “For centuries, houses of worship were epicenters of indoctrination and persecution. What could be more fitting than to turn them into beacons of knowledge? These structures would certainly be a good place to expand @@CAPITAL@@ University’s library. Furthermore, I can think of at least a dozen colleagues who are looking for a place to run a lab in.”

3. “Instead of wasting them on mad scientists, why don’t we turn these spaces into affordable housing?” suggests @@RANDOMNAME@@, parent of three. “With an ever-growing population, it is only a question of time until we run into a serious overcrowding problem! We cannot waste empty buildings for anything else but living quarters for those who need them.”

4. “It pains my heart to see our community shrink so much,” sighs Brother @@RANDOMNAME@@. “I agree that we don’t need a house of worship on every corner nowadays, but let us at least keep some that remain. If we turn some of them into multi-faith community centers, we might even get some rows filled again.”

5. “Multi-faith community centers? Skate parks and blasphemers in our holy halls? Are you out of your minds?” screams religious fundamentalist @@RANDOMNAME@@. “You have left this country in the hands of the sinners for far too long! You have brought us upon the path of damnation, but it is not too late to repent! Make religious services mandatory and this problem will solve itself in less time than I need to describe the Creator’s glory.”

*6. “Just bulldoze ‘em all,” wheezes middle-aged construction worker @@RANDOMNAME@@ whilst coughing into a stained handkerchief. “Y’all are talking about repurposing buildings, whilst I see prime real estate being wasted. Tear ‘em down, sell the land, and build whatever the new developers want there.” [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*7. “Just bulldoze ‘em all,” wheezes middle-aged construction worker @@RANDOMNAME@@ whilst coughing into a stained handkerchief. “Y’all are talking about repurposing buildings, whilst I see valuable real estate being wasted. Tear ‘em down, nationalize the land, and build whatever the Ministry of Infrastructure wants there.” [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

The Issue
Dustin Wiseau, the young and charismatic Prime Minister of Brancaland, did not shake your hand at a recent meeting of world leaders. This caused considerable upset among many politicians at home. While the Brancalandian embassy insists that Wiseau simply didn’t see you, many @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ experts suggest that it was a political statement designed to undermine @@NAME@@ on the global stage.

The Debate
1. “How dare he?” fumes your irate Minister of Foreign Affairs, as @@HE@@ viciously tears apart photos of Mr. Wiseau. “I don’t give a damn about any of the hogwash Brancaland is releasing. There is no possible way he did not see you! It was a personal attack and he knows that offending you offends all of us. Demand an apology from Brancaland,” @@HE@@ pauses as a somewhat concerning grin spreads on @@HIS@@ face, “or else!”

2. “That Prime Minister is a charming young man,” coos your mostly-blind grandmother, while knitting you a too-small sweater. “Of course he couldn’t see you; the clothing you wear is far too easy to miss! Why not wear some more noticeable colors? You should, as leader, wear an outfit that matches the national flag! And over it, you could wear this beautiful sweater I just made you!” She beams at a security guard she mistakenly believes is you and hands the guard the sweater. “All yours, honey.”

3. “Everyone needs to relax,” murmurs @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Diplomatic Solutions, as @@HE@@ agrees to a draw in a chess match with your intern. “He may well have made a political statement, but instead of blowing your stack at Brancaland, why not sit down with Mr. Wiseau? After all, he may have had a bad day, considering his expression! Help him understand we aren’t enemies of Brancaland, and history will thank you. Angry responses never solved anything.”

4. “You aren’t addressing the real problem!” exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, your germophobe Health Minister, whose voice is muffled by a gas mask. “Handshakes are gross and unsanitary! You and Mr. Wiseau have thousands of germs on your hands, and all you’re doing is risking infectious diseases! Frankly, you should be thanking him for not passing his germs to you! You need to mandate proper hygienic practices - nothing ridiculous, just washing your hands very carefully every ten minutes - and make sure hand sanitizers and protective gloves are readily available.”

The Issue
The @@CAPITAL@@ @@ANIMALPLURAL@@, @@NAME@@’s publicly funded baseball team, have reached record levels of unpopularity. The team failed to reach the [i]Batter Up! Baseball[/i] League playoffs, and its players have fallen short of qualifying for international tournaments. What’s more, many @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ aren’t even wearing team hats. Financial advisors have expressed concern over the costs of maintaining the team and the stadium.

The Debate
1. “Give me a Z, give me a Z, give me a Z, this game puts me to sleep,” yawns @@@RANDOMNAME@@, a season ticket holder for the national chess league. “I’ll tell you why nobody cares about this team – it’s because baseball is boring. Who wants to sit around and watch a bunch of jocks smack a ball around with a stick? I say we disband the team and stop wasting the taxpayers’ money on sporting events. As the old saying goes, it’s better to support a sound mind than a men’s sauna... or something like that.”

2. “The problem isn’t sports; the problem is baseball itself!” exclaims avid ice hockey fan @@RANDOMNAME@@, proudly sporting a Brancalandian jersey. “I agree with nerdlinger here; baseball is boring. I’m sure if you invested in a more exciting sport, like the Brancalandian pastime of hockey, this wouldn’t be a problem. Hockey has everything – excitement, action, blood, sweat, and tears! All you need to do is switch up the sport and remodel the arena, and I guarantee you that hockey will bring all the fans to the yard, err, ice.”

3. “Don’t hate the game, hate the playing!” comments sleazy wrestling manager @@RANDOMNAME@@, whose bling is so shiny it temporarily blinds the hockey fan. “Why don’t you simply change the rules of the league to make it more exciting for the masses? Encourage fighting, throw in some [i]real[/i] @@ANIMALPLURAL@@ to chase the players, establish a proper gambling framework, and start up a steroid program to make sure they hit the ball with some serious power. The traditionalists might not like it, but nobody can deny the favor tokens that will be flowing in!”

[4]. “Or better yet, you could sell the team to the private sector,” suggests Rod Matei, CEO of gaming giant Funtendo. “It is obvious that you know nothing about how to manage a nation... I mean, a sports team. If you let us buy the @@ANIMALPLURAL@@, I promise you they will be the best team in all of @@REGION@@. All I ask in return is that you allow us to place advertisements in the stadium.” [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

5. The coach of the @ANIMALPLURAL@@ stands up and begins playing some inspirational music on his cell phone before addressing the team, who somehow all manage to fit in your office. “Listen up, team. We know that there’s a lot of naysayers out there who think that we’re a waste of money or don’t contribute anything to @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ society. You know what I say to that? What a load of sunflower seeds! I’ll tell you what this team has – we have heart, passion, and pride, something I say the rest of @@NAME@@ is lacking. Getting rid of our team spits in the face of our fans who’ve supported us since the beginning, and is an insult to our way of life. Now let’s go out there and win that game!”

The Issue
Ever since school uniforms were made compulsory, struggling parents have been complaining about the cost of clothing their kids. This fashion file has landed squarely on your desk.

The Debate
1. “This is outrageous and has to stop,” pants furious parent of quadruplets @@RANDOMNAME@@. “I have four boys, and you expect me to shell out a @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ every single year for these uniforms? I’m financially tied down as is! If schools and the government want kids to look a certain way, they can damn well pay the bill!”

2. “You want us to pay to put shirts on the backs of these money-grabbing... our dear children who are our nation’s future?” scoffs incredulous Principal @@RANDOMNAME@@. “Just get businesses to donate uniforms to those who can’t pay for them. In fact, my cousin who is on the Board of Directors at Rummikub Pizzas would probably be happy to help, so long as the company name and logo can be predominantly displayed.”

3. “If wee ones are havin’ trouble payin’ for their garb, then I’ll pay for it! All I ask is that they sport kilts instead!” pipes in eccentric United Federation billionaire @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ ‘Montgomery’ @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, affecting an accent that you are sure is not @@HIS@@ native one. “Och, when the wee lads and wee lasses wear wee kilts in school, ye’d be seeing proper traditional family values and pride surging. Just imagine all the little ‘uns dressed in the traditional tartan of the clans. It’d be a grand sight indeed, aye?”

4. “I’m not going to skirt around this issue - there should be no set guidelines for what kids should be able to wear!” declares @@RANDOMNAME@@, chairperson of the @@NAME@@ Poverty Advocacy Society. “You should not only end this ludicrous mandatory uniform policy, but you should also realise that setting any rules on what kids can wear is discriminatory! Some families can hardly invest in clothes of any kind! As long as the kids are in class, let them wear whatever they want to wear!”

[b][anchor=918]#918[/anchor]: J'Accuse! [Nation of Quebec; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Your Finance Minister is facing allegations of sexual misconduct from multiple women, everything from inappropriate comments to assault. Although he firmly denies the allegations, there have been calls from across the political spectrum for him to resign. He is the latest powerful figure implicated by the growing MeAsWell movement, which encourages victims to speak out against their abusers.

The Debate
1. “This is a witch hunt!” complains your Finance Minister, who now sits alone during lunchtime. “This is all hearsay and a political vendetta designed to take me down! Sure, I’ve had a little office flirtation and I may have told an inappropriate joke or two, but who hasn’t? This MeAsWell thing is getting ridiculous. Mere allegations have ruined so many careers. The government must stop these vindictive women spreading untested allegations publically, and punish their dishonesty when no conclusive proof is found.”

2 “I agree, old chap, and we must instill some of the traditional values that we’ve lost as a nation,” opines @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, an aging industrialist. “Whatever happened to the good old days when your secretary would smile if you smacked her bottom, accepting it as the accolade it is? These days I can’t even wink at my female employees without getting reported to human resources! Whatever happened to ‘boys will be boys’, eh?”

3. “Attitudes like that are exactly why women don’t come forward!” rebuffs @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, the founder of the MeAsWell movement. “The Finance Minister is a misogynist animal and needs to resign immediately. It’s morally reprehensible for you to have a sexual predator in your party, let alone your cabinet. In fact, there are probably many more creeps lurking in the halls of Parliament. If you are as moral as your party says you are, then you’ll root out and remove every single abuser from their position!”

*4. “Surely there’s some middle ground here?” asks your Minister of Compromises. “The Minister should get his due process. Have him take a discreet leave of absence and let the allegations play out in the courtroom. Our official statement is that we are a nation of innocent until proven guilty. If he’s guilty, then you can boot him out. If he’s innocent, we will welcome him back with open arms, standing proudly beside him on the evening news to say we knew he would be vindicated. See? That wasn’t so hard.” [[color=red]Must have courts[/color]]

*5. “Surely there’s some middle ground here?” asks your Minister of Compromises. “The Minister should get his due process. Have him take a discreet leave of absence and let the allegations play out in the courtroom. Our official statement is that we are a nation of innocent until proven guilty. If he’s guilty, then you can boot him out. If he’s innocent, we will welcome him back with open arms, standing proudly beside him on the evening news to say we knew he would be vindicated... What? No courts, you say? So build some. A man has the right to stand face to face with his accuser in front of a judge, a jury, and an execu... Wait, that’s a different plan. Just bring back courts and juries, and let this man defend himself. See? That wasn’t so hard.” [[color=blue]Must not have courts[/color]]

6. “Even if he’s found guilty, these baby steps won’t actually solve anything,” huffs one of the Finance Minister’s accusers @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@. “That pea-brained pig is just a symptom of a very large societal problem. Do you know how many times I get catcalled, just trying to live my daily life? It’s not a compliment! We need to tackle these things before they even start. We need to make sexual harassment training mandatory in every workplace. We also need to work in high schools, teaching young @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ to be aware that no-one deserves to be abused, ever.”

[b][anchor=919]#919[/anchor]: The Meaning of Life [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Ten years ago ice cream salesman @@RANDOMMALENAME@@ - better known as "the Murder Clown" - was sentenced to life in prison. He was convicted of having more than three dozen grisly circus-themed murders under his elasticated polka-dot belt, plus various acts of mayhem and the telling of criminally bad jokes. A week ago, his parole board decided that he was no longer a threat to society and could be released under strict conditions and with close surveillance. Yesterday, the press caught wind of this and launched a campaign protesting his release.

The Debate
1. "Life means life!" angrily proclaims Clark Wayne, a usually mild-mannered tabloid journalist. "Is there really any reason to allow this insane joker anything other than four concrete walls, plain food and stale water? You should remove any possibility of parole whenever a life sentence is assigned. Dangerous animals belong in cages!"

2. "It may have been a decade for him, but it feels like yesterday for those he hurt," whispers Francine Castle, whose husband and son were former victims of the criminal. "We can't feel safe until he is in the grave. You say he's a dangerous animal? Then put him down. Monsters like this belong in the electric chair, not in a cell."

3. "C'mon now, puddin', this is our job, making parole judgements! We know what we're doin'!" argues parole board leader Dr. Quinn, both hands clutching a mug of camomile tea defensively. "Ten years has gotta be plenty of time for Mistah Clown to be changin' his ways. You know people can change, right? Good guys can become bad, and bad ones can become good. Look, you can't undo the past; if we can get him rehabilitated and doin' some good for society, won't that be a good thing?"
