[b][anchor=1380]#1380[/anchor]: [color=#CE532A][i]MADness:[/i][/color] A View to a Thrill [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Story So Far
East Lebatuck's convoy confronted your naval blockade of San Vitenzo.

The Issue
The enemy ships refused to comply with your demands. A submarine bearing the red star of East Lebatuck brazenly torpedoed your lead warship, causing it to sink into the Gulf of Talkin. Your remaining blockade ships opened fire, destroying most of the convoy. Unfortunately, a cargo freighter was able to slip past the carnage and deliver more missiles and supplies to their operation on San Vitenzo.

The Debate
1. "This is an act of war!" yells Defense Minister Mack Rimera, throwing his notes across the room in a barely restrained fury. "Even worse, we only have a few days before they are able to launch. It's imperative that we send our air force to bomb the missile sites — and we must do it now!"

2. "Don't forget that we still have James Bont over there," reminds Intelligence Minister N, who had been whispering to a young woman in the corner. "My assistant, Ms. Evelyn Cashcent, tells me that Agent Bont has made significant progress at infiltrating the enemy bases. There's a good chance that he will be able to sabotage the missile launch equipment, if those are your orders. The only downside is that we don't know how long this might take."

3. "We shouldn't have let the situation devolve into armed conflict," states Minister of International Diplomacy Maureen Dusk, playing an anguished version of the '@@ANIMAL@@ Blues' on her guitar. "If there's any possibility of ending the violence, we have to pursue it. However, if we're going to have some sort of diplomatic summit to work out our differences, this is almost certainly our last opportunity. If we let it slip away... things could get rather grim."

[b][anchor=1381]#1381[/anchor]: [color=#CE532A][i]MADness:[/i][/color] Chairman No [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Story So Far
You have called for a meeting in an attempt to resolve "the missile situation" without resorting to violence.

The Issue
East Lebatuck and San Vitenzo have accepted your request for a diplomatic summit. After a brief flight, you have arrived in Granfalloon, the dusty and impoverished capital city of San Vitenzo. Several dignitaries are already waiting to speak with you.

The Debate
*1. "Ah, the capitalist pigs have arrived!" smirks East Lebatuckese Chairman Joseph Rushev, who was handing out hammer-and-sickle pins to the local residents. "The proud workers of San Vitenzo are tired of putting up with imperialist harassment. Stationing our nuclear weapons here liberates them from the threat of outside interference. With our support and protection, San Vitenzo can divert funding from their military to schools, roads, and other infrastructure. Now kindly remove yourselves from this island before you get into any trouble — and try to improve the welfare of your own downtrodden citizens before casting any more aspersions upon our brave comrades." [Legality TBD]

*2. "Ah, the capitalist pigs have arrived!" smirks East Lebatuckese Chairman Joseph Rushev, who was handing out hammer-and-sickle pins to the local residents. "The proud workers of San Vitenzo are tired of putting up with imperialist harassment. Stationing our nuclear weapons here liberates them from the threat of outside interference. With our support and protection, San Vitenzo can divert funding from their military to schools, roads, and other infrastructure. Now kindly remove yourselves from this island before you get into any trouble — and take your navy with you." [Legality TBD]

3. "Let's not start off on the wrong foot," calls out San Vitenzo's sandal-clad President for Life, "Doc" Moreno, as he walks up to you and pulls you aside. "The hard-working people of our nation need protection from the imperialists of the world who would take advantage of us... like you, perhaps. However, these nuclear missiles have just turned us into a target. What if you and Rushev were to each remove some of your weapons that were near the other party's borders? If your missiles in Smalltopia were to disappear, I think I could talk Rushev into removing all of his missiles from this island. Now... while you're here, have you ever heard of [i]boko-maru[/i]?" He looks at your feet and removes a tape measure from his pocket.

4. As you are about to return to your hotel room, a young woman approaches you and starts speaking rapidly. "Excuse me! My name is Ramona Moreno — President Moreno is my father. Papa is too proud to admit it, but our people are starving. Since he'll never ask for it directly, I will: we need massive amounts of food and medical aid. The East Lebatuckese don't care about our people; they're just exploiting us for our resources and taking advantage of our location in case they need to launch missiles at @@NAME@@. Without your assistance, we'll quickly end up as another impoverished, powerless satellite state within East Lebatuck's Socialist Pact. Please negotiate a missile removal plan with my father — and then send us as much aid as you can afford."

[b][anchor=1382]#1382[/anchor]: [color=#CE532A][i]MADness:[/i][/color] Leave and Let Die [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Story So Far
You are currently participating in a diplomatic summit on San Vitenzo.

The Issue
During today's negotiations, you told the enemy that it was acceptable to station nuclear weapons near your borders. Your shocked advisors have confronted you to get clarification about that particular stance.

The Debate
1. "You were just bluffing, right?" questions Defense Minister Mack Rimera, who looks like he's on the verge of a panic attack. "We can't have enemy nukes within range of our people! Our bombers are fueled and ready for takeoff as we speak. Just give the word, and this whole problem will be destroyed in a violent inferno — the only option that truly brings closure to this mess."

2. "I get it... you were only stalling so that Bont would have more time to sabotage the missile installations," surmises Intelligence Minister N with a look of dawning comprehension. "That is what you were doing, correct? We are in a position to eliminate the enemy's first strike capabilities. Let's seize the opportunity!"

3. "I thought we agreed to not meddle in other countries' business?" admonishes Minister of International Diplomacy Maureen Dusk, thrashing out an improvised version of 'Paint It Violet' on her guitar. "Send James Bont home, and let's get out of here. Who cares if they have nuclear weapons? Maybe if we started minding our own business and working to make @@NAME@@ a better place instead of spending so much on the military, they wouldn't feel so threatened by us."

[b][anchor=1383]#1383[/anchor]: [color=#CE532A][i]MADness:[/i][/color] You Only Negotiate Twice [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Story So Far
You agreed to remove your missiles from Smalltopia in exchange for East Lebatuck removing their missiles from San Vitenzo.

The Issue
After a series of secret negotiations, everyone has shaken hands and made a commitment to disarm. You and an aide have met with Chairman Joseph Rushev in a beautiful glass-fronted conference room in San Vitenzo to sign the final agreement.

The Debate
*1. "Good morning! Are you ready to make history? Let me just get my ceremonial signing pen." Rushev reaches into his coat pocket and removes not a pen, but a Maxarov pistol, which he points directly at your chest. "Have you noticed that world leaders like ourselves never get frisked for weapons? I can't remember the last time I had to go through a metal detector. Seems like a security flaw, don't you think? Well, I digress. I hope you didn't actually expect me to remove my own missiles. You see, I didn't get to be Chairman of East Lebatuck by giving up power every time I had a disagreement with someone. Real leaders do whatever it takes to seize power and claw our way to the top. Of course, I hope you understand that this isn't personal — it's just politics. As soon as you're dead..." Suddenly, the window shatters as James Bont crashes into the room in a hail of glass fragments, closely followed by his @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ flag parachute. Bont quickly fires a miniature grappling hook from his wristwatch, which latches onto Rushev's pistol and pulls it out of his hand. "I hope you don't mind me dropping in, boss. Your aide pressed the panic button — and I see that mister Commie in Chief is up to his old tricks. Well, here's how it's going to go, Rushev. I secretly removed a warhead from one of your nuclear missiles and handed it off to one of my colleagues in East Lebatuck. He has hidden it in your capital city, ready for detonation at a moment's notice. Either you sign that agreement and follow through with each of its terms, or your 'glorious worker's paradise' is going to be a victim of your own hubris. Are we clear?" Rushev nods and quickly scribbles his name on the agreement. "Good. Now get out of here and don't threaten @@NAME@@ ever again, or your capital will become a radioactive crater faster than you can say 'Marxist class struggle'." Bont turns toward you as Rushev and his aide scurry out of the room. "Let's go home, shall we?"

Now get out of here and don't threaten @@NAME@@ ever again, or your capital will become a radioactive crater faster than you can say 'Marxist class struggle'."

[b][anchor=1384]#1384[/anchor]: [color=#CE532A][i]MADness:[/i][/color] On @@LEADER@@'s Secret Service [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Story So Far
You have asked James Bont to sabotage East Lebatuck's missile installation project on San Vitenzo.

The Issue
You and your advisors are gathered around the table in a secure meeting room to hear the latest updates from your secret agent, whose static-distorted voice is currently emanating from a phone in the center of the table.

The Debate
1. "Good morning. I regret to inform you that I will require some assistance," declares Bont, who doesn't betray any sense of emotion. "The nuclear missiles on this island are currently being housed in secure warehouses at East Lebatuck's military bases. The problem is that each warehouse is surrounded by a battalion of elite troops from their Red Guard. No one gets in or out without the top general's explicit approval. I need someone in HQ to hack into the enemy's personnel files and make it look like I'm a missile technician who was sent by Chairman Rushev to check on their progress. Can you make it happen?"

2. "This obviously isn't working," states Defense Minister Mack Rimera, twitching nervously as he continues to gulp coffee from an oversize mug. "The enemy is going to see right through that plan. Remember the time Bont tried to pass as a Macronesian Islander? What a debacle. The easy way to solve this problem is with a good, old-fashioned bombing. We can target the missile warehouses — at least the ones we know about — and keep civilian casualties to a minimum. Two hundred deaths is fairly low, right?"

--------------------------------------------------------------
[b][anchor=1385]#1385[/anchor]: [color=#CE532A][i]MADness:[/i][/color] Skycrash [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Story So Far
You sent bombers to attack East Lebatuck's missile sites.

The Issue
Your brave pilots made a valiant effort to take out the missile installations on San Vitenzo. Unfortunately, the enemy was prepared for this scenario. The @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ bombers were harassed by enemy anti-aircraft fire from the moment they entered San Vitenzan airspace. Your military analysts are now reporting that one of the aircraft has been shot down, and the pilot was captured.

The Debate
1. "What a disaster!" shouts Defense Minister Mack Rimera, now drinking directly from his unmarked flask. "Not only were our bombers unable to complete their mission, but they're probably torturing that pilot as we speak! At least he reportedly put up a good fight before they were able to capture him. Well, screw it. We're out of options. We must launch a full invasion of San Vitenzo."

2. "Do you always let your... pistol do your thinking for you?" replies Maureen Dusk, whose guitar is uncharacteristically silent. "What if we were to offer a prisoner swap? We still have that East Lebatuckese spy we found wandering in the shopping district of @@CAPITAL@@ a while back. He didn't seem to know much about anything, so it wouldn't be a great loss. Let's offer to trade him for our pilot. If we act fast enough, they might not be able to extract any classified military secrets."

3. Before anyone else can speak, your rarely seen Minister of Mass Destruction, Dr. Helix Fenniker, climbs down a rope ladder that has just descended from the ceiling. "I couldn't help overhearing that we have a belligerent enemy and a captured pilot. Allow me to introduce 'ICE-X' — my lab's solution to both of those problems. This breakthrough bio-weapon destroys cell walls via a rapid crystallization process. Deployment is easy — we've already loaded the canisters into some modified cruise missiles. Our warships can fire them at the enemy bases with impunity! Of course, any 'innocent' civilians or animals that are exposed to the residue will experience catastrophic organ failure. But look on the bright side! Our pilot won't be able to divulge any secrets, and most of the enemy troops will be eliminated!"

The Story So Far
Your secret agent has been sent to infiltrate the enemy's missile storage sites.

The Issue
The nation's top government officials have been anxiously waiting to hear the outcome of James Bont's secret mission. As you are gathered around a table with your advisors to discuss the situation, Intelligence Minister N suddenly motions for silence and removes a buzzing phone from a nearby briefcase. "That's Bont's emergency contact number. I'm putting it on speakerphone." N places the phone in the middle of the table. "Hello, @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ swine! This is Chairman Joseph Rushev of East Lebatuck. You were expecting to hear from Mr. Bont, I presume? We caught your spy snooping around one of our military bases in San Vitenzo, claiming to have been sent by me! What kind of fools do you take us for? I think it's time that we taught you a lesson. Perhaps if I sent you Mr. Bont's severed head in a box, you would finally get the message that East Lebatuck does not tolerate espionage or foreign meddling!" You hear a click, and the line goes dead.

The Debate
1. "What the hell was that?" Defense Minister Mack Rimera takes a long swig from his flask before continuing. "Well, I hate to say 'I told you so,' but I knew from the beginning that this spy nonsense wasn't going to work. Swift and decisive military action directed at those bases is our only remaining option. We need to prepare for a full invasion — land, sea, and air!"

2. "Do you always let your... pistol do your thinking for you?" replies Maureen Dusk, whose guitar is uncharacteristically silent. "What if we were to offer a prisoner swap? We still have that East Lebatuckese spy that we captured a while back — and we already got all of the information we needed out of him. Let's offer to trade him for our agent. If we act fast enough, they might not be able to extract any classified secrets — or his head."

3. Before anyone else can speak, your rarely seen Minister of Mass Destruction, Dr. Helix Fenniker, climbs down a rope ladder that has just descended from the ceiling. "I couldn't help overhearing that we have a belligerent enemy and a captured agent. Allow me to introduce 'ICE-X' — my lab's solution to both of those problems.

But look on the bright side! Most of the enemy troops will be eliminated. Furthermore, I'm sure Bont will escape in time like he always does — and if he doesn't make it, he won't be able to divulge any secrets!"

The Story So Far
Your government offered to trade prisoners with East Lebatuck.

The Issue
Good news, everyone! East Lebatuck has accepted your offer for a prisoner swap — on the condition that you deliver their agent to the meeting place in person, alone and unarmed.

The Debate

1. You have arrived at the agreed-upon location, a bridge that spans the border between Smalltopia and East Lebatuck. Their spy, who is still wearing handcuffs and a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ prison uniform, dutifully shuffles alongside you as you exit your car. The night air seems colder than usual for this time of year. After a few minutes, an armored personnel carrier drives over from the other side of the bridge, with lackeys in suits running alongside the vehicle. A phalanx of bodyguards armed with automatic rifles jump out of the vehicle and point their weapons at you as East Lebatuck Chairman Joseph Rushev steps out of the back. He pulls a disheveled figure out of the vehicle and pushes him toward you as your own prisoner starts walking toward his people. "Come here, Comrade Adel. The imperialists can't hurt you anymore," smirks Rushev, who turns to face you. "So, I must ask... how stupid are you? Now I get to swap a useless prisoner for the leader of @@NAME@@! How much money do you think your government is willing to pay to get you back?" Without warning, the guard furthest to the right suddenly pivots and unleashes a barrage of bullets into the other guards, who are cut down before they realize what is happening. The rogue shooter removes his helmet, revealing the handsome face of James Bont. Your secret agent runs over to your position, keeping his rifle pointed at Chairman Rushev, and pulls out a phone. After dialing a number, he listens intently for a moment before a loud burst of static disrupts the silence. "Looks like your plans are shot, comrade!" announces Bont, mockingly. "I've just detonated all of the hidden explosives that I planted on your missiles on San Vitenzo. Consider yourself impotent! I suggest you head on home, or the next bullet that comes out of this gun is going to get a little Red." Bont turns toward you as Chairman Rushev jumps back into his vehicle and slinks away towards the other side of the bridge. "Let's go home, shall we?"

The Story So Far
You have ordered an attack on East Lebatuck's military bases in San Vitenzo.

The Issue
The enemy's soldiers have suffered overwhelming casualties, thanks to your advanced military technology. Unfortunately, East Lebatuck seems to have interpreted your actions as an unforgivable assault upon their nation and its allies. Moments ago, all of the nuclear missiles on San Vitenzo were launched and appear to be headed at targets throughout @@NAME@@.

The Debate
1. "HOLY VIOLET! GET TO THE BUNKER! RUN!" A flood of screaming people push you downstairs and through a long hallway, stumbling into the fallout shelter beneath your office. The door clanks shut as the last staff members sprint through the reinforced threshold. Your defense minister shambles over towards you, head in hands. "Well, we're screwed. @@CAPITAL@@ is finished. I'm not even sure this bunker can withstand a direct hit. On the bright side, our own nuclear missiles are ready for launch. Which of East Lebatuck's cities do you hate the most?" A nervous guffaw escapes from his lips.

2. "No... we can't do that to the poor folks," murmurs Maureen Dusk, devoid of guitar, her voice barely above a whisper. "East Lebatuck is filled with people like us. The oppressed, freedom-loving consumers won't ever have a chance to rise up and overthrow the communist government if we wipe them from existence. Don't retaliate, @@LEADER@@. The violence has to stop somewhere. By the way, it was an honor serving with you." A single teardrop runs down her face.

The Story So Far
You and your staff are huddled into an underground bunker, waiting for the end to come.

The Issue
The minutes pass in relative silence. Occasionally, the stillness is punctuated by a sniffle or a whimper that seems amplified in the confined space. A few distant rumbles can be heard, but nothing that sounds like the expected obliteration of everyone's hopes and dreams. Suddenly, Defense Minister Mack Rimera's voice cuts through the rising tide of whispered conversations: "What the hell? Chief, we've got an incoming call."

The Debate

[1]. Rimera steps away from the control panel where he was entering the coordinates for targeted enemy cities and ushers you over to a nearby phone, where a red light is blinking. He presses a few buttons to put the call on speakerphone. "@@LEADER@@? Is that you?" The static-obscured voice of James Bont is barely audible, causing Rimera to frantically increase the volume. "I was able to infiltrate the enemy's bases by posing as a technician. The whole operation here is being run by a rather boorish fellow by the name of General Stuppa. As the diplomatic conflict intensified, Stuppa was constantly arguing with Colonel Sinwat, his second in command. General Stuppa kept shouting that @@NAME@@ was a threat that needed to be taken out preemptively. Even after some sort of attack by our military, Colonel Sinwat wouldn't support any retaliation that would lead to mutually assured destruction. General Stuppa accused his officer of treason, pulled out his sidearm, and shot him in the head, then took his nuclear launch key. Stuppa and the remaining officers immediately launched all of the ballistic missiles straight at @@NAME@@. Fortunately... I had already disarmed each of the warheads." Bont's closing words are obscured by a deafening cheer from the people surrounding you.

The Story So Far
The enemy's nuclear weapons failed to detonate due to the courageous actions of your secret agent.

The Issue
Although East Lebatuck remains angry with you due to recent events, they have insisted that they did not intend for things to escalate this far. As an apology for this sobering occurrence, their contrite government has arranged peace talks in an attempt to defuse the situation.

The Debate
*1. "I'd like to personally apologize for the... um... missile incident," admits Chairman Joseph Rushev of East Lebatuck, looking more sheepish than you have ever seen him. "General Stuppa was definitely not authorized to initiate a nuclear strike or take any action that would result in our mutually assured destruction. He and his officers have been relieved of duty... permanently. As a token of our goodwill, your pilot who was shot down and your agent who managed to infiltrate our military bases will be returned to @@NAME@@ unharmed. If you are willing to sign a non-aggression treaty and pay reparations for the brave warriors of communism who were needlessly killed, I think we can put this whole unpleasant situation behind us. What do you say?"

*2. "I'd like to personally apologize for the... um... missile incident," admits Chairman Joseph Rushev of East Lebatuck, looking more sheepish than you have ever seen him.

If you are willing to sign a non-aggression treaty and pay reparations for the brave warriors of communism who were needlessly killed, I think we can put this whole unpleasant situation behind us. What do you say?"

3. "Sure, go ahead and sign their treaty, but it's not enough," sighs Maureen Dusk, who is softly playing 'Sweet Home @@CAPITAL@@' on her guitar. "This incident clearly proves that weapons of mass destruction can no longer be allowed to exist. I spoke with my counterpart in East Lebatuck, and it appears that they are also willing to disarm if we do the same. It's a bold move, but I think you're the sort of brave visionary who can lead us into a new era of peace, free from the scourge of WMDs."

**4. "You've practically destroyed our island!" weeps President "Doc" Moreno of San Vitenzo, who is incongruously wearing a suit jacket and tie with shorts and sandals. How are my people supposed to 'put this situation behind us' when you've bombed their houses and crops into oblivion? Even Almighty Bokonon won't be able to undo this calamity. After you sign whatever treaty East Lebatuck is offering, you must allow our people to settle in @@NAME@@... and give us a little cash to ease our troubles. Isn't that what neighbors do for one another?"

"Have you forgotten how they almost annihilated us? Yes, we would have done the same thing to them if it weren't for that phone call from our secret agent — and we definitely killed a bunch of their soldiers. What did they think would happen when they brought nuclear missiles to our borders? This treaty is just a slap in the face — and we're definitely not disarming or letting in waves of immigrants. You need to walk away from the negotiating table, and hit them with sanctions for good measure. They're our enemy forevermore."

The Story So Far
A few months have passed since the G20,000 Summit, where you agreed to station some of your nuclear weapons in San Vitenzo to aid in their defense against the forces of capitalist imperialism.

The Issue
Today was supposed to be a calm day. The issues on your desk this morning were even more trivial than usual. Of course, that's how it always goes. Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich suddenly bursts into your office, closely followed by two other ministers who are engaged in a spirited debate. Malinovich quickly marches over to your desk and motions for the others to be silent. "Good morning, Comrade Leader. As per our agreement with San Vitenzo, we are in the process of installing a nuclear missile shield as a bulwark against the United Federation's aggressions. Unfortunately, the capitalist pigs have spotted the missiles and are now demanding that we remove them."

The Debate
1. Malinovich hands you a transcribed copy of the enemy's demands before continuing. "You know as well as I do that the United Federation's leadership are a bunch of spineless weasels who will back down when confronted with a superior fighting force like our own. Tell them to quit interfering, or face our wrath."

2. "There's no need to provoke them unnecessarily," replies Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, who is tuning the guitar that she is infamous for carrying around at all times. "What if we were to propose some sort of negotiation between our government, the United Federation, and San Vitenzo? We don't have to actually agree on anything; we just want to delay them long enough to install the missiles before the imperialists realize what's really going on!"

3. "Maybe we should offer a metaphorical carrot instead of a stick?" suggests Warwick Wampeter, one of your Co-Ministers of Totally Legal and Creative Solutions. "I've heard that the United Federation's leader, President Ken J. Finnedy, is worried about his main opponent in their upcoming elections. If we were to discover some embarrassing revelations about this other candidate, and then offer the evidence to Finnedy, I think he would be more willing to turn a blind eye. Of course, all of this quid pro quo will require a few quid — as they say in Albionia — to help us find the most useful information."

The Story So Far
The United Federation is challenging your right to place missiles on an island nation that is near their borders.

The Issue
After your other advisors have gathered their "world's best apparatchik" mugs and left the room, your Minister of Intelligence, known only as "N", approaches you to take advantage of the opportunity for a private conversation.

The Debate
1. "If you have a few spare minutes, Comrade Leader, I'd like to remind you that we have a secret agent in the United Federation. Natasha Milanova is highly skilled in the delicate arts of infiltration, espionage, and making people disappear without a trace. She's currently operating under the alias of 'Charlotte Johnson', a low-level officer at the Libertyville naval base. If you'd like, we can instruct her to focus on intercepting classified information on ship deployments and troop movements, and send us all of the details."

2. N pauses, picks up a briefcase labeled 'In Case of Emergency', and tips it towards an unused mug, dispensing an ample measure of steaming-hot tea. "Ah, that's much better than that awful People's EqualiTea they serve in the cafeteria. Anyway, we also have the option of ordering Agent Milanova to directly sabotage the enemy's naval operations. The downside of this is that she's much more likely to be caught compared to a simple intelligence-gathering operation — and we have very few agents in the United Federation, so she's much more valuable than those other incompetent zasranets that work for us. Of course, if things get out of hand and the imperialists try to invade San Vitenzo, they're going to have a much more difficult time if their ships were to suddenly become coral reef habitats at the bottom of their harbor. So, which is it going to be?"

The Story So Far
The United Federation has asked you to remove your nuclear missiles from San Vitenzo — but they'll have to use more than words to stop @@NAME@@.

The Issue
The United Federation is not backing down. The people of San Vitenzo — and your troops stationed there — have woken up to find that their island is surrounded by a naval blockade.

The Debate
1. "Well, well, well! It looks like those weasels found their courage," exclaims Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich, who is pouring something from a flask into his morning coffee. "Our supply ships with the remaining missiles and soldiers won't be able to get through without a little bit of violence — but maybe that's what we need right now. When our convoy approaches the blockade line, order the destroyers to open fire and clear a path through the enemy ships."

2. "We can't escalate the situation!" shouts Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, playing an anguished version of the '@@ANIMAL@@ Blues' on her guitar. "San Vitenzo may be our ally, but we won't benefit from getting into a shooting war over a small island with minimal resources. Have our ships perform maneuvers for a day or two to confuse the enemy, then order them to turn around. That should still be enough of a delay for our troops on the island to make some progress installing the first shipment of missiles."

The Story So Far
The vile capitalists of the United Federation attempted to blockade the ports of San Vitenzo to prevent your supply ships from getting through.

The Issue
Success! Your heroic sailors managed to sink several enemy ships that were surrounding San Vitenzo, allowing your navy to deliver the remaining missiles and supplies that were needed for their protection. As you are heading toward a meeting to discuss your next steps, you receive a phone call from N, your Minister of Intelligence, who has news from Natasha Milanova and needs to speak with you about her mission.

The Debate
1. "Good morning, boss," proclaims the steady voice of your spy chief. "Milanova reported that she was able to steal an officer's uniform and security badge that should allow her to enter the high security areas of their naval base. However, there's been a small... complication. We believe that one or more enemy agents are aware of her presence. They're probably too dangerous to ignore. Do you want to give Milanova a free hand to neutralize the threat? A few bullets should take care of... wait, did you hear that clicking sound? I hope this phone isn't bugged. Code Blue, Hermann von Pückler-Muskau." N hangs up, leaving you bewildered.

2. After staring at your phone for a few seconds, you feel your right shoe vibrating as blue text starts scrolling across the toe: "Alternatively, if you're uncomfortable with extrajudicial killings, you could order Milanova to capture any enemy spies and hand them off to us for interrogation. It's riskier than just shooting them — our enemies may have set up a trap that could result in Milanova's death — but we might be able to gain valuable intel or use prisoners as a negotiating tool."

3. While still thinking it over, you're suddenly interrupted by cooing coming from an open window. A carrier pigeon alights on your shoulder and presents a small note tied to its right leg: "There's a third way of dealing with this. If you want, you could instruct Milanova to simply ignore the enemy agents and focus on her primary mission. This might just be a diversion to waste our time. Well, let me know of your decision by this evening. PS: This message will self-destruct in ten seconds."

The Story So Far
The vile capitalists of the United Federation attempted to blockade the ports of San Vitenzo to prevent your supply ships from getting through.

Instead of sending the imperialist navy to a watery grave, you bravely decided to de-escalate the situation by ordering your navy to turn around.

The Story So Far
You have given instructions to your secret agent and responded to the United Federation's naval blockade of your ally.

The Issue
Just when you appeared to be in control of the situation, you have received word that the capitalist running-dog lackeys attempted to bomb your missile sites in San Vitenzo. Fortunately, your troops on the ground were able to shoot down one of the bombers, and then apprehended the pilot as he attempted to flee.

The Debate
1. "The enemy pilot thought that he would be able to hide in the forests of San Vitenzo," smirks Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich. "Our scouts easily spotted the parachute and tracked him down. Comrade Leader, I think we need to send a message to the United Federation by publicly executing their pilot. No one attacks us without swift and violent retribution!"

2. "But that would be throwing away a potential gold mine of information," sputters Intelligence Minister N. "This pilot has got to know all sorts of military secrets. Let my people try to extract them. I'm sure the San Vitenzans will let us borrow that hook they use for disemboweling criminals."

3. "It pains me to say this, but the enemy pilot deserves a fair trial and humane treatment," admits Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, casually strumming a half-tempo version of '@@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Rhapsody' on her guitar. "He's obviously guilty of aggressions against the Card Slave. However, we can't sink to the enemy's level. We must form a military tribunal to allow him to try to explain his actions."

The Story So Far
Secret agent Natasha Milanova is on assignment at the United Federation's Libertyville naval base.

The Issue
You and your advisors are gathered around the table in a secure meeting room to hear the latest updates from your secret agent, whose static-distorted voice is currently emanating from a phone in the center of the table.

The Debate
*1. "Good morning. I regret to inform you that I will require some assistance," declares Milanova, who doesn't betray any sense of emotion. "During my investigations, I overheard a naval officer by the name of Captain Duffle who was planning some type of 'counter-attack' on @@NAME@@. I didn't hear many of the details, but I think something big is being planned at base headquarters. The problem is that it is constantly guarded by a battalion of elite troops from the United Federation's Violet Berets. No one gets in or out without the top admiral's explicit approval. I need someone in HQ to hack into the enemy's personnel files and make it look like I'm an auditor who was sent by President Finnedy to perform a surprise inspection. Can you make it happen?" [color=purple]Option 1 of Issue 1392 was previously selected[/color]

3. "That's not going to work," asserts Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich, twitching nervously as he continues to gulp coffee from an oversize mug. "The enemy is going to see right through that plan. Remember the time Milanova tried to pass as a Sakuran counter-terrorism operative? What a debacle. If she's captured, we'll be completely cut off from our only source of information about the Federation's military deployments. I think Milanova should just keep her ear to the ground and try to uncover more of this plan without assuming any unnecessary risks."

The Story So Far
You recently captured an enemy pilot who was attempting to bomb your missile sites on San Vitenzo. Justice was swift.

The Issue
Tensions with the United Federation have never been higher. After the unpleasant incident with their downed pilot, they are now threatening to invade San Vitenzo and destroy all of your military installations.

The Debate
1. "We can't back down now, Comrade Leader," declares Defense Minister Rolan Malinovich while furiously writing notes on a structural diagram of the nation's missile silos. "Although we don't have many troops on the ground, some of the local villagers have been trained in guerilla warfare by their government. It wouldn't be difficult to airdrop weapons and supplies. Let us fight alongside our comrades in a glorious struggle against the hated imperialists!"

2. "Are we sure that San Vitenzo is a worthy ally?" questions Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, who had been plucking a few notes of 'Born in @@NAME@@' on her guitar. "I heard a rumor that they're actually considering... market-based economic reforms." She shudders uncontrollably. "It would be a mistake to ask our brave soldiers to die in battle defending a faraway nation that might not be fully committed to the anti-capitalist struggle. Tell the United Federation that we're willing to negotiate."

[b][anchor=1399]#1399[/anchor]: [color=#CE532A][i]MADness:[/i][/color] VioletEye [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Story So Far
You chose to arm the San Vitenzan peasants to help your outnumbered troops fend off an invasion.

The Issue
The United Federation's military has invaded San Vitenzo in an attempt to find and destroy all of your nuclear missiles that are stationed on the island. Due to your over-reliance on poorly trained local militias, you and your allies are losing. Badly.

The Debate
1. "We're overextended," declares Minister of International Diplomacy Andrea Gramyki, playing a few tentative strains of 'Comrade Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' on her guitar. "We really shouldn't have let ourselves get involved in a conflict on the other side of the world — not without sending a lot more of our own troops and equipment over there, which the United Federation would have discovered even earlier. A few hundred guards, missile technicians, and advisors wasn't going to cut it. Offer a cease-fire and say that we are willing to negotiate."

2. Before anyone else can speak, your rarely seen Minister of Mass Destruction, Dr. Helix Fenniker, climbs down a rope ladder that has just descended from the ceiling. "I couldn't help overhearing that we have a belligerent enemy to deal with, but few of our own troops on the ground. Allow me to introduce 'VioletEye' — the solution to your problems! My lab has developed and launched an orbital missile platform that can strike any target on the planet with conventional, high-yield explosives. But wait — there's more! The missiles travel at such a high speed that they're difficult to intercept without specialized equipment. The VioletEye satellite is only a prototype, but this seems like the perfect opportunity to test it, don't you think? Just be aware that if we use this weapon, it will take months to load it with new missiles."

3. "Wow, missiles that can strike our enemies from space? Let's do that!" exclaims Crazy Boris, your only spy who is expressly prohibited from carrying exploding pens due to an unpleasant incident at a fireworks factory. "But we also need a distraction so that the United Federation doesn't detect the missiles until it's too late to avoid them. Loco Lopez, an old friend of mine in Manamana, tells me that he has successfully completed his rabbit weaponization program and is willing to let us test it. Just strap a tiny parachute on each of these frightening fuzz-balls, air-drop them on the enemy, and watch the havoc ensue!"
