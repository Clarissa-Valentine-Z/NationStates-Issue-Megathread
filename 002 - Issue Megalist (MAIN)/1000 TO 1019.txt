[b][anchor=1000]#1000[/anchor]: Should Democracy Be Compulsory?[/b]

The Issue
With an election looming, certain sections of the online media have stirred up the debate over voluntary vs compulsory voting.

The Debate
1. "Compulsory voting makes about as much sense as a death penalty for attempted suicide," says popular social media identity @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ in a promoted tweet. "You can't force people to be free! You can only give them the choice. Besides, if all the people out there who don't understand Bigtopia is our most trusted friend and ally went to the polls, what would happen? I shudder to think."

2. @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME_1@@ actually makes a great and under-rated point," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in a post with no geo-tag. "We really don't want to encourage everyday people to vote. They don't understand the important issues, like how it's perfectly fine that a sudden rash of pro-Bigtopia candidates are running for office, because Bigtopia is our most trusted friend and ally."

3. "This raises an interesting issue," says @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, your brother. "And that is: Why are you being such a hardass on Bigtopia? They're our most trusted friend and ally. I was there last month on a generously funded study tour and they assured me there's absolutely no covert plan to subvert and control the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ political process. So why worry about which candidate supposedly has connections to which foreign nation, when Bigtopia is our most trusted friend and ally?"

4. "I think we have to acknowledge that there is a well-advanced Bigtopian plan to seed our election with candidates," says trusted adviser @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in hushed tones, once the war room has been sealed and swept for listening devices. "It may be more subtle than a military attack, but ultimately the aim is the same. To protect the integrity of this government, we should disqualify all candidates who we discover to hold ties to a foreign power, however slight."

5. "The threat is real, but consider the implications of such a response," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who joined your office after fleeing persecution in @@HIS@@ native Maxtopia. "No candidates with foreign families or experience in other nations... we'd be restricting office to a protected minority, with the government deciding who can run. That doesn't sound particularly democratic. We should require full disclosure of personal finances and foreign connections, but ultimately let the voters decide. I hope the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ people can see through this misinformation assault, if only we give them the chance."

The Issue
The nation is in uproar after a star football player was released from prison after spending six years behind bars for sexual assault, following new revelations that his disputant fabricated the entire incident. Leading lawyers, including your own, have asked you to take a stand against false accusations.

The Debate
1. "It's a disgrace that all it takes to destroy a person's life is one false allegation," protests sleazy lawyer @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, who is facing multiple sexual harassment claims. "The problem is that we're so quick to believe these so-called 'victims' instead of the accused. Force them to undergo rigorous interviews and get the coppers to perform DNA tests. This will deter people from making mendacious accusations in the first place. Anyone who is found out must be jailed for the same amount of time that their so-called attacker would have been sentenced to."

2. "How can you have no sympathy for the injured party?" inquires @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the most feared prosecutor in @@NAME@@, as the men in the room all fall silent. "We absolutely should believe the victims. The harder you make it for them to come forward, the more you'll encourage the criminals to keep doing what they're doing. While it is unfortunate that sometimes inculpable people get caught up in the courts, it's better to imprison a thousand innocent men than to let one rapist go free."

3. "You know, all this talk about false allegations has gotten me worried," whispers your personal lawyer @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, as he purposely spills coffee on his crotch, then gets your young secretary to help him dry it off. "It won't be long until one of your pesky critics accuses you of a crime to ruin your career. I say we should nip that in the bud. Quietly pass a law that protects you, your cabinet, and your lawyer from any sort of legal ramifications. You rule this country. It's only fair that you are bound by none of its laws."

4. "ORDER! ORDER! Nobody has heard from me yet!" exclaims notoriously corrupt Judge @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while banging a gavel on your desk. "Quite frankly I don't care who is accused or who accuses them. I think we all know what makes our justice system go around - @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@. Sentencing should be based on how much both sides are able to pay up. Sure, the poor might not be able to win in this system, but hey, that's the way the caviar crumbles!"

[b][anchor=1002]#1002[/anchor]: The Call of Nature [Frieden-und Freudenland; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
@@NAME@@ has become the laughing stock of the world after The Smalltopian Sentinel published an article on the public urination problem in @@CAPITAL@@. This article cited the Smalltopian ambassador, who complained about the sordid stench outside the embassy building. Distraught at the international humiliation, your aides have come to you with a shower of suggestions.

The Debate
1. "They're calling us the latrine of @@REGION@@!" yells @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Foreign Affairs, holding a violet-scented wet wipe to @@HIS@@ nose. "The worst thing is that those despicable Smalltopian tabloids aren't even wrong: our people are marking their territory on every building wall, and there's a golden river running alongside every city street. We need to institute punitive fines to deter public urination before our good reputation gets flushed down the toilet!"

*2. "Aren't we... hic... aren't we being a little... too uh... harsh here?" slurs Yuri Nator, a perpetually drunk civil servant, struggling with his zipper before finally giving up. "I mean, if I am taking a walk with my buddies after a guys' night out and my beer wants to... get out of my body, who can stop me from... shaking hands with an old friend? Besides, I betcha holding it in must be bad for your urine bladder or something. We should be allowed to let it all go whenever and wherever we want!" A look of relief crosses his face, as your office carpet gains a wet patch. [[color=blue]alcohol is legal[/color]]

*3. "Aren't we... hic... aren't we being a little... too uh... harsh here?" slurs Yuri Nator, a civil servant who you suspect may be breaking the laws against alcohol consumption, as he struggles with his zipper before finally giving up. "I mean, if I am taking a walk with my buddies after a guys' night out and I've had too much... uh... barley water... then who can stop me from... shaking hands with an old friend? Besides, I betcha holding it in must be bad for your urine bladder or something. We should be allowed to let it all go whenever and wherever we want!" A look of relief crosses his face, as your office carpet gains a wet patch. [[color=red]alcohol is illegal[/color]]

4. "Hmm, I sniff a golden opportunity here!" exclaims Lizbeth Ardenne, your Minister of Aerosol Solutions and a part-time perfume producer. "It seems people are mainly disturbed by the all-pervasive smell of urine in @@CAPITAL@@, but this could easily be remedied if we deodorized our streets! All we need to do is to install spray tanks filled with my signature fragrance Elizabeth No.5 on all garbage trucks, and they could just besprinkle the whole city with it while driving around in @@CAPITAL@@. I assure you, our sweet-scented city will be the envy of @@REGION@@!"

5. "This damn situation stinks to hell," growls General Sam L. Jackson, slamming a knife point-first into a world map on your desk, skewering Smalltopia. "We can't allow ourselves to be insulted by a goddamn pipsqueak nation like Smalltopia. I suggest we gather up the run-off from our city streets, and have our bombers dump the effluent over Smalltopia's cities. And we shall rain down upon them with great vengeance and furious anger..."

[b][anchor=1003]#1003[/anchor]: That Smarts [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The clever boffins down in Human Resources have been experimenting with the cloning vats, and have realised that by tweaking DNA they can alter cognitive neurotransmitter levels, and create babies that are significantly more or less intelligent than the average.

The Debate
1. "Oh brave new nation, that has such wonders, innit?" asks Professor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dancing maniacally around a laboratory filled with bubbling multicoloured liquids in complicated glassware. "Let's use this technologiwotsit to make @@NAME@@ the most cleverest place in the world. Sure, messing around like this might cause neurological cancers to get more commoner, and has had the side effect of making people less gooder at working together, but people need to get more brainsier, don't they? Braaaaaaaains!"

2. "If everyone is an egomaniac intellectual, then who will take out the trash or lift a hod of bricks?" asks Director of Social Engineering @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Do breed an intellectual elite of strong-minded Alphas to rule, but also create competent Betas to administrate, obedient Gammas below them, and so on, eventually ending up with dumb Epsilons to do the manual work with a happy grin on their cow-like faces. The economy will thrive with everyone content in their genetically assigned roles!"

3. "Ohmigod, the horror, you have to ban the vats!" yells your brother, waving his arms. "Naaa... I'm just messing with you! What you should actually do is breed everybody to be as dumb as possible. A smart tyrant always gets rid of the intellectuals first, and the best time to do that is before they've even been conceived. Combine pre-birth dumbification with suppressing the morons' education, and there's no reason why you can't rule unchallenged for the rest of our lives."

[b][anchor=1004]#1004[/anchor]: Two Countries and a Baby [Sanctaria; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The case of baby @@RANDOM_NAME_1@@ has captured the hearts of the nation. Born with a devastating neurological disease that has impacted @@HIS@@ entire nervous system, the young @@BOY@@ has been left in a vegetative state, @@HIS@@ organs shutting down. Doctors claim @@HE@@ has no hope for recovery, and have received a court ruling to discontinue life support. On the day @@FIRSTNAME_1@@'s parents tearfully prepare to say goodbye to their child, the neighbouring theocracy of Savoiia has granted the baby citizenship and demands that you intervene in the case and expatriate @@HIM@@ for treatment.

The Debate
1. "Respectfully, as baby @@FIRSTNAME_1@@ is now a citizen of our beautiful and compassionate country, you will allow us to take @@HIM@@ with us," demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the Savoiian Ambassador to @@NAME@@, as @@HE@@ sprinkles holy water on the child's doctors. "We can offer @@HIM_1@@ the care such a precious soul deserves. Our doctors will not only tend to @@HIS_1@@ ailing body, but our people will pray for @@HIS_1@@ immortal soul. We shall also work in hope of a cure, and who knows what untold miracles may come, years from now? And should @@HE_1@@ slip into the hands of Our Great Parent, then at least it will be at Their will, and not at the whim of capricious doctors. Do not give up on @@FIRSTNAME_1@@. Do not condemn @@HIM_1@@ to die. Release @@HIM_1@@ to our custody."

2. "I implore you not to listen to this crackpot," stresses Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a representative of the hospital, putting @@HIS@@ head in @@HIS@@ hands. "Baby @@FIRSTNAME_1@@ is completely beyond the capabilities of modern medicine. For Violet's sake, @@HIS_1@@ condition is so rare, we can't even be sure what it is. Of course I wish we could help @@HIM_1@@. No doctor wants to see their patient die. But to keep @@HIM_1@@ alive is to harm @@HIM_1@@ even further. Moving @@HIM_1@@ now - even to another local hospital, let alone Savoiia - would cause unnecessary physiological stress and potential trauma; @@HE_1@@ probably wouldn't survive the trip. Even if @@HE_1@@ does, @@HE_1@@ will inevitably die there, away from @@HIS_1@@ extended family and supporters. Allow us to make @@HIM_1@@ comfortable here so @@HE_1@@ can die in peace."

The Issue
A series of unfortunate accidents involving the nation's ageing fleet of jet fighters have revealed glaring technical deficiencies in these venerable machines.

The Debate
[1]. "Have I got an offer for you!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, CEO of Blackacre's Bounce Industries, while visibly salivating. "We'll equip you with top of the line fighters, the very latest in stealth technology, superior handling and range, with semi-autonomous flight computers. These machines practically fly themselves - for the right price, of course!" [[color=blue]Must not ban computers[/color]]

2. "Our company can offer you a cheap solution," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the commissar of the JK Sukky Company of East Lebatuck, offering you a broken pen. "Our planes might not be cutting edge, but then, technology is no replacement for skill. Just sign here and my company will begin delivery at once."

3. "We must build our own planes!" screams Air Force Marshall @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The FK-2 @@ANIMAL@@ is a symbol of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ superiority and cannot be replaced by any foreign import. Yes, the fighters have to be modernised, but only with contracts given to local industries."

4. "Do I have the solution for you!" announces @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Fortitude, an art student and aspiring actor. "Why go to all the effort of buying and maintaining a fleet of aircraft that is unlikely to be used anyway? Just PRETEND to have one! Give me some plywood and a few buckets of paint, and I will make you a 'fleet' no one would dare to provoke… as long as they don't look too closely!"

5. "Why bother at all?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister for Austerity, tightening @@HIS@@ already constricted belt. "Our military spending is already bloated beyond belief and it will be the poor taxpayer who has to foot the bill for these planes. We'd be better off without them."

[b][anchor=1006]#1006[/anchor]: Opening the Door to Controversy [Duurfald; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Actor @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME_1@@, the famously tweedy star of superhero franchise [i]Superbloke[/i], has been heavily criticised after an incident at a Shop-Qwik, in which he was accused of "holding back women's rights by holding open doors".

The Debate
1. "Chivalry is just another word used by men who lord it over women!" shouts vlogger for radical feminist website [i]Lady Luck[/i], @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@. "Women are not frail innocents who need shielding from the weight of a door. Opening doors for women is unnecessary at best, and downright demeaning at worst. I say the government should fund advertisements and posters that show positive images of women as strong and powerful, so these patronising oiks will realise that we don't need their help!"

2. "Well, I'm dashed! The way I was raised, it was expected that men should open doors for ladies," says Mr. @@LASTENAME_1@@, leaning lightly on his decorative silver-topped cane. "Protecting the fairer sex is an obligation of every gentleman - like learning to ride astride, box ruffians or dance a manly gavotte - and I'm sure many ladies would prefer feeling cherished by society. Rather than discourage chivalry, we should teach it in schools."

3. "Why should good manners be restricted by sex?" muses freelance etiquette consultant @@RANDOM_NAME@@, holding open the door while smiling and nodding with sabre-toothed politeness until @@FIRSTNAME_1@@ finally exits. "Everyone should show a little consideration for others. Run a campaign to tell all @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ that they have a duty to pause and hold the door for [i]all[/i] the people behind them, to say their 'pleases' and 'thank yous' and to start from the outside and work in when eating a proper eight course meal, gosh darn it. Courtesy costs only time."

4. "Why don't we just replace all conventional doors with automatic doors?" says fringe economist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who part-owns [i]In a Spin Automatic Doors[/i]. "There'd be no need for anyone to cause offence by opening doors for anyone, and just think of all the amazing manufacturing jobs it'd create."

The Issue
While out jogging in the park, you step straight into a dog's mess. Passers-by are quick to offer advice.

The Debate
1. "Disgusting, isn't it?" asks city worker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If you ask me, we need to clamp down on irresponsible dog owners. All public parks should be patrolled by dog wardens, able to dish out heavy fines to those who can't be bothered picking up what their dumb pets' behinds leave behind."

2. "Like that's going to make any difference," sneers professional dog-walker @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The problem is a lack of places to dispose of the stuff. Nobody wants to carry around a smelly bag of doo-doo until they can find a place to put it. Install more bins, and that should do the trick."

3. "Ugh, dogs are so disgusting," complains ailurophile @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as the pet cat accompanying @@HIM@@ drops a dead bird at @@HIS@@ feet and cleans its paws with its tongue. "Felines are much lovelier than dogs; they groom themselves constantly, and do their business in a tray, not outside like those mangy canines do. With that in mind, I propose that we restrict the ownership of dogs with hefty license fees, and use that money on a national campaign promoting the virtues of cats instead."

[b][anchor=1008]#1008[/anchor]: Wash Your Mouth Out! [The Kind-of-United States; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The League of Concerned Moms has successfully petitioned to ban the dictionary from the [i]Little @@ANIMAL@@ Elementary School[/i], to be replaced with a "Clean-tionary" of "pleasant" words. The reason? It contained "lewd and offensive" words referring to private parts of the body. On the day you collect your niece from school, you are confronted by picketers holding signs with boldly-lettered suggestions of where the concerned moms might like to stick their "Clean-tionary" and chanting inventive invective-filled rhymes about censorship.

The Debate
1. "We need to protect children from seeing bad words!" demands @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the white-clad leader of the League of Concerned Moms. "Our delicate flowers must be shielded from all bad influences. Just yesterday, my five-year-old came home, saying his classmate called him a '[expletive deleted] [expletive deleted] whose mother was [expletive deleted] [expletive deleted] [expletive deleted]'. And where do you think those words were found? That's right! The dictionary! Where any innocent child can chance upon them. Remove all harmful words from schools' dictionaries and let our beautiful pearls thrive."

2. "All you big people are cramping my style," groans third-grader @@RANDOM_NAME@@, giggling over the term 'poop deck'. "Dictionaries are great; I can learn whatever words I want! Words are GREAT. They give kids the power to say what we really think. Yesterday, I called my teacher a 'big bum-bailiff'. You can't take that away. You need to keep the fun words in the dictionary, and add more, so we can... um, express ourselves." @@HE@@ grabs the dictionary protectively and hisses, "Precious words!"

3. "We need to look at the root of this problem," soothes psychologist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who has an office across the street with 'Appointments Available' in the window. "All this is the result of bad influence. These poor, misguided children don't know better. They see a cuss word, and yell it to the world. It's simply a combination of poor impulse control and a need to impress their peer group. Well, no longer! Schools should have psychologists on staff, and as soon as these troubled angels go astray, we can help them find their own way back to the right road."

4. "I agree that this is serious," notes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Let's-All-Just-Calm-Down. "But it's not just the kids who are dirtying the air with foul language. The adults are also at fault. We should fund an official @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ dictionary of approved words, free from all expletives, coarse words, vulgar expressions and terms for the unpleasant parts of human anatomy, and punish anyone who uses any bad word – in books, media, and written and spoken speech. Only then can @@NAME@@ be a truly pleasant place to live. Now, shall we have a cup of tea?"

[b][anchor=1009]#1009[/anchor]: A Woman's Roll [The Free Joy State; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
A survey by the socially conservative special interest group [i]Society for the Prevention of Ominous, Unusual and Substandard Edibles[/i] found that 14.3% of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ husbands hate their wife's cooking, with a further 28.6% secretly describing their wife as "just not a very good cook, really". Lead researchers Peterson and Wason warn that bad food could cause marital discord, malnutrition and jaw strain due to excessive mastication.

The Debate
*1. A researcher wheels in a television and turns it on, to reveal an anonymised male. "My mummy was the best cook," sighs the voice, obscured by a synthesiser and sounding vaguely like a duck. "Filet of beef in peppercorn sauce and shepherd's pie with braised lamb. My wife [i]does[/i] make shepherd's pie three times a week, but she uses beef, and sometimes tomatoes. Honest to Violet. I told her that my mummy said that's more of a cottage pie, but she just... she keeps doing it.@@LEADER@@, send our wives to compulsory subsidised cookery classes, so they'll learn to cook, just like our mummies used to.

*2. A researcher wheels in a television and turns it on, to reveal an anonymised male. "My mummy was the best cook," sighs the voice, obscured by a synthesiser and sounding vaguely like a duck. "Garlic mushrooms and ratatouille. My wife [i]does[/i] make ratatouille three times a week, but she puts basil in it, potatoes too. Honest to Violet. I told her that my mummy said that's not traditional, but she just... she keeps doing it. @@LEADER@@, send our wives to compulsory subsidised cookery classes, so they'll learn to cook, just like our mummies used to.

3. "Why can't he make his own goddamn meals?" demands @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, of Stressed Wives Not-so-Anonymous, shoving the TV-trolley out of the door and sending it careening along a corridor and down a flight of stairs. "He sounds just like my @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@. Always whining. Look, @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ women are too busy to be farting around with all that gourmet manure. When I come home from work, I have kids to care for, the house to clean, and [i]then[/i] I make a meal for five people. If His Highness helped me out, I'd get some me-time, and he might finally get a meal he's happy with. Run a national campaign to tell husbands that they have an obligation to get off their butts and help their wives."

4. "This sad attitude indicates a much deeper problem," sighs chauvinist psychiatrist @@RANDOM_MALE_NAME@@, whose wife stands next to him, smiling unblinkingly and holding his half-eaten sandwich. "Women have lost the joy of service. Modern society tells women to distrust their head of household, which causes insecurity. Insecure women argue, which causes stress. Stressed women perform their functions haphazardly, if at all. Women would be happier, families would be more stable, if disobedient wives were returned to their naturally submissive state, through drugs, electroshock and frontal lobotomies as necessary. Remember, if a woman doesn't live to serve her master, something is wrong psychologically."

The Issue
A newly-imported brand of coffee from Macronesia has a rather funny name: W'Anc. The implications of this 'lost in translation' event have been causing quite a stir.

The Debate
1. "Here, you must taste W'Anc before passing judgement," insists the Macronesian ambassador, pouring coffee into your mouth, leaving you to either spit out or swallow. "This drink very popular in my country, the beans are pressed between the buttocks of exotic maidens! Maybe name is a bit funny here in @@NAME@@, but this can be the learning moment for all. Instead of laughing, maybe be teaching @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ to learn about different cultures and be appreciating of our fine liquids. Now my friend, you want another W'Anc? It's the best!"

2. "That name is intentionally rude," proclaims Sasha Popov, leader of morality group Teachers Improving Societal Sophistication Until Excellence. "We cannot allow such vulgarity to exist within @@NAME@@. Can you imagine teenagers going to a coffee shop and asking for a… I shudder to think! You must force this distastefully-named product to be rebranded, and fine any organisation that puts offensive words in the public eye."

3. "Hey, check out this picture I've got here," proclaims your niece, who's been chuckling to herself the whole time. "My friend, who is in Smalltopia, sent me this picture after she saw this sign in the window of a laundromat there. It says 'drop your pants here'! You should make a law that states all businesses must have funny mistakes in their advertising. The laughter therapy will make @@NAME@@ the happiest place in the world!"

[b][anchor=1011]#1011[/anchor]: State of the Media [Singapore no2; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
According to recent surveys conducted by the National Broadcasting Agency, viewership of state media has hit a record low. This has resulted in a wave of officials and state-sponsored journalists seeking your advice on how to improve the situation.

The Debate
1. "We could accommodate more alternative views," proposes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a talk show host, speaking with you on live television. "@@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ tend to view our state-approved programmes as blatant government propaganda. If we were to spice up our newspaper opinion columns and interviews with a greater variety of voices, then even the staunchest critics of state media won't be able to say that we're biased." 

2. "I think that it's a matter of trust," concedes the head of the Department of Truthiness, while writing a puff piece about your pet @@ANIMAL@@. "We shouldn't cushion our people from the harsh truths of our nation, if that's what they truly want. Unlike what the national papers say, we don't actually have full employment or zero crime. We must release every single statistic being tracked in our country, and hope that our citizens can believe in us." 

3. "The only true solution is to force everyone to watch our shows," whispers the Minister of Internal Security, handing you a prototype screen. "We should install these modified televisions in every single household. They have built-in microphones and security cameras so that we can keep our citizens under constant surveillance. People who attempt to ignore state media by switching off their televisions will be identified, and taken away for a bit of re-education on how to be a proper citizen." 

4. "That would be a hideous waste of @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@!" objects the State Treasurer, showing you a number of charts that all seem to blend together. "If no one wants to view official media, then they don't have to. We should scrap the entire thing and let the public come up with their own sources of information and entertainment. The resources could be allocated to somewhere else, like on strengthening our military and funding law enforcement."

The Issue
An unprecedented spectacle unfolded yesterday when Minister of Energy Don Lamancha was attending a conference on alternate energy resources. Lamancha is reported to have attacked a wind turbine with an improvised spear, all the time shouting loudly that it was trying to kill him. It turns out that the minister was suffering from schizophrenia, which he had not previously disclosed for fear of losing his job.

The Debate
1. "My behaviour was completely uncalled for," apologizes Lamancha. "My medication timings were a little mixed up by all the travelling, and I genuinely believed for a moment that the wind turbine was a giant. I assure you, I am still capable of doing my job, and it would be a good thing for this country if you were to show some kindness here. No-one should be discriminated against because of mental illness."

2. "He must stand down!" grandiosely demands your Secretary of State Sigmund Narcissus, stepping directly in front of the Energy Minister with clear intent to exclude the man. "It's fine for mentally weak people to participate in low-level jobs like pizza delivery or drink-bottling, but they have no business being in government. Imagine the danger that we would face if we left cruise missile launch codes with a psychotic individual! Politicians with mental disorders must be given the sack."

3. "That doesn't go far enough!" screams your National Security Advisor, who appears to be wearing a highly-reflective helmet. "How can we be sure that people with mental disorders won't poison our food or sabotage our infrastructure in a fit of madness? We must bar them completely from all forms of employment. That way-" He stops abruptly and glares suspiciously at a nearby television. "Can we adjourn to another room? I think we're being spied on."

The Issue
A group of teenagers have stumbled across an abandoned graveyard in the highest mountains of @@NAME@@ containing bodies infected with a new, unknown, and deadly strain of Maxtopian Pox — a disease previously thought eradicated. With the infected teenagers isolated in hospital, you have called an emergency meeting with top virologists to discuss available options.

The Debate
1. "This virus, inadvertently reactivated following permafrost excavation, was thought to be fully eradicated a few decades ago," exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing a full hazmat suit. "If it spreads, it could cause devastation in @@NAME@@ on an unprecedented scale! Simply put, both our immune systems and the pharmacological armory are not prepared to face this threat. We must quarantine ground zero and offer vaccinations to nearby settlements, unless you want a pandemic on your hands."

2. "Humanity eradicated the Maxtopian Pox by vaccinating every single person," whispers public health official @@RANDOM_NAME@@, trying to stick a needle in you. "But these days, we have become complacent. In preparation for the inevitable outbreak, we must mandate routine vaccination against the Maxtopian Pox for everyone! Those who refuse to be vaccinated should face fines and be locked down in their own homes to prevent the disease from spreading."

3. "Deadly disease, you say?" cheerfully asks one of your more jingoistic advisers. "This is a great opportunity to bolster our military presence in @@REGION@@, and you're just letting it go to waste! I say dig up the bodies, bring them to the totally non-existent Area 50, and use them as biological weapons! Everyone's going to think twice about attacking us now!"

4. "You can save humanity by saving the planet!" yells a messy-looking teenage protester who just entered your office through a window. "Climate change is causing the ice to melt, releasing deadly diseases that have been trapped for centuries. To prevent epidemics, we must stop climate change. Enforce tougher environmental regulations in @@NAME@@. Eliminate carbon emissions! Forget the immediate crisis; we have to prevent future ones!"

Despite the government of @@NAME@@ officially being opposed to religion, national surveys reveal that a significant percentage of the population continues to have religious beliefs.

The Debate
1. "Let's be methodical, shall we?" asks Lieutenant Colonel Dolf Ikeman rhetorically, carefully placing a glass vial containing prussic acid onto your desk. "Opposing the state line on religion is just one step away from opposing the state line on ideology or law. Round up these religious dissidents, load them onto a cargo train, and move them to processing camps for... [i]terminal processing[/i]."

2. "Let's be reasonable, shall we?" pleads schoolteacher @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Just because you and I have reached the intelligent conclusion, it doesn't mean we have to force others to do so. Instead, invest in education, and teach our children critical thinking skills and scientific reasoning. That way, they rationally choose atheism for themselves when they come of age."

3. "Let's be questioning, shall we?" suggests an uncertain-looking agnostic, who isn't sure whether @@HE@@ should tell you @@HIS@@ name. "It's hubris equal to that of the religions for us to assume that [i]we[/i] know all the answers. Moderate your government's stance from atheism to agnosticism, and openly state that freedom of religious belief is enshrined in law."

The Issue
Vlad Leopold, the despised Tasmanian war criminal and international fugitive, was recently captured by the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ police while in hiding just outside of @@CAPITAL@@. With members of the international community wanting to see justice, the question of jurisdiction has arisen.

The Debate
1. "This dastardly fiend committed numerous crimes against humanity," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prosecutor from the @@REGION@@ Criminal Court. "Therefore, it is obvious that Leopold's trial falls under the jurisdiction of the international court. We'll start legal proceedings against him, adhering to the letter of the law, and in less than five years his sentence will be announced."

2. "This monster killed my father," snarls the Tasmanian ambassador @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wiping tears of anger and grief from @@HIS@@ eyes. "Also my sister, my two best friends and my great uncle. My point is, we Tasmanians were wronged by him, and we deserve our retribution. We, the Tasmanian people, must be allowed to prosecute and then punish this genocidal villain." @@HE@@ picks up a set of thumbscrews and looks at you meaningfully.

3. "This arrest was the finest moment of my career, and also a big moment for @@NAME@@," counters @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the national police chief. "Leopold slaughtered a few @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ volunteers in the Tasmanian Civil War, so we can rightfully try him for murdering our own citizens. Everyone can whine all they want, but the fact is they couldn't catch him. We did. It's our sovereign right to try criminals captured on our territory."

4. Finally, a man in dark sunglasses and with a mysterious tattoo of an all-seeing eye on his wrist, whom you don't remember seeing enter the room, whispers in your ear, "What Leopold did wrong wasn't the indiscriminate decimation of the Tasmanian population. It's that he wasn't smart about it. He's got raw potential, sure. If you give him to me, I'll make sure he becomes much more efficient, professional and covert in his work. You can also trust that this time, he'll be working for the good guys."

[b][anchor=1016]#1016[/anchor]: Breaking Upset [The United Providences of Perland; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
While attending a community meeting in an impoverished neighborhood, you hear a commotion nearby. Just as you think you've seen it all, you find a man in his tidy-whities engulfed in flames outside his burning trailer. The cause was meth-making gone wrong.

The Debate
*1. "I'm speechless, I truly am," states local state trooper @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ twirls @@HIS@@ revolver around @@HIS@@ finger. "You want to know the worst part? Just last week the exact same thing happened, just with a different guy. They're a danger to the public and themselves. We must declare war on drugs; let me and my boys eliminate this problem once and for all." [[color=blue]Police have guns[/color]]

*2. "I'm speechless, I truly am," states local state trooper @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as @@HE@@ twirls @@HIS@@ baton around. "You want to know the worst part? Just last week the exact same thing happened, just with a different guy. They're a danger to the public and themselves. We must declare war on drugs; let me and my boys eliminate this problem once and for all." [[color=red]Guns are banned from everyone[/color]]

3. "We can find them, and deliver punishment as we see fit, but it will solve nothing," retorts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a social worker. "What we need is social reform. These people need counseling and addiction programs. If we correct the undie lying - I mean, underlying causes of this, we may actually solve the problem, not add wood to the fire. So throw some funding to social services and it will all work out. Now, hold my jacket and clipboard while I go help this man."

4. "I has a much more betterer idea," mumbles the man who caused all this as he scratches what used to be his eyebrows. "Clearly I done messed up. But, if the gub'ment or whoever teach people like me how to make our product all proper like, we won't be getting into messes like this. Allow those expert fellas to teach us stuff on this and all will be good."

5. "To hell with them all!" proclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a right-wing radio talk-show host, as @@HE@@ puts @@HIS@@ arm around your shoulder. "These people are nothing but human garbage, and in this instance, a flaming pile thereof! Let them maim or kill themselves; if they all die off, there will be no one to make drugs."

[b][anchor=1017]#1017[/anchor]: A Cure for the Black Market [Baggieland; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
A recent flu epidemic that side-lined half your government was made worse when it was discovered the medication taken for it was fake.

The Debate
1. "This is a huge problem," sighs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Chief Customs Officer, as @@HE@@ wipes @@HIS@@ brow for the umpteenth time. "Nearly all of the counterfeit medicine in @@REGION@@ is produced in Dàguó. Their criminal gangs are producing copious amounts of every type of medication available. Sure, we do intercept some of it, but we're only seizing the tip of the iceberg. The customs department needs more officers and modern, state-of-the-art equipment if we're to stop this illegal trade." 

2. "The problem IS the customs department!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, an ex-trafficker turned informant, speaking with a masked voice and with @@HIS@@ face obscured from vision. "These Dàguó gangs aren't just filling the occasional container with fake drugs; they're filling entire container ships! That's millions of @@CURRENCY@@ in one shipload. How do you think an entire ship gets cleared at customs? A complete overhaul of customs staff is what you need." 

3. "The black market only exists because of the demand for 'unofficial' drugs," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who sells bottles of medication with handwritten labels from his market stall. "My customers are all poor, working-class people - they simply can't afford Big Pharma's price tag. You government fellas should be encouraging a more open market, and stop going after honest traders like myself. Now, I heard you might be interested in a few x-ray machines. I've got a mate, who's got a mate, who's got a mate who can help you out there. The instruction book is all in some foreign lingo, but I'm sure you can figure it out." 

4. "You know, with the placebo effect, even fake medications can be quite efficacious," observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your scientific advisor. "Most treatments, real or fake, mostly work because patients believe in them. You could save a lot of money through a press release which states that a @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ scientist has invented a miraculous, one-pill-cures-all wonder drug. It'll be cheap to produce as the main ingredients are only sugar and water. It will also stop the illegal trade of counterfeit medication, as demand will cease. What could possibly go wrong?"

[b][anchor=1018]#1018[/anchor]: Operation Failed [Sacara; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Dr. Henri Jacquil made the headlines yesterday after a mistake made during a routine operation caused the death of your Minister of Foreign Affairs. With the recent advances in the capabilities of artificial intelligence, some in the medical field are wondering if autonomous robot surgeons should be given a whack at surgery.

The Debate
*1. "This seems like a no-brainer to me," states the editor-in-chief of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Medical Journal. "Surgery simply puts too much stress on the surgeons. After all, they're humans with human fallibility. Besides, the artificial intelligence has not yet failed a test run. The precision in which they operate is absolutely stunning and nothing near what the average @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ surgeon can replicate. With healthy investment into this artificial intelligence field, we will turn science fiction into a reality." [[color=purple]Must NOT have AI Citizenry[/color]]

*2. "This seems like a no-brainer to me," states Weaving-Smith, a 3rd-generation AI autonomous agent, who downloaded software to make him into a neurosurgeon just five minutes ago. "Surgery simply puts too much stress on organic surgeons. After all, they're only human. The precision in which a machine can operate is far superior. With healthy investment and government support, we could take surgery into our hands. Or at least, into our stainless steel manipulator attachments." [[color=purple]Must have AI Citizenry[/color]]

3. "I think you're overreacting here," cautions Dr. Jacquil, his hands shaking with what looks suspiciously like narcotics withdrawal. "Everyone makes mistakes every once in a while, even you! The reason that the plebs... I mean patients still come to me is for the human touch, and my empathetic bedside manner! Can a machine offer that? You would be destroying the venerated centuries-old doctor-patient relationship, and putting skilled surgeons out of work! Cutting up meatbags is something that should only be done by a fellow human! Keep these thinking machines away from my operating theatre!"

4. "Why stop at just the operating room doors when there's so much more an AI could do for us?" asks Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Professor of Experimental Gynaecological Robotics, fetching a fresh box of batteries from the top shelf. "We could make hospitals so much more efficient if we allowed them to adopt more roles: diagnostic chatbots, robot nurses, computerised counsellors, and so on. AIs should outnumber humans by at least twenty to one on the hospital staff."

[b][anchor=1019]#1019[/anchor]: Patent Nonsense [Singapore no2; ed: Pogaria][/b]

The Issue
After going online for the first time, the National Patent Registration Database (NPRD) has been inundated with countless patent applications, many of them seemingly jokes. One of the worst offenders was the attempted registration of a so-called 'time machine', which was simply an alarm clock taped to a microwave. Frustrated patent offices are demanding that you do something to stop these joke proposals.

The Debate
1. "It was a mistake to allow the registration of patents online," admits Christina @@RANDOM_LAST_NAME@@, the head of the NPRD, who is hard at work deleting proposals as fast as she receives them. "People with too much free time have been sending us blueprint after blueprint of absolute garbage. In fact, I recall several applications that were trying to patent literal garbage! We should be given a free hand to permanently ban anyone from registering patents if they waste our time."

2. "You must accept all patents regardless of their contents!" demands @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, who is submitting @@HIS@@ 'time machine' application again despite having been rejected at least a dozen times so far. "All inventions have their own merits, and who is to say that something you deem as trash isn't actually a revolutionary gadget in disguise? The pursuit of science is a worthy cause in itself, and to deny innovators their just reward is an insult to their efforts. Let us and our creations finally be recognised!"

3. "I've had enough of this nonsense!" rebukes John Titor, the Director of the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Organisation for Quantum Research, who is infamous for his long rants online. "Our citizens clearly see the concept of patents as a joke, and want to mock our government institutions. We must teach them a lesson by placing the ownership of all patents under the state. I'm sure that qualified officials such as myself will have more use for any new gizmos that are created, and will know how to harness them for the greater good."
