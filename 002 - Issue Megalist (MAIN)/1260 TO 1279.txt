[b][anchor=1260]#1260[/anchor]: Gay Abandoned [Nuremgard; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Today, reports reached @@NAME@@ that @@RANDOMNAME_1@@, a refugee that previously applied for asylum on the basis that @@HIS@@ sexuality is a capital crime in @@HIS@@ home country — only to be sent home when @@HIS@@ application was rejected — has subsequently been executed by @@HIS@@ own government.

The Debate
1. "This is an absolute disgrace!" splutters LGBT activist @@RANDOMNAME@@, draping a giant rainbow version of the national flag around your shoulders. "That poor @@MAN_1@@ lost @@HIS_1@@ life because this cruel government refused @@HIM_1@@ sanctuary! What kind of nation will not give people refuge from cruel and despotic regimes? Allow automatic asylum on the basis of persecution for sexual orientation!"

2. "How was I meant to know @@HE_1@@ was telling the truth?" exclaims the immigration official who refused the @@MAN_1@@'s entry, distractedly adjusting the green carnation in @@HIS@@ lapel. "@@HE_1@@ could have been lying just so @@HE_1@@ could get into the country to take advantage of our generosity! How about we ask supposedly gay migrants to prove their sexuality? We could ask them questions that only a gay person would know, and only let people who pass into the country."

3. "You know, this raises the broader issue of immigration," announces your Finance Minister, dispensing financial projections with a little flourish. "We have an ageing population, so why worry about whether ‘x' is cause for asylum but ‘y' isn't? All suffering is equal, especially that of the public coffers. How about we loosen the immigration rules, rubber-stamping asylum applications from all people who arrive able and willing to live and work here."

4. "That this @@MAN_1@@ died is unfortunate, of course," drawls the famously understated author of [i]Do Stop Being Silly[/i], an analysis of brutal tyrants throughout the ages. "But we have a moral duty to care for our citizens, not every citizen of every country — no matter how unpleasant those countries may be. In fact, we ought to tighten the rules, so that only people with truly valuable skills can immigrate here."

5. "Why are we letting filthy gay people in in the first place?" asks the furious far-right author of anti-LGBT treatise [i]Dressed to Repress[/i] @@RANDOMNAME@@, who is hiding from your other visitors inside a closet. "We all know these people are disordered and disposed to vice. @@HIS_1@@ country has the right idea: protecting their people. If nations want to punish their citizens in accordance with their law, we should send them back immediately. Then we can clean up our act at home, with mandatory conversion therapy for all people with same-sex attraction. It [i]is[/i] a kindness: no-one can be happy being who they are when they're different to other people. Mother was right — you just can't."

[b][anchor=1261]#1261[/anchor]: Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better [Chan Island; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Yesterday evening, talk radio pundit @@RANDOMNAME_1@@ launched a scathing critique of your "ridiculously incompetent Transport Minister" and the minister's "terrible mismanagement of timetables". Unfortunately, said minister angrily phoned in to argue @@HIS@@ case, and foolishly told the talkshow host that if @@HE@@ thought @@HE@@ could do better, @@HE@@'d be welcome to try. Somewhat predictably, @@LASTNAME_1@@ is now outside the parliament building, ready to give it a go.

The Debate
1. "Look at @@HIM_1@@ strutting about, that know-it-all, trying to tell the public how my damn job should be done," snarls your extremely experienced Transport Minister. "What the hell does @@HE_1@@ know about fuel logistics, or network maintenance, or sub-contract management? Absolutely jack nothing, that's what! Broadcasters shouldn't be allowed to offer unfounded opinions about things they know nothing about. Slap a fine on her for misleading the public and fomenting ignorance — that'll teach @@HIM_1@@ to mind @@HIS_1@@ words."

2. "That's a little... extreme," cautions one of the minister's aides, serving up a tray of calming hot cocoas. "The truth is that a free media will always attract larger-than-life types to pontificate on whatever subject they want, and that's a great thing. Sure, maybe this radio host is clueless, but we should always encourage lively discussion on our airwaves. Maybe instead what we need is a more managed media presence, with ministers always consulting with their teams before making radio appearances. If we're more careful about what we say, we'll avoid situations like this one."

3. "Hey, let's have a bit of fun with this..." suggests one of your grinning junior transport staffers. "Let's let @@HIM_1@@ into the building, and put @@HIM_1@@ in charge of the department for a whole week, with everything broadcast live on air. Then, we pile @@HIM_1@@ with jobs that @@HE_1@@ can screw up. Ask @@HIM_1@@ whether the switchboard generator in @@CAPITAL@@ should be powered up at 215 or 230 megawatts. Probe @@HIM_1@@ for specifics on the emerging empty boat situation. Ask @@HIM_1@@ what the optimum running speed is for track temperature management. We make @@HIM_1@@ look like a fool, and the public gets a better appreciation of how hard our job is."

Every year, several deaths are reported in the country due to the eating of the highly poisonous, yet savoured, pufferfish.

The Debate
1. "It's straight up suicide!" proclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, while puffing @@HIS@@ cheeks out in exasperation. "This deadly dish claimed the life of one of my close friends, and kills diners every month! This culinary death-trap must be banned!"

2. "Eating this fish has been our tradition, passed down by our... grandfathers maybe..." says renowned chef @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ Kuraoka, as @@HE@@ puts a pufferfish on your desk to demonstrate how easily prepared it is. "It all depends on how skilled you are. See: poison... poison... poison... tasty fish!

The Issue
It took approvals for dubious government expenses claims, the surprising discovery of your name endorsing documents you have never seen, and your niece getting away with cutting school before government officials realized your signature had been forged. Now your office is, as usual, full of advisers willing to give their two pens on the issue.

The Debate
1. "This is the result of insufficient security checks," suggests @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Complicating Things. "If every signature across the nation required a counter-signature, forgery-resistant inks, a DNA test, family history checks, and an authenticity report produced by a staffer of my Ministry, I can ensure such forgeries would become a thing of the past!"

[2]. "Signatures themselves are already a thing of the past," grumbles Bigtopian Technology Minister @@RANDOMNAME@@, videoing in from @@HIS/HER@@ country. "No need to sign up for a process that can take weeks to complete.

The Issue
Recent floods devastated low-lying areas, and the affected areas are only just starting to recover. Now, news is emerging that during the disaster many local retailers were found to have significantly elevated prices for basic necessities such as water, blankets, flashlights, and matsutake mushrooms.

The Debate
1. "The sheer nerve!" gasps disaster survivor and multimillionaire actor @@RANDOMNAME@@, who is wearing nothing but an old potato sack to elicit sympathy. "After we've lost everything, these predators had the nerve to profit from human suffering? These price gougers didn't care how much they were hurting people, so the government must care. Fix prices in place for the duration of any disaster, and shut down any store that refuses to comply!"

2. "Fixing prices in place isn't enough," argues charity worker @@RANDOMNAME@@, pushing aside the disaster victim so @@HE@@ can take center stage. "Retailers can set whatever prices they want throughout the year, but during times of disaster they should be forced to discount basic necessities, for the sake of human kindness. These big companies can easily afford a temporary loss, and this way disaster victims don't have to choose between bread and batteries."

3. "If they don't like the free market, they shouldn't be living in @@NAME@@!" snaps Mega-Mart CEO @@RANDOMNAME@@, phoning in from @@HIS@@ beach condo in sunny Manamana. "Look, our primary moral and legal responsibility is to our shareholders. Our prices are our own business, but hey, if the government is so desperate to give stuff for free to disaster victims, why don't you just buy stock from us? We'll even give you a bulk discount for goods near their expiry date, and that way everyone wins."

4. "Power to the People! Potatoes for the Proletariat!" chants pro-communalist speaker @@RANDOMNAME@@, whose father is said to own half of @@ANIMAL@@ County. "I ask you, why isn't the government mass-producing and storing long-life foodstuffs, in order to distribute them for free during times of crisis and national emergency?"

The Issue
@@RANDOMNAME_1@@ recently won your party's primary for a crucial seat despite a never-ending slew of controversies. @@HE_1@@'s brash, impolite, and frequently resorts to schoolyard insults, but @@HIS_1@@ supporters are fervent and unwavering. Your advisers worry that further association with @@HIM_1@@ will cost you votes in the next election.

The Debate
1. "We must immediately replace @@HIM_1@@ with someone competent as soon as possible!" exclaims your campaign strategist after hyperventilating into a paper bag. "This extremist only appeals to the fringes of the party, not real voters. We will pay dearly if we're seen supporting and working with people like @@HIM_1@@. This @@MAN_1@@ is a ticking time bomb of controversies that explodes every hour! Ditch @@HIM_1@@ for the sake of your survival! And for the sake of common decency of course."

2. "All this hooey is exactly why we voted for @@HIM_1@@ in first place!" chastises local pig farmer @@RANDOMNAME@@, @@HIS@@ pants covered in what you hope is mud. "You've lost touch with the common man's problems, @@LEADER@@. @@RANDOMNAME_1@@ gets us. @@HE_1@@'s not polished and @@HE_1@@'s not fake like a career politician. @@HE_1@@ may not be polite, but @@HE_1@@ speaks the truth and damn whoever doesn't like it! @@HE_1@@'s got the gumption to put you and your corrupt friends in your place!"

3. "The problem is the lack of vetting at the nomination process," suggests @@RANDOMNAME@@ of the party's South @@NAME@@ Riding Association. "The allegations against @@HIM_1@@ didn't come out until after the nomination took place so our hands were tied. We need better screening of potential candidates, extensive background checks, weeding out problematic beliefs, and the ability to swap out candidates if any... undesirable nominees slip through the cracks."

The Issue
It's been identified that among male prisoners, the prevalence of transgenderism is four times that of the general population.

The Debate
1. "The immediate problem here is the rights of trans prisoners," asserts Alex @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, a transgender activist, who currently identifies as ‘don't know, don't care'. "It simply isn't safe for transfemme prisoners to mix with the general male population. When deciding whether to send someone to a male or female correctional institution, we should ensure that all assignments are made according to identified, not assigned, gender."

2. "Look, transferring inmates that look like men into female prisons is asking for trouble," states @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister for Solutions, as you hand @@HIM@@ today's crossword puzzle and give up trying to complete it before @@HE@@ does. "They might be pretending, they might not. However, you have to keep men and women in different prisons. This isn't about gender identity, this is about preventing pregnancy in prison and managing violence risk. We should build separate wings for these prisoners to ensure everyone's safety."

3. "No, these are just jailbirds pretending to be trans to try to make their time cushier," declares Head Warden @@RANDOMMALENAME@@, as he flicks your light switch on and off several times. "They're looking to receive special perks, such as separate cells and showering alone. We ought to take ‘gender-identity' off our databases, and only record ‘biological sex'. That's the only metric that matters in running efficient and safe prisons."

4. "Four times is probably an underestimate, as many transgender people may be afraid to reveal themselves," expresses @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Equality, as @@HE@@ places the chairs in your office equidistant from each other, perhaps taking @@HIS@@ duties too literally. "It's not hard to suppose that we as a society are suffering from institutionalised transphobia, resulting in trans people being marginalised or over-convicted. We need society-wide education programs, to banish this bigotry. Then, maybe, we'll not see so many transgender people behind bars."

At a recent event you attended, your security detail was suddenly roused to action by a spate of unknown transmissions loudly received on their ear pieces. After quickly ensuring your safety, guards soon traced the source back to an amateur radio club innocently setting up operations in a nearby lot.

The Debate
1. "Aren't ham radios great?" exclaims tweenaged club member @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ Marconi, gleefully turning dials on some kind of base station. "With one of these, a person can talk to friends across town, or fellow enthusiasts all the way on the other side of @@REGION@@! You should make sure every kid in @@NAME@@ has the opportunity to learn about and use these radios!

2. "I'm delighted to see so much interest in this technology!" remarks your Minister for Bureaucratizing Everything, writing down their remarks to file away later. "We should dedicate a certain segment of the nation's frequency spectrum for such enthusiasts! We just need some regulations to avoid conflicts like what occurred today— I know! Certifications!

"Think of how many @@DEMONYMNOUNPLURAL@@ were forced to share a carriage with @@HIM_1@@, or, heaven forbid, had to occupy the sweat-drenched seat @@HE_1@@ left behind @@HIM_1@@!"

When a celebrity power couple like pro-footballer @@RANDOMMALENAME@@ and fashion model and former pop starlet @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@ marries, there's bound to be some glitz and glamour. In fact, thanks to @@FEMALEFIRSTNAME_1@@'s obsession with being a "fairytale princess" the beachside wedding also involved many tonnes of glitter, which is now drifting across the nearby lagoon, raising an important question — what about the mess?

The Debate
1. "Oh right, yah, the mess," notes the newlywed footballer, brushing pink and silver shimmering flakes off his lapel. "Yah, you should probably clean that up. We pay enough taxes already, so go do your job now. Here, go buy yourself something nice afterwards, yah?" He tosses his platinum credit card at you dismissively.

2. "You can't just buy your way out of an ecological disaster," complains dour-faced environmentalist @@RANDOMNAME@@, whose scowling expression whilst photo-bombing has already ruined most of the wedding photos. "Microplastic fragments like this are detrimental to ocean life and can work their way up the food chain as well, causing damage to larger organisms. These irresponsible airhead celebrities should be prosecuted under the full weight of environmental law, and glitter must be banned!"

3. "C'mon mate, there's no need to suck all the colour out of the world," argues eucalyptus-grower @@RANDOMNAME@@, tossing a handful of pink-and-gold flakes in your hair. "There's such a thing as biodegradable glitter you know.

4. "Awww but the glitter is LUVVERLY," coos the blushing bride, her ultra-thin arms flapping as they catch a weak breeze.

"It's a necessary tool to keep the public safe and aware of all the creeps that are out there. If we give a little more funding to our boys and girls in blue, we'll have it up in no time.

"While no doubt this is a national tragedy, we have a chance to reinvent and renew that tired building to bring it into the modern age.

1. "This is immoral!

"Universities should have a balanced syllabus, not be indoctrinating young minds into some cult of personality.

Though religious belief was classified as a mental disorder, it has proven resistant to treatment, leading to the overcrowding of many mental institutions. In response, you have been invited to visit the @@CAPITAL@@ Lunatic Asylum.

The Debate
1. "I can't believe I'm saying this, but we [i]can[/i] try reasoning with these people," suggests nurse @@RANDOMNAME@@, sighing over an illegible chart. "Of course, we need more facilities and staff to handle all the patients, but our current treatment methods aren't working.

Equipped with knowledge and trained in critical thinking, they will come to see the light."

2. "The zealots aren't changing their minds because we've been too soft on them," rasps the asylum's director, appearing from behind a corner. "The government should also allow us to use 'enhanced' conversion techniques, if you know what I mean. Also, we must have funding and permission to research and employ powerful drugs that will facilitate a change of faith. Our conversion therapies will surely work then!"

3. "There is a reason why we decided to put them in hospitals," argues @@RANDOMNAME@@, a fervent atheist clinician. "Religion has brought nothing but suffering to the world.

[b][anchor=1275]#1275[/anchor]: You Cruise, You Lose? [Pogaria; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
For years, small towns along the nation's coast have been popular cruise ship destinations. However, with increasingly frequent visits by overwhelming numbers of passengers, one seaside town is attempting to ban all tourist vessels from stopping there.

The Debate
*1. "These massive ships have polluted our coastal waters, driven away all the fish and caused sizeable erosion damage with their wakes," declares @@RANDOMNAME@@, spokesperson for the town's commercial fishing consortium. "My colleagues and I used to be able to make a decent living from harvesting the abundant resources of our coastal waters. But ever since these bilge-spewing behemoths started showing up, we've had to sail out farther and farther, and still can't catch more than a few minnows. The only way to ensure our industry's survival is to allow this ban to go through." [[color=blue]Must not be vegetarian[/color]]

*2. "These massive ships have polluted our coastal waters, poisoned our kelp farms and caused sizeable erosion damage with their wakes," declares @@RANDOMNAME@@, spokesperson for the town's commercial aquatic agriculture consortium. "My colleagues and I used to be able to make a decent living from harvesting the abundant resources of our coastal waters. But ever since these bilge-spewing behemoths started showing up, the kelp harvest has been failing, and what we do pick has a bad taste to it. The only way to ensure our industry's survival is to allow this ban to go through." [[color=red]Must be vegetarian[/color]]

3. "Are you insane? Those tourists bring in tons of money," sputters restaurant owner @@RANDOMNAME@@, drying a handful of utensils with a rag that looks dirtier than the floor. "I can charge these camera-toting cruisers five @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ for a glass of water, and twelve for a sandwich — and they'll happily pay it! The government should be encouraging tourism with an international advertising campaign."

4. "Businesses can't function without customers, but we need corporate responsibility from the cruise line operators. What if we just apply fines every time they violate our town's natural beauty?" suggests local police officer @@RANDOMNAME@@, opening a new bag of plastic hand restraints labeled ‘now 20% more circulation-restricting!' "Chemical pollution, constant noise, tourists urinating in the fountains — all of these abhorrent side effects can be curbed by giving local governments the power to issue punitive fines. Of course, you should also hold CEOs more directly accountable..." He twirls a pair of handcuffs with a grin on his face.

The Issue
The Coastguard reported that following stormy weather a trio of small ships capsized in the @@ANIMAL@@ Strait. This resulted in the deaths of 78 illegal immigrants who were trying to enter @@NAME@@ under cover of darkness, including many children and two pregnant women.

The Debate
1. "It's our moral responsibility to stop people drowning in our waters," lectures Maritime Operations Officer @@RANDOMNAME@@, respectfully removing @@HIS@@ cap. "You should deploy more coastguard vessels, linked to surveillance drones and a dedicated networked HQ. Give me an eye on every square metre of our seas, and no-one will drown again."

2. "Why don't we just lay out a welcome mat while we're at it?" complains Immigration Minister @@RANDOMNAME@@, closing the office door to keep a draught out. "The danger of the journey acts as a deterrent, and that keeps illegal immigration numbers down. If anything, we should be reducing the coastguard, and concentrating solely on protecting fishermen, beach-users and marina businesses. If the journey across the strait is even more dangerous, then even fewer illegals will attempt the journey."

3. "It's because of our immigration laws that people are dying in the first place," muses your Minister for Extracartonic Cognition. "Why don't we provide a free ferry service to bring anyone who wants to come into the country? We'll also need unrestricted immigration and generous compassionate welfare payments. I'm sure these unskilled immigrants will boost our economy. Eventually."

The Issue
Heavyweight boxer @@RANDOMNAME@@ faced a lot of criticism when — during a press conference before a title fight — @@HE@@ yelled at @@HIS@@ opponent that @@HE@@ was planning to "[i]smash in your skull, bash your brain pan, and send you to the morgue[/i]". This prediction proved to be true, with a punch to the temple fracturing @@HIS@@ opponent's skull, killing @@HIM@@. Now people are asking if the boxer should be held to account for @@HIS@@ words and actions.

The Debate
1. "That was just trash talk!" yells the boxer, punching the wall angrily. "It's not like I actually wanted to kill @@HIM@@. You can't hold an athlete accountable for what happens in a sporting arena. Write that down. Make it a law." @@HE@@ waves a fist at you for emphasis.

2. "We all heard the threats, then watched the murder happen!" weeps @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, mother to the deceased boxer. "This was a premeditated act, a killer punch aimed in a way that he knew would be lethal! The law needs to recognise that threats are threats and crime is crime, no matter the sporting context."

3. "Why is it so surprising that when pitting psychos against each other, death happens?" asks action movie actor @@RANDOMNAME@@, brushing foundation onto @@HIS@@ cheeks. "Look, what you should do is ban boxing and other combat sports. If people want to see exciting fight action, they can watch me — or my team of carefully trained stunt doubles — simulate fighting on the silver screen. It's called acting, darling, and it's what we civilised sorts prefer."

[b][anchor=1278]#1278[/anchor]: A Textbook Cover-Up? [Lislandia; ed: Altmer Dominion][/b]

The Issue
The newest edition of the nation's leading history textbook, [i]@@NAME@@: A Complete Record[/i], has generated serious controversy after critics noted the omission of an infamous massacre that nearly led to the extinction of an aboriginal @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ tribe.

The Debate
1. "The omission was a deliberate choice," declares CEO @@RANDOMNAME@@ of McBlah-Shill, the publisher who issues the textbook in question. "There is a serious lack of primary source information regarding the event, so anything we publish would rely heavily on unreliable secondhand accounts." Leaning in a little closer and speaking lower so only you can hear, @@HE@@ adds: "The fact is, schools are less inclined to invest in material that is both depressing and uncomfortable to talk about. It turns out that parents would prefer their children receive the most positive image of our country possible, and tend to complain otherwise."

2. "Take a wild guess why original documentation on this topic is so sparse!" exclaims indigenous @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ @@RANDOMNAME@@ as @@HE@@ spits into your complimentary copy of the offending textbook before slamming it shut. "Your mainstream society has made every effort to conceal or destroy any evidence that might shed light on these atrocities, and with this latest incident you risk repeating the mistakes of the past. Please, @@LEADER@@, we mustn't whitewash the historical narrative. Regardless of how painful it may be, we owe it to ourselves and to the victims of this genocide — to my people — to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."

3. "So what if some dumb event got left out?" stammers your nephew, a straight-D student attending the prestigious Springtide High. "You can't expect a country's entire history to fit into a single textbook! Plus, with all the subjects we're required to learn already, it's any wonder we retain anything at all! I say we cut the humanities altogether — history, philosophy, the arts — heck, even reading! Who cares as long as kids can speak the language?"

[b][anchor=1279]#1279[/anchor]: Crate Work, Plane and Simple [Candensia; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Officials from the tiny, allied nation of Prudenlund have requested that @@NAME@@ assist in a series of humanitarian aid airdrops to one of its distant territories. The target for the drops — a chain of sparsely-inhabited islands recently ravaged by storms — has been difficult for Prudenlundian authorities to reach, as their nation lacks sufficient transport assets.

The Debate
1. "We have everything ready to go, just nothing for all of it to go in," moans the Prudenlundian Ambassador to @@NAME@@. "The island chain is too distant for our smaller aircraft, and sea delivery will take too long. That's why we'd appreciate it if our friends in @@NAME@@ could spare a few military transport aircraft, and carry out the drops for us. We only really need the planes, but if @@NAME@@ would like to provide additional supplies to drop, soap or unwanted clothes or something, that'd be great too."

2. "Look man, I'd be down with sendin' a couple planes or somethin', but y'all Prudenlund people obviously haven't brought any gas money," says a young, brutally frugal official from the finance ministry's Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Excellence division. "And since y'all don't have gas money, it's gotta be a no on this whole airdrop thing. Ditto for all our other expensive and wasteful aid commitments elsewhere. Tell ya what though, I'll drop a line to the World Assembly or somethin', ask them to help out instead. Y'all got phone money?"

3. "Isn't that island chain famous for its coffee plantations?" muses your Minister for Agriculture. "You know, they're actually direct competitors in coffee exports, and the low strength of their currency is giving them a disproportionate market share. I suggest we deliver the aid, but contaminate the crates with fungus spores, to subtly sabotage their coffee production. We'll look like we're helping while covertly establishing a competitive advantage."
