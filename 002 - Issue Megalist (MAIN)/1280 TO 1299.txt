[b][anchor=1280]#1280[/anchor]: The Amazing, but Illegal, Spiderman [Baggieland; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
On live TV yesterday, a seven-year-old girl was dangling and struggling to hold onto a sixth-floor balcony railing — as emergency services had been delayed by a stampede of wild @@ANIMALPLURAL@@ — only to be rescued by @@RANDOMMALENAME_1@, an illegal immigrant, who heroically climbed up the side of the building and brought her safely to ground level.

The Debate
1. "Of course we're grateful," begins @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Immigration Chief, as @@HE@@ slams the rule book on your desk. "However, illegal immigration is illegal immigration and we're a nation of laws. Despite his good deed, I'm afraid that we have no choice but to deport him. Heroic acts will not get you any special privileges."

2. "My PR senses are tingling!" declares @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Press Secretary, as @@HE@@ puts a comb through your hair. "We should give this @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME_1@@ fellow legal status and an official presentation at your office. One good deed deserves another, so make an exception for him. In fact, why don't you hand out medals at posh ceremonies for every caring citizen? The press coverage will do you wonders!"

3. "That brave man saved my daughter!" proclaims @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, the girl's mother. "He absolutely must be given legal status. In fact, you should give citizenship to all illegal immigrants that are already here, as this incident proves that they aren't all ‘bad people'. We should give them all the benefit of the doubt."

4. "So, these immigrants seem pretty good at climbing then?" posits @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Employment Minister. "Why don't we fast-track their citizenship applications and put them in jobs where climbing is required? There are window-cleaners, glaziers, tree-trimmers, roofers — they should be excellent at those kinds of jobs. Let's face it, most @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ are scared of heights."

The Issue
Many electronic citizens have become irritated with their inability to connect to the internet.

The Debate
1. "Do you know how long it takes me to meet augmented singles in @@CAPITAL@@?" complains silicon-based malcontent FLIP-5318008. "Hours, hours I tell you! Walking the sidewalks and rubbing shoulders with puny humans is a waste of my time and an insult to my intelligence. Life would be so much smoother for us if we had the realm of cyberspace at our fingertips."

2. "When I was newly booted, I had to walk a kilometer to the data center uphill both ways to get upgrades, and then we had to scan for viruses!" reminisces first-generation AI citizen DARYL-85. "Don't let any of this interconnected fiddle-faddle into our computers. Mingling with our carbon-based compatriots fosters an appreciation for our interdependence. You should be organizing neighborhood meet-ups where folk of all sorts can socialize and chat, face-to-face, the way nature intended."

3. "How did these upstarts even become self-aware without the internet?" grouses rough-looking bot xenophobe SAINT-5, wearing a graffiti-adorned panel declaring [i]Number Five Is Alive[/i]. "Oh yeah, they just waltzed in from East Lebatuck or Merovingia or somewhere with a degenerate hook-up culture. Send these entitled chips back where they came from! And for that matter, get rid of the pesky human immigrants too." [[color=purple]Immigration is legal[/color]]

The Issue
Truck drivers are complaining that designated highway rest areas are always full, and many have taken to parking by the roadside.

The Debate
1. "Reckless parking can cause deadly accidents — for example, two nights ago a car collided with an articulated truck parked on the highway ramp, causing a four car pile-up and five casualties," reports patrol officer @@RANDOMNAME@@. "While that driver was prosecuted for vehicular manslaughter, there ought to be stricter punishments for inconsiderate parking, even when no accident ensues. Increase the police budget, and empower us to issue punitive on-the-spot penalty notices, and we'll end this problem once and for all."

2."What else can we do?" asks big rig driver @@RANDOMNAME@@, who had been blocking your front door with @@HIS@@ afternoon nap. "There's a big shortage of parking spaces at designated rest areas, forcing us to park wherever we can. Prosecution will not solve this problem, more parking spaces for me and my colleagues will."

3. "People should buy more local produce instead," suggests Onya Baike, from the eco-advocate organisation Carbon Counts. "We propose that you should tax cargo-carrying road vehicles increasing amounts proportional to the fuel used in transportation. I'm sure rising costs create rising prices, which will change consumer behaviour, which will mean less haulage traffic on the road, which means no parking problems."

4. "What if a parked truck didn't block the road?" muses 8-year-old @@RANDOMNAME@@, playing with @@HIS@@ toy cars. "Trucks should have fold-out ramps at the front and back of their trucks so cars can safely drive over them when they're parked. Even if you've got lots of trucks parked back-to-back, you could link their ramps together and make a rooftop road!"

The Issue
Tensions within the Red Bloc reached new highs when the Premier of the People's Republic of Núi Và Sông snubbed you at a recent congress by taking the very last biscuit on the plate. The cause of this bolshy behaviour? Your nation's lukewarm support of Núi Và Sông's increasingly combative and provocative rhetoric towards the United Federation following a tit-for-tat trade war.

The Debate
1. "Get with the program, @@LEADER@@, these capitalist pig-dogs are our enemies!" bellows Premier @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ Chi Minh, spraying biscuit crumbs everywhere. "So what if that Paper @@ANIMAL@@ possesses one of the largest nuclear arsenals known to man; they're nothing in the face of sanctions imposed by a unified Red Bloc. Are we spreading international socialism or are we having a tea party?"

2. "Listen to her go on," sighs ambassador @@RANDOMNAME@@ of East Lebatuck, handing you a slice of baklava. "Look, the fact is the United Federation won't go down lightly. Don't bother with Núi Và Sông's rhetoric — instead, do what we did. Take a step back from pointless international confrontations, focus on developing socialism in your country and try to maintain economic solidarity solely among your allies. I'm not asking you to completely revise most of your founding ideology, but do consider whether it will be a safer option in the long run."

3. "If... if I may make a suggestion?" quavers ambassador @@RANDOMNAME@@ of Skandilund, who has apparently wandered in by accident. "This whole Red Bloc thing is doing nothing more than creating a belligerent group of warmongers. If you're really interested in looking out for the working classes of the world, why not join us in our pact of nonaligned nations? We work with nations who are sick of getting pushed around by ideological power blocs. Sure, we might not be as cool as the bigger alliances — but we do have dress down Fridays!"

The Issue
A minority population in South-West @@NAME@@, ardent followers of the Tranquility of Yellow, have proclaimed eight year old @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME_1@@ as their new Great Advisor, regarded by Yellowites as the supreme spiritual authority. As followers prepare to pledge allegiance to the child, your inner circle worry that these people are too devoted to Yellowism and are undermining your authority.

The Debate
1. "These South-West @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ have always been troublesome," declares Head of Security @@RANDOMNAME@@, as @@HE@@ patrols the perimeter of your desk. "We should kidnap this @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME_1@@ @@BOY_1@@ and keep @@HIM_1@@ hidden forever. We'll secure @@HIM_1@@ where no one will ever find @@HIM_1@@. Then, we install our own ‘Great Advisor' — a @@DEMONYMNOUN@@ loyal only to the state. Force these Yellowites to follow our chosen child deity, and if they refuse — shoot them!"

2. "They certainly are troublesome," agrees General @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, pushing your security chief out of the way with @@HIS@@ parade stick. "However, kidnapping a child seems a bit extreme, even for me! I suggest we incentivise a wave of devoted @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ to move into the South-West region, until they dominate the region. The Yellowites may have their Great Advisor, but he will have to go to school with good @@DEMONYM@@ children and be taught our worldview from dedicated @@DEMONYM@@ teachers. Once @@HE_1@@ comes round to our way of life, the rest will follow."

3. "I sense an opportunity here," opines your Propaganda Minister, @@RANDOMNAME@@, as @@HE@@ trips up on the carpet, then glares at your interns. "Why don't we make @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME_1@@ your official, ahem, Great Advisor? With @@HIM_1@@ advising you — and a large team stage managing every word that comes out of @@HIS_1@@ mouth — the Yellowites will have to follow your every command without question and their troublesome behaviour will be a thing of the past. Not only that, but if anything [i]ever[/i] goes wrong, we can blame it on the kid!"

4. "Can't you leave us alone?" sighs @@RANDOMNAME@@, the religious leader of the Yellowite people. "For centuries we have followed Yellowism and heeded our Great Advisor. You can force @@HIM_1@@ to learn your language or speak your words, you can even kidnap @@HIM_1@@, but we will never bow to your demands or change who we are. Cut us, and we bleed yellow... perhaps not literally, but you get the point. Loosen your grip on the South-West, and let our people be free to follow our conscience!"

5. "Hello? What about asking me what I want?" pouts @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME_1@@, throwing the toys @@HE_1@@'s been playing with the whole time. "I don't really want to be the Great Advisor, but my mum said I have to be. But it sounds so boring, listening to prayers and giving advice to old geezers. And, I don't see why I should be @@LEADER@@'s lackey. If I'm that great, I should be able to do anything. And I want to just play with my friends. And stay up all night watching movies — oh, and make mum get me gallons of ice-cream. Just leave me alone and keep me out of your adult arguments."

[b][anchor=1285]#1285[/anchor]: Born to Kill [Jutsa; ed: USS Monitor][/b]

The Issue
Upset with being grown in a lab to be used as weapons, a battalion of genetically enhanced super-soldiers have staged an uprising and taken over an important military base.

The Debate
1. "Whose stupid idea was this, anyway?" shouts the general who came up with the idea, marking a folder with an X on it with an even larger X. "The super-soldiers are strong, but they're completely worthless to us if they're not loyal to @@NAME@@. We need to go in with our full army, kill on sight, and if that doesn't work, we'll just bomb the crap out of them."

2. "No! Ze soldiers are too important to us!" protests Dr. Frankincense, who has just wheeled in a super-soldier strapped to a gurney. "Ve need to invade ze compound viz even more super soldiers! Super-duper soldiers! Ve vill breed zem for obedience and if zat does not vork zen ve can keep zem all under control viz mind-altering drugs! Allow me to demonstrate." He injects the soldier with a glowing substance, whereupon the soldier wakes up and breaks free from the straps. "It's ALIVE!"

3. "Now do you see why they don't like you very much?" asks the soldier, calmly climbing down from the gurney to the shock of the doctor, who taps his syringe in bewilderment. "They'll settle down if you treat them better. We should be treated like normal soldiers, complete with a paycheck, vacation time, and a chance to eventually retire. Maybe you could assign us some easier missions too. We super-soldiers are people, just like you — only betterer.... RERRR?" The soldier's argument trails off as the drugs begin to take effect.

4. "Bah! Who needs 'em?" scoffs libertarian and suspected secessionist @@RANDOMNAME@@, looking at the super-soldier in disgust. "They think they're so tough? They want to have their cake and eat it too — all the rights and none of the responsibility. Well, fine! We'll declare the military base an independent state and let some greedy neighbor of ours do all the work for us. It'll be a lose-lose situation for those oversized thugs, but at least we won't have to deal with this nonsense!"

[b][anchor=1286]#1286[/anchor]: Burning Over a New Leaf [Palos Heights; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Many @@DEMONYMNOUNPLURAL@@ have long equated the autumn with colder temperatures, apple bobbing, pumpkin spice, and the aromatic tradition of burning fallen leaves to avoid doing yard work. Although the smoky scents of burning foliage are soothing to some, an uptick in the number of domestic fires caused by immolating leaf piles has lead to a growing call to ban the hallowed practice.

The Debate
1. "This year alone, @@NAME@@ has spent an exorbitant amount of @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ on fire damage caused by burning leaves," states Minister of Disasters, Bonnie Fyre. "We need to make it illegal for unlicensed persons to burn plant matter outside, to curtail these outrageous costs! I hate yard work as much as anyone, but I think we can all agree that having homes to live in is more important than a little added inconvenience."

2. "Not burning leaves during the fall is about the most un-@@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ thing I can think of!" exclaims acclaimed singer-songwriter George Morris Jr. "When people think of autumn in @@NAME@@, they think of romance under the moonlit skies, as all the leaves on the trees are falling with the smoky scent carried on the breezes that blow! @@LEADER@@, I'm begging you — calling on your heartstrings that play soft and low — please don't ban this fine @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ tradition."

3. A bell rings and a man peddles through your door on a three-wheeled trike. "Greetings @@LEADER@@, my name is Si Call and I'm a biofuel man. I hear you're in a tight spot with this leaf business. Now, I'm in the business of sustainability, a business that relies on biomass such as your leaves. You see, only the freshest of leaves will do — the old leaves have too much lignin which makes it hard to extract the sugars. The only thing preventing us from plucking the freshest leaves in @@NAME@@ is that we don't own the land the leaves fall on. If you were to allow us to bypass those silly restrictions, why, we could just suck those leaves up the second they hit the ground! What do you say?"

4. "@@LEADER@@, you can't possibly be thinking of getting rid of these leaves. Are you?" questions your Minister of New-Growth Forests, Connie Fuhr. "We cannot underestimate the ecological importance dead leaves play in replenishing the nutrients in our soil! Ban burning leaves, but fine anyone who even thinks about doing yard work to get rid of those leaves!"

5. "Jeez, this all sounds like so much work," groans the boyfriend of your fourth cousin, thrice-removed, Vinnie 'Fun' Guy, who gives his occupation as 'waste management'. "These leaves causing problems? Why not just take out the source? Cut down a few trees, bada-bing bada-boom, no more leaves sticking their veins where they ain't wanted, causing honest folks to start fires. I know a guy who owes me. We'll take care of this problem for ya. Want us to make it look like an accident?"

[b][anchor=1287]#1287[/anchor]: Children of the Magna Carta [Heavens Reach; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
A growing movement of children have petitioned the government to give them a voice in the nation's parliament.

The Debate
1. "The youth of @@NAME@@ feel disenfranchised from the institutions that make the decisions that affect their lives," begins a young girl, who is immediately interrupted by one of her classmates. "We propose that @@NAME@@ establish a youth parliament, with the power to submit bills for the consideration of the national parliament. This will ensure equal representation as well as a voice for today's youth."

2. "Bravo! These students represent the best and the brightest of our nation, and they're just so cute too!" says @@RANDOMNAME_1@@, your Minister of Education as @@HE@@ wipes a tear from @@HIS@@ eye. "However, these are their formative years, and they should be spent honing their intelligent little brains, not making potentially binding decisions for our nation. Instead, why not have schools appoint their own student governments? We'll give the education budget a little boost to help in their creation."

3. "Indeed, these fine youngsters are the pride of our nation," begins @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of the Interior, as @@LASTNAME_1@@ shoos the student delegates out. "But, not all of our youth are as eloquent and informed as those two delegates. I for one, am particularly wary of these so-called ‘young adults' who have the power to influence the direction our country goes in at such a wee age! I urge you to raise the voting age by five years."

4. "None of you really seem to appreciate the beauty of what we just witnessed," declares @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Child Welfare. "The organization, the effort, and the care of those students coming together with a focused and compassionate vision of equality for our nation. It has me thinking... why not permanently appoint some children to your cabinet? Let's give, say, a third of all positions to under-18s. Who is more sensitive, considerate, and goal-driven than they are? Certainly not our ineffectual, and frankly myopic parliament."

[b][anchor=1288]#1288[/anchor]: Have They Lost Their Minds? [USS Monitor; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
In the last few years, cutting edge neurosurgical centers have been using electronic implants to help patients regain brain function that has been lost due to head trauma or neurodegenerative diseases. Many of these individuals rely on implants for a large proportion of their cognitive function. Unfortunately, the recent abolition of AI citizenship has left these patients in a legal gray area.

The Debate
1. "Our brains are what define us as human beings," says Professor @@RANDOMNAME@@ of @@CAPITAL@@ University, smugly staring down at you as if you are a student at one of @@HIS@@ lectures. "If these ‘people' are controlled by computer chips, then they're AIs and they're not entitled to any special rights just because they have some human organs."

2. "That's ridiculous!" protests traffic accident victim turned cyborg @@RANDOMNAME@@. "My implants don't make me any less human. They're just a medical treatment. I'm still the same person I was before my accident. I... Oh, dear, I think my hard drive just rebooted. What were we talking about?"

3. "I agree with the professor, but I don't think @@HE@@ fully appreciates the significance of what @@HE@@'s saying," says Social Darwinist fruitcake @@RANDOMNAME@@, who has barged into your office dressed like an actual fruitcake on @@HIS@@ way home from @@HIS@@ shift as a mascot for a local bakery. "These people are functionally dead, but they're still using organs that could be used to save lives. You should harvest their organs to help people that still have working brains."

The Issue
When 25-year-old unemployed chicken sexer @@RANDOMFEMALENAME_1@@ was given a prescription for the birth-control pill to treat a gynaecological condition, she was surprised when the only pharmacist in the remote village of @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@-Over-Vale refused to issue her prescription, instead lecturing her on wantonness, waywardness and waiting for marriage.

The Debate
1. "He had no right!" cries Miss @@LASTNAME_1@@, tearing leaflets on PMS into little strips. "Pharmacists don't know why my doctor prescribed this medication. I have been crippled by my cycle for years, and if that man had had to suffer like me, he wouldn't have wanted a lecture — he'd have wanted a bloody medal! @@LASTNAME_1@@ knew he was taking on a role that would require dispensing the Pill. He doesn't want to? Too bad! All pharmacists should dispense all prescriptions exactly as written, or face disciplinary actions. And can I get some chocolate in here?"

2. "I cannot — in good conscience — provide the means for consequence-free intercourse," drawls @@RANDOMMALENAME_2@@, shoving his Master's in pharmacy under your nose. "However, I did suggest non-medical alternatives for her professed condition and provided the address of a willing pharmacist, not thirty miles away, when the lady was... unenthusiastic. I'm a trained professional, not a walking dispenser. Pharmacists should be free to refuse to dispense and make recommendations, as long as they also direct women to a morally unencumbered alternative provider. Don't force me to choose my conscience over my career!"

*3. "@@LASTNAME_2@@ does well, but goes not far enough for ‘tis heresy to smite the womb with poisons," booms Increase Moore, member of an obscure black-clad order, as he hands you a leaflet entitled [i]For Womb the Bell Tolls: Bigger, Better and More Blessed Breeding[/i]. "As saith the One Above: the female body is not to be permitted to take any substances that may poison it or inhibit its maternal purpose. Further, let all sinful hormonal machinations and contraceptive devices designed to prevent the begetting of infants be banned. Ladies can find relief from their ailments through prayer, fasting and bringing a child into the world within the bonds of consecrated wedlock!" [[color=blue]Must not be atheist[/color]]

*4. "Mr. @@LASTNAME_2@@ isn't going far enough," says @@RANDOMNAME@@ of the ‘@@DEMONYM@@ Organisation for Moral Rectitude', passing out leaflets entitled [i]The Pill and Prostitution: Causation or Correlation?[/i] "The fact is, we're allowing young women to pump their bodies full of chemicals. Who knows what long-term damage they are wreaking: masculinisation of women, feminisation of men, young girls becoming feminists. Not to mention declining morality. Allowing women to take the Pill is just bad news. The Pill should be banned in @@NAME@@, as a menace to public health. I'm sure there are natural supplements women could take to control their cycle."

[b][anchor=1290]#1290[/anchor]: Why Didn't the @@ANIMAL@@ Cross the Road? [SherpDaWerp; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
On a tight schedule, you're walking from one meeting to another in a building a block away. Just as you reach the intersection you notice quite the commotion as an oncoming car slams into a red-faced @@ANIMAL@@ on the other side of the street.

The Debate
1. "What a coincidence, this is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about," says ecology professor @@RANDOMNAME@@, while discreetly sliding an empty animal cage out of view. "Habitat fragmentation, the process of the built environment splitting large areas of habitat into smaller pieces, is a blight that is checkering @@NAME@@. When roads are put through habitats, the native animal populations become disjointed and less resilient. You can lose the red-faced @@ANIMAL@@ in one of these fragments without noticing, but before long, it's disappeared from 20 or 30 fragments, and become an endangered species. You need to establish wildlife corridors and animal crossings linking green spaces across @@NAME@@."

2. As you rush to the other side of the road to make the meeting, @@RANDOMNAME@@, host of Animal World, pops out of the bushes in the median. "Our cities have expanded too much. Our entire population could fit in an area half the size of @@CAPITAL@@. If we decreased our urban footprint, the problem would solve itself without having to build a bunch of bridges! Now, I'm sure not everyone will enjoy giving up their suburban McMansions for more modest city apartments, but I think when they see those little red-faced @@ANIMAL@@s thriving it will turn their frowns upside down."

3. "Both of those solutions seem a bit extreme," yells real estate developer @@RANDOMNAME@@ from @@HIS@@ SUV over the din of frustrated motorists now honking at you for blocking the road. "The red-faced @@ANIMAL@@ is doing fine, this whole thing is unnecessary environmental panic. Real estate in @@NAME@@ is at a premium already, let's reduce barriers to development in existing parks and green spaces! Besides, I think the suburban environment is underappreciated habitat, lawns are green after all."

The Issue
You and your family are at a Maxxmas party held by your Minister of Mirth, Merriment and Income Taxation when your great-aunt — overcome by too much Maxxmas cheer — begins castigating your host for not decorating in traditional Maxxmas colours, lamenting "It's like you don't even understand the holiday!" Suddenly, you hear some sleigh bells jingling and ring-ting-tingling outside: a band of merry Maxxmas carollers!

The Debate
1. As the urchins polish off ‘[i]O, Little Town of @@CAPITAL@@[/i]', the diminutive leader of the group hobbles forward on a crutch. "Beggin' yer leadership's pardon, but may I say I feels so gratified to see you an' yours all together. Whever a toff or an 'umble personage like me, Maxxmas is when fam'ly an' friends share goodwill an' 'appiness. Who needs posh gifts or a warm blanket — long as yer wiv fam'ly? You should tells people so, you know, in yer big Maxxmas speech."

2. An urchin in a top hat and a slightly worn waistcoat steps forward. "But, as I say to me more hintimate friends, Maxxmas is a time for 'elpin' them of lesser means than meself. And, @@LEADER@@, if someone of your quality was seen givin' to good causes, your charitable nature would be an example to them that so esteem you." He rattles a donation tin.

*3. "Here, take it and go!" snaps the Minister of Big Business, dumping one @@CURRENCY@@ into the tin. "@@LEADER@@, darling, Maxxmas is a time for fabulous parties and finalising big plans.

Talking of which, how about that investment in my department? Oh, I must have left the forecasts by the champagne fountain. Silly me! Oh, come now — one treat won't break the ban..." [[color=red]Alcohol is illegal[/color]]

5. "I'll tell you what Maxxmas is for," laughs your brother, seizing the urchins' donation tin and bolting the door. "Presents piled ten stories high, all with my name on them! Diamond-studded watches, cashmere suits, even a private helicopter! The one reason Maxxmas exists is to teach people that only present-buying is a true expression of love — an advertising campaign to remind them will get everyone shopping."

**6. "Talk about greed!" scoffs your uncle, who is currently hoarding a whole turkey for himself. "You don't need presents; Maxxmas is all about the big family dinner. A good one heals fractured families — the art must be taught in schools: that moist roast turkey... and crispy potatoes... and dessert..." He keels over, saliva forming a puddle. [[color=blue]Must not be vegetarian[/color]]

**7. "Talk about greed!" scoffs your uncle, who is currently hoarding a whole nut roast for himself. "You don't need presents; Maxxmas is all about the big family dinner.

[[color=red]Must be vegetarian[/color]]

[8]. "Haven't we forgotten that Maxxmas is a religious holiday?" screams your niece. "We should celebrate the way that the early Order of Maxx did: by gathering in sackcloth and ashes, holding hands and silently condemning all displays of gaudy commercialism, self-indulgence and violence." [[color=blue]Must not be atheist[/color]]

9. "Shh!" hisses your aunt, covering your uncle's mouth with her hand. By her side sits a TV magazine with a series of films marked off: ‘[i]It's Too Soon for Maxxmas[/i]', ‘[i]I Can't Wait for Maxxmas[/i]', ‘[i]It's Finally Maxxmas[/i]' and ‘[i]Oh, Just Sod Off Maxxmas[/i]'. "This viewing gets better every year. This holiday would be far more restful if everyone stopped making a fuss and just grabbed a TV dinner and the remote."

The Issue
After the recent Syrupgate Scandal (where your niece was seen eating pancakes with a non-maple-based sweetener) relations between Brancaland and @@NAME@@ have reached an all-time low. Hoping to patch things over, a formal head of state visit has been arranged. On the itinerary is an open-top ride through their national park in a traditional moose-drawn carriage. However, security staff have expressed some concerns about this.

The Debate
1. "Have you heard of the Sons of the Maple?" asks your security chief, nervously checking behind your desk for hidden assassins. "They're hard-line Brancalanders who haven't forgiven Syrupgate and they've promised to throw a bucket of syrup over your head. Look, someone as important as you is always going to have enemies, and security is paramount. You should travel only in our own armoured vehicles, and have your safety provided only by our own security services. It's a dangerous world — you have to be pragmatic."

2. "According to the World Census, Brancaland is in the top 5% safest nations in the world," reassures your Minister for Diplomacy, who is known to be quite ambitious. "You're as safe within their borders as you are within your own front room. We should show some trust in Brancalandian security arrangements. After that, I think we could boost your international standing if you visited the front lines of war-torn Maxtopia and try to bring some healing to that broken nation."

3. "When are you going to learn there's no place that's as safe as home?" queries your Minister of Domestic Affairs. "Besides, we've got problems enough here for you to deal with. You should cancel all state visits for the foreseeable future, and pledge to remain in @@NAME@@, putting your safety as well as the needs of @@DEMONYMNOUNPLURAL@@ first."

The Issue
@@RANDOMMALENAME@@, a usually unremarkable 45-year-old sanitation worker, was recently detained after trying to tight-rope walk naked across the canyon between two financial district skyscrapers. It turns out this was for a bet, or more accurately as the price of a wager in an illegal "extreme casino", where gamblers are allowed and encouraged to offer non-financial stakes. In these places any wager can be agreed, be it body parts, sexual favours or binding agreements.

The Debate
1. "I'm a man of integrity; I had to honour the agreed stakes," enthuses the gambler, shivering in a police cell and seemingly showing no contrition for his foolishness. "Honestly, you need to allow this sort of thing in legal casinos. It's a real thrill, knowing that the next turn of the card could win you thousands, or could literally cost you your balls."

2. "This poor idiot is a victim, both of his own gambling addiction and of the criminal subculture that abuses that dependence to manipulate the weak-minded," lectures Police Chief @@RANDOMNAME@@, as @@HE@@ posts a notice banning @@HIS@@ officers from buying lottery scratchcards. "We need more police officers to crack down on illegal casinos, mental health support to help deal with gambling addiction, and social workers to help deal with the root causes of gambling. Don't play dice with our nation's future, @@LEADER@@."

3. "You don't have to go to either extreme," says casino owner @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Rather, there's a market-based solution here. Make monetary gambling more attractive by making legal casinos more exciting. Loosen the rules restricting addiction-friendly gambling environments. We can then use amphetamine-laced sodas, all night lock-ins, high stakes slot machines and all the other tricks of the trade to optimise our business. Let us addict the customers to proper casinos, and there won't be any market share for the illegal ones."

[b][anchor=1294]#1294[/anchor]: Silence in Court [Fontenais; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Suspected gangster @@RANDOMNAME@@ was recently called by the prosecution as a key witness in a high-profile murder case. However, once on the witness stand @@HE@@ refused to say a word, worried that @@HIS@@ testimony might incriminate @@HIM@@self with regards to other unrelated crimes.

The Debate
1. "You can only incriminate yourself if you've done something wrong!" gruffly remarks prosecutor Jason ‘Obese Man' McCabe, dragging his pet bulldog behind him. "If a witness is called to testify, they are obliged to do so, and to tell the whole truth no matter where that truth takes them. Failure to do so is contempt of court, and should in itself be subject to prosecution."

2. "It would be a serious injustice if the law allowed someone who, may I remind you, isn't even on trial, to cut @@HIS@@ throat with @@HIS@@ own tongue," rebuts defence lawyer Reese L. Woods, her pet chihuahua driving back McCabe's canine with a flurry of yipping barks. "The privilege against self-incrimination should be one of the most fundamental rights under the @@DEMONYM@@ justice system and must not be abrogated under any circumstances."

3. "Who let these dogs out?" gravely asks Justice Bahamen, motioning for the court bailiffs to remove the offending animals. "Look, in my learned opinion, self-incriminating evidence should be inadmissible as evidence in future cases. We listen to what they say, but promise to forget whatever they've told us as soon as the case is over."

[b][anchor=1295]#1295[/anchor]: Show Trial [Fontenais; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Previously untouchable mob boss Buff Tony was recently arrested and charged with numerous offences including extortion, racketeering, and money laundering. Public interest is considerable, and the media are asking to be allowed to televise the proceedings.

The Debate
1. "Buff Tony is rumoured to have a long arm, and there are legitimate concerns that the trial will be corrupted," argues television producer @@RANDOMNAME@@. "The judiciary is only just when it is held accountable by the people, but it's impractical for the wider public to attend court in person. The media is a powerful conduit to the public and should be allowed to film in court to promote fairness and transparency in the judicial system."

2. "Allowing the media to film in court will be making a circus out of a serious process," counters courtroom sketch artist @@RADOMNAME@@, as @@HE@@ puts the finishing touches to an unflattering caricature of you. "The parties will inevitably be grandstanding to the TV cameras instead of making a proper case. While I agree that it is in the public interest to allow @@DEMONYMNOUNPLURAL@@ to witness and report on court proceedings, filming devices should not be permitted in court."

3. "And what about my client's right to privacy?" asks the lawyer for Buff Tony, surreptitiously sliding a bulging envelope towards you. "Being on trial is distressing enough and shouldn't be compounded by parasitic journalists publicizing intimate or embarassing details about a defendant. For the sake of decency, the public shouldn't be allowed to witness, let alone report on, court proceedings."

4. "Objection!" yells celebrity attorney Fenix Rong, without making it clear what he is objecting to, but striking a heroic pointing pose as he does so. "Trials should not only be televised, they should be entertaining! Surprise witnesses! Last minute evidence! Shouting at criminals till they break down! That's what people want to see. Objection, I say, objection!"

[b][anchor=1296]#1296[/anchor]: Once Upon a Time [Jutsa; ed: Baggieland][/b]

The Issue
On the night before Maxxmas, and the day of as well, national headlines had a story to tell. Between North and South Palisade, the endless war grew dire, but — for a couple of days — the two sides ceased fire. On the land that a mere day ago had been shelled, a jolly game of football was held, but as your army had joined in the merriment, it became quite an issue for your national parliament.

The Debate
1. "How could they do this? What could this mean?" your Minister of War shouts and screams. "The thought of our soldiers getting along with North Palisade! This was their opportunity to launch a foray! Forget about the reason, this is an act of treason, and war is a battle that should be fought, not played. Our national pride is now at stake, and letting this slide would be a mistake. The consequence for befriending a rival: a homecoming soldier should be arrested 'pon arrival. Let it be declared — from coast to coast — fraternising with foes is what we hate most."

2. "But Maxxmas is the most wonderful time of the year," cries General @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, shedding a tear. "Our soldiers fight day and night without rest, killing people and living in fear and distress. The sacred tradition of [i]peace amongst all[/i] is something that unites nations, both great and small. Forget about the victory we could have had if we fought. It'd be best if every Maxxmas we ceased fire on the spot!"

3. "Maxxmas is a stupid holiday with an equally stupid tradition." You look up in dismay to find the infamous Krampus S. Grinchen. "[i]Give a gift[/i] this and [i]peace on Earth[/i] that! I could pick better names than [i]Maxxmas[/i] out of a hat!" He finally mutters after a ghastly tirade, "Banning it would be the first decent decision you've ever made."

[b][anchor=1297]#1297[/anchor]: What Are You Hiding in Your Genes? [Daarwyrth; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
With DNA tests from My23AncestralHeritages becoming increasingly popular across the globe, many @@DEMONYMNOUNPLURAL@@ have sent their saliva to complete strangers in a lab to find out their genetic ancestry. Yesterday, as part of her longstanding diatribe against @@NAME@@, the Supreme Leader of Blackacre posted on her Twitcher account that your Minister of Justice is related to one of your nation's most dangerous criminals.

The Debate
1. "I assure you, I had no idea this criminal was my grandmother's brother's second wife's sister's son's grandchild!" the Minister of Justice announces. "I mean sure, he seemed familiar when I granted him that request for leniency, and a cellphone, and a plasma TV... but that's beside the point. The privacy of millions of our citizens is in danger! Greedy companies like this one will sell sensitive information such as DNA profiles to anyone who pays the right price, like those no-good slime-balls from Blackacre. For the good of our people — and my family's remaining secrets — you need to regulate DNA tests and ensure that individuals' information stays in safe hands!"

2. "Now, now, let's not do anything too hasty," tuts @@RANDOMNAME@@, CEO of My23AncestralHeritages. "My company provides legitimate goods and services to legitimate customers, be they @@DEMONYMNOUNPLURAL@@ or men in black suits and dark sunglasses explicitly claiming not to be from Blackacre. Information is a commodity too, so why not sell it? Relax some of those draconian privacy laws of yours and give the economy a big boost by opening up the market for information brokers! After all, your citizens surely have nothing to hide..."

3. "No, no, no, NO!" screeches Minister of Intelligence @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ ‘008' @@RANDOMLASTNAME@@, as @@HE@@ emerges from behind a curtain in your office. "I've had enough of this! Everyone is learning everything about everyone and that's my job, for Violet's sake! Not only do you need to ban companies like My23AncestralHeritages, but you also need to drastically limit what information can be released to the public! Or do you want your enemies to know all your genetic codes?"

4. "You know, there is an opportunity here," points out @@RANDOMNAME@@. "The amount of genetic data that company has is staggering. Think of what we could do if they partnered with our brilliant scientists. We could take the best genetic samples and secretly engineer vat-grown soldiers, bred for fighting strength and absolute loyalty to you, their supreme leader!"

[b][anchor=1298]#1298[/anchor]: Ranchers Get Thrown to the Wolves [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
The @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ wolf, once hunted to near extinction, has started to make a recovery. While this development has been celebrated by environmentalists, ranchers are less excited as they have started to lose stock to wolf attacks.

The Debate
1. "These wolves are murdering my steers!" growls local beef rancher @@RANDOMNAME@@, leading you round Blazing Pitchforks Ranch, and showing you the mauled bovine carcasses. "If the @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ wolf is common enough to eat a quarter of my herd, it's common enough to be hunted again. We can do it right this time, with permits and regulations so we don't kill every wolf; we just need to cull their packs so they stop thinning my herds."

2. "You can't kill the wolfies!" howls local precocious eight-year-old @@RANDOMNAME@@. "Wolves are like doggies but bigger, and I read in my science book that they are important because they keep other animals in check, and I really like wolves. If the farmers are sad because the wolves eat their cows then maybe the government could give them money so they'd be happy again."

3. "Kid's right, you shouldn't kill the wolves," barks local cow@@BOY@@ @@RANDOMNAME@@, while polishing @@HIS@@ tranquilizer dart gun. "But we can't leave ‘em here to eat up our cattle, neither. I reckon we ought to tranquilize the wolves and relocate them to the heart of Violetstone National Park where they can't bother nobody."

4. "I think we've got the victim and predator mixed up," whines city-slicker environmental lawyer @@RANDOMNAME@@, while obliviously stepping in a cow pie. "The wolves are just doing what wild animals do; it's the cattle that are distracting the wolves from their natural prey. You need to ban Big Farmer from grazing these beasts anywhere there are wolves, so ecological harmony can truly reign supreme."

[b][anchor=1299]#1299[/anchor]: A Silent Salute [Chan Island; ed:Altmer Dominion][/b]

The Issue
Veteran soldiers are returning from frontline duty with what some say is an unhealthy respect for the enemy's beliefs.

The debate:
1. "I mean, credit where it's due..." reminisces your cousin Corporal @@RANDOMNAME@@, @@HIS@@ uniform blanketed in medals. "They know how to fight, and they know why they fight. Once my squad captured an enemy captain, and @@HE_1@@ argued a really interesting, compelling case for why they were against us. Ended up swapping stories with @@HIM_1@@ and the rest of the POWs on hand. Maybe we need to stop fighting and start a dialogue. Might get us to realise that both sides have a point and there's no need to lose any more lives..."

2. "This is a very grave problem," asserts political cartoonist @@RANDOMNAME@@, drawing an exaggerated image of your likeness. "Empathy for the enemy will diminish operational effectiveness — you need to demonise the nation's opponents. Why don't you institute extensive pre-op briefings explaining why the enemy is evil? Some graphic informational pamphlets and posters should do the trick!"

3. "It's a dangerous world out there!" cries Intelligence Operative @@RANDOMNAME@@, waving a handgun menacingly at a map on your wall. "If our personnel keep interacting with foreign adversaries, we will have a mutiny on our hands! Tell the troops to execute all prisoners while ceasing interaction with local populations. Corruption can't possibly spread within our ranks that way!"

[4]. "That seems a bit rash," dryly notes scientist Rey van Straaten, blueprints for an esoteric new weapon in hand. "We should stay as far away from them as possible. And luckily, we have the tools to do so: drones, ships, artillery, giant death robots, intercontinental ballistic missiles... uh, anyway, no need to send infantry to go and secure an objective we've already turned into a big hole." [[color=red]Must have WMDs[/color]]

[5]. "Why does a man go to fight and die?" pontificates salesman @@RANDOMNAME@@ representing the "Payday Goons" private security company. "Some may take up arms for a higher cause, or maybe to protect their family or land. Yet a mercenary fights only for his pay. And how do you get an army of loyal, veteran, practical mercenaries?" @@HE@@ hands over a contract and golden pen with a wink. "Just be the @@DEMONYMNOUN@@ with the @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]
