[b][anchor=320]#320[/anchor]: Criminals to Vote? [Iglesian Archipelago; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
Following recent elections in @@NAME@@ where the Equality for Vilified Inmates League won a noticeable percentage of seats, the media have jumped on the issue of whether or not prisoners should be allowed to vote.

The Debate
1. "This is absurd!", argues conservative politician, @@RANDOM_NAME@@ "Why should criminals be allowed to participate in elections like normal people? Voting should be a privilege for the law-abiding members of this country. If someone breaks the law, they must lose the right to have a say in who governs them. At the very least it'll be a good deterrent."

2. "You're not going to listen to that clap-trap I hope", says noted liberal commentator @RANDOM_NAME@@. "Voting is a right that everyone should enjoy, regardless of whether or not they have committed a crime. We already punish those who break our law; restricting one's ability to vote is a punishment totally disproportionate to any crime!"

[b][anchor=321]#321[/anchor]: Cowboys and... Aliens? [Carlosianor; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
A gang of rough-riders has been policing towns along @@NAME@@'s border, rounding up illegal aliens and "escorting" them back home.

The Debate
1. "Who do these thugs think they are?" asks popular liberal blogger @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The police should be the only ones handling border control! If we leave it in the hands of wild frontiersmen, immigrants will be herded and probed like @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@! It's despicable, it's degrading, and it must be stopped!"

2. "Why, we just helpin' our community, is all," drawls the self-proclaimed sheriff of the cowboy gang, Harry Fjord, as he slides off his saddle to shake your hand. "Matta'fact, we're helpin' the gov'ment as well, enforcin' border control and keepin' yer towns safe from them damned illegals. I can handle m'boys, so don't you worry 'bout a thing."

[b][anchor=322]#322[/anchor]: Empathy a Rare Commodity? [The Cookish States; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
Last week, a jaywalking man was hit by a truck in a busy intersection. He lay there for seventeen hours before a policeman tripped over him and brought him to jail for loitering.

The Debate
1."This is despicable!" yelps one lone protester, desperately trying to get others involved. "How low have we sunk that we care so little for our fellow man? The answer is as plain as the nose on your face. You must create an Empathy Awareness Squad. They would train people on how to be kind to and empathize with one another. Sure, it'll require some extra taxes, but can you really put a price on kindness? I mean, what if YOU get hit by a truck next time?"

2."Good riddance!" scoffs @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a sullen, disgruntled postal worker. "I think we should give the policeman who arrested that freeloader a medal! Mandatory empathy programs? Ha! No amount of touchy-feely 'training' is gonna make me empathize with these idiots. This is just nature's way of weeding out the weak and infirm. In fact, we should cut what social spoon-feeding programs we've got left. Give your good and decent citizens a tax break."

[b][anchor=323]#323[/anchor]: Get Teens out of MyFace? [Malsitar; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
After the abduction of a young blond girl made national headlines in @@NAME@@, the concerned parenting organization Mothers Against Youth Doing Stupid Stuff (MAYDSS) has raised concerns over the use of social networking sites by the nation's teens.

The Debate
1."Teens should not be allowed to use social networking!" cries the girl's mother, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Some creep added my little darling as a 'friend' on that awful website, and he used it to get all of her personal information and track her down! Obviously, the only sane course of action is to ban all legal minors from using social networking sites! And don't just stop at social networks: block everything else that MAYDSS doesn't approve of!"

2."Why that's utterly preposterous!" shouts Marcus Sugarmountain, founder of MyFace, a popular social networking site. "You can't restrict people like that! Oh, sure, today it's keeping teens from lining my wa- I mean - accessing my website, but tomorrow it's keeping everyone from anywhere the government doesn't like! I say free up the web, and get rid of restrictions!"

3. "You know, there's always a compromise," says local birdwatcher @@RANDOM_NAME@@ peering at you from a nearby tree. "As I see it, the best way to keep both sides of the argument happy is to remove all restrictions on what adults can view and increase restrictions on minors. But at the same time, lower the age of majority by a lot. What could possibly go wrong?"

4."What could possibly go wrong, you ask?" panics your paranoid cousin, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "On the internet, nobody knows your actual age. It's a haven for malicious anonymity! Besides, children aren't the only people at risk on the internet. It's full of stalker-rapists and bomb-makers and viruses and sick, depraved porn. We're better off without it."

[b][anchor=324]#324[/anchor]: "Tourism Tanking!" Trumpet Tabloids [Panageadom; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Following a public safety disaster of unimaginable magnitude - so extreme that members of your government only mention it in hushed voices, and then only in the vaguest of terms - the @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ tourist industry has hit the rocks. Commentators from all walks of life have come to your office to offer their opinions.

The Debate
1."The government has to step in and do something, for once!" demands tour operator @@RANDOM_NAME@@, visibly pulling her hair out. "If we'd had proper railings on the marina, that shark would never have gotten into the oil refinery in the first place! The government has to put better regulations in place to make sure disasters of this kind never happen again. And if we want to coax back the tourists we've lost, we need a whole bunch of new state-subsidised hotels, parks and tourist attractions. Shark-proof ones. Our economy will never survive without it!"

*2."Why waste more money?" grumbles middle-aged industrialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chomping on a fat cigar, "Look. I'm as sorry as the next schmuck for those poor farmers' ant epidemic. But we've got to realise that tourism is just not @@NAME@@'s strong suit; and that's not going to change, no matter how much the state spends. Hell, if the government really wanted to do something to fix our economy, it'd be to give everyone a healthy tax-cut and get rid of some of that environmental legislation - set up for the benefit of a bunch of tree-hugging foreigners, I might add." [[color=blue]Smoking is legal[/color]]

*3. "Why waste more money?" grumbles middle-aged industrialist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, chewing on a thick wad of qat. "Look. I'm as sorry as the next schmuck for those poor farmers' ant epidemic. But we've got to realise that tourism is just not @@NAME@@'s strong suit; and that's not going to change, no matter how much the state spends.

[[color=red]Smoking is illegal[/color]]

4."I think I've got another solution to this problem," says your shadiest government advisor, waving a magazine spread of bathing beauties sunning themselves at the @@CAPITAL@@ Grand Regent. "Now we're not goin' to be able to hide the fact that @@NAME@@ is now covered in pink frosting, but... what if the inspectors an' tour guides an' all those types of folks just didn't notice all that mess? After all, we don't have the money to clear it all up, but I think we do have just about enough to dangle a few @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ in front of anyone who wants to give our nation a good review. After all, a few firm golden handshakes never hurt no-one."

[b][anchor=325]#325[/anchor]: Blazing Through the Paper Trail [Euphilium; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
Following a recent fire in the National Archive, which destroyed thousands of important documents, several vocal representatives have approached you with solutions.

The Debate
1. "We've got to face facts: technology has advanced beyond physical record-keeping," councils @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the PR representative for Eastern Electronic. "Digital records are easier to maintain and easier to back up. Our company can facilitate the switch from the archaic paper records to the sleek, new electronic system. There is the slight risk of electronic tampering, but our security systems are more than capable."

*2. "Now, hold on a second. What about us?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the CEO of a national paper supplier. "We might not have the flash of an electronic system, but I'll tell you what we do have: quality customer service. You're saying fires are bad. Well, we hear you loud and clear. Stick with us and not only will we make physical copies of all the files to store in different locales, but I'll get my research team to whip up some fire-resistant paper too. Let's see those IT poindexters do all that!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "Now, hold on a second. What about us?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, State Director of the People's Paper Mills. "We might not have the flash of an electronic system, but I'll tell you what we do have: a trained and eager workforce. You're saying fires are bad. Well, we hear you loud and clear. Stick with us and not only will we make physical copies of all the files to store in different locales, but I'll get my research team to whip up some fire-resistant paper too. Let's see those IT poindexters do all that!" [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "No, no, no. It's all too dangerous!" screams @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dressed only in a cured @@ANIMAL@@ hide. "Paper can be destroyed by fire or floods, and electronic copies are susceptible to viruses and hackers! There's only one way to truly keep our records safe. We must rerecord them on stone tablets. Fire can't destroy them, and I'd like to see someone hack a piece of granite!"

[b][anchor=326]#326[/anchor]: Knitters In A Knot Over Police Stitch Up [Tsaraine; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
After a peaceful public knitting class was dispersed by riot police, the citizenry are up in arms at what they perceive as unnecessary police brutality.

The Debate
1."With all due respect, @@LEADER@@, you weren't there, so you don't know the full story", your police chief states candidly. "These thugs were loitering in @@ANIMAL@@ Park brandishing weapons! They were up to something - mark my words! Besides, if it wasn't for our brave police officers, who knows what kind of damage they could have caused. We've got to come down hard on thugs like these and ban groups comprising of three or more people. That'll stop any troublemaking, I'm sure of it!"

2."Weapons? WEAPONS? They were knitting needles you imbecile!" shouts @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, the elderly President of the Polluted Slavery Knitting League, brandishing a pair of pins in the direction of the police chief. "The only thugs in @@ANIMAL@@ Park that day were the riot police - protectors of public safety my royal rump! They fired rubber bullets at us without any warning. Rubber bullets! And I only out of the hospital after getting my hip replacement. You MUST do something about these trigger-happy hooligans. Clearly if they can't tell the difference between criminals and geriatrics they need retraining!"

3."Retraining the entire police force would cost far too much", your financial advisor says quietly, appearing from behind your chair. "That being said, the crazy lady with the woolly hat is right, we do have to do something about this situation. We can't have the police force appear brutal and unruly. What we should do is ban all sorts of dangerous weapons. That way the police force won't have to worry about dangerous thugs with guns, and the public can rest easy knowing the police force won't be able to brutally attack them either. And we can get rid of the riot police too as they clearly won't be needed, which saves us money! Everybody wins!"

[b][anchor=327]#327[/anchor]: No Rest For The Weary @@ANIMAL@@ [Black and Brindle; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
With the popularity of @@ANIMAL@@ racing in @@NAME@@ booming, the growing number of retired racing @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ being abandoned on the streets has become harder to ignore. As irresistibly cute pictures of sad-looking @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ fill up the pages of newspapers, the time has come for government action.

The Debate
1. "We're overflowing with @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ here!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of the Sunrise @@ANIMAL@@ Retirement Lodge. "And we just don't get enough donations from the public to house them all. We're now facing a choice between turning away @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@, or putting them down. It's the @@ANIMAL@@ racing industry's fault we're in this situation - make them pay for homing the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ they cast off."

2. "Not far enough!" declares animal-rights protestor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, wearing a @@ANIMAL@@ costume to show her sympathy for their plight. "There's only one reason that @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ get abandoned in the first place, and that reason is @@ANIMAL@@ racing. These poor creatures get cooped up in a cage all day and are virtually starved so they race well, all to line the pockets of some avaricious gambling bosses. The solution is obvious - ban @@ANIMAL@@ racing!"

3. "Hold on! @@NAME@@ has a powerhouse Gambling Industry – do you really want to give it all up because of some @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@?" asks @@RANDOM_NAME@@, owner of the @@CAPITAL@@ @@ANIMAL@@ Stadium. "What we need is less regulation - so we can race the animals more often, and draw more punters in. Besides, the @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@ love to race - at least compared to the beatings."

4. "There's a better solution to this all," suggests animal shelter volunteer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, as she fixes a leash to a @@ANIMAL@@. "There is a problem, but it isn't with the @@ANIMAL@@ racing industry; it's that not enough people are adopting @@ANIMAL_PLURAL@@. All we need is a national campaign to persuade people to adopt a @@ANIMAL@@ - and you can set them an example!" Handing you a grizzled old @@ANIMAL@@, she finishes, "Here's Buddy."

[b][anchor=328]#328[/anchor]: Bugged by Lack of Intelligence [Mediterreania; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
A naval frigate from @@NAME@@ was recently ambushed by a rival navy in the international waters of @@REGION@@. Security analysts have admitted that faulty intelligence was to blame and are now insisting that something be done to prevent a situation like this happening again.

The Debate
1."The best way to gain accurate intelligence is when it's in transit," says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a communications technician from the @@NAME_INITIALS@@SA, while hunched over a computer. "Think of the information the @@NAME@@ Security Agency could get from telephone calls, emails, radio chatter, even internet browsing history! All we would need are satellites, servers, algorithms, and quality mathematicians to intercept them. It might be costly, but you don't want another embarrassing incident, do you?"

2."We don't need to spend so much money on technology when we can rely on manpower," says Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, head of the @@NAME@@ Intelligence Agency, while putting on a pair of black shades. "Can a computer gain a leader's trust? Can a telephone stop a terrorist? We need inside men around every foreign diplomat, general and guerrilla this side of @@REGION@@!"

3."Speaking of inside men…" says an unnamed secret service agent, stepping out of the shadows, "How do we know they haven't infiltrated our intelligence services? Think about it, how else would they know our plans and convoy routes? Spies and insurgents -- now they are the real problem; a problem I can get rid of if you let me launch a secret investigation with, eh, secret results.

4."I know of a cheaper option," says your intern, lifelessly scrolling through whistleblowing site KwikiLeaks. "Why bother spending so much on the intelligence services here, when whistleblowers from others are posting all their information online? You could just set up some 'game rooms' for bored, tech-savvy kids. Make a game out of finding useful electronic intelligence and reward them with pizza or something."

[b][anchor=329]#329[/anchor]: Military Uniforms Under Scrutiny [Crimsonrayne; ed: Sedgistan][/b]

The Issue
In response to changing fashion trends amongst the youth of @@NAME@@, new recruits to the military have petitioned the government to update the army's dress code accordingly.

The Debate
1. "Permission to speak, sir?" asks Private Third Class @@RANDOM_NAME@@, saluting you. "Many of us are tired of looking the same, and would like the freedom to express ourselves through our appearance, sir. I mean, sir, it doesn't hurt to let us dye our hair once in a while, does it?"

2. "This is ridiculous!" roars @@RANDOM_NAME@@, shaking his fist at you. "If I tell a soldier to put on pantaloons and a tunic, there's a good reason for it - and I expect to be obeyed without question. And who are these soldiers demanding change anyways? I'd like to see them court-martialed!"

3. "You know," murmurs romantic novelist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, dreamily staring out the window. "A change of uniform might not be too bad. What if we made all our soldiers wear medieval suits of armour? It would sure highlight the chivalry and honour of @@NAME@@'s armed forces."

4. "Actually, battle armour is a great idea!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, representative from Better Future Inc, dumping a bundle of papers on your desk. "Here's our blueprints for the latest battlesuits that we've come up with. Sure it will be costly, but it will make our soldiers invincible!"

5. "The solution is not through technology, but through religion," declares zealot @@RANDOM_NAME@@ as she waves a censer under your nose. "Why not make all soldiers fight in the name of @@FAITH@@, and give them priestly robes while they're at it?"

6. "Why make them wear anything?" asks nudist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, standing to attention in your office. "Without clothes to impede them, your soldiers can move faster in battle - and we don't have to waste any more money on uniforms. Besides, all you need is a gun to kill someone, right?"

[b][anchor=330]#330[/anchor]: Supermarkets Gobbling Up All The Customers? [Fayd; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
The recent boom in the nationwide supermarket Humongo-Mart has brought representatives from local mom and pop stores to your office demanding action be taken.

The Debate
1. "Humongo-Mart is destroying our livelihoods!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the owner of a small butchery, while waving a bloody cleaver. "These chains are over-saturating our cities with ridiculously low prices. I simply can't compete. You need to put a stop to this. We need more regulations dictating where these supermarkets can be."

2. "You've got to be kidding me," scoffs business columnist @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "You want to punish businesses if they become too successful? They started small just like everyone else. If you regulate or – heaven forbid – ban big business, can you imagine the fallout? Without corporations to compete with, these small shops could gouge their prices. Never mind what capping industry growth would do to the economy. If anything we need less government meddling."

3. "This raises an interesting question," begins amateur philosopher @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Why should we leave an essential commodity such as food up to the whims of profits and greed? The government needs to step in and take control of the food production in this country. You could ensure that every citizen is provided with a well-balanced, healthy meal instead of this overpriced slop. People shouldn't have their health and basic needs held hostage by greedy corporations!"

[b][anchor=331]#331[/anchor]: Swept Away [Mostly armless; ed: Dustistan, Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
Unusually heavy rainfall this week burst riverbanks and caused flash flooding in @@NAME@@'s low-lying areas. This has sparked much debate on how the state should deal with flood damage.

The Debate
1. "We need help to recover from this horrible flood!" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a resident of the flooded zone, trying to stop his hands from shaking. "I've lost everything: my house, cars, yacht. There was no time to recover anything before it was swept away. The government should compensate us for our losses. It wasn't our idea to can the dam project, after all, and if I get no help I'll be without a roof to live under.

2. "At the end of the day, they chose to live in a flood plain. Why should the government pay anything at all to these half-brained idiots?" rants @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a prominent campaigner for lower government spending. "If they want money when there's a flood, they should get insurance and hang the expense. Make them bear the costs of their own lunacy. You don't see ME whining about the whippersnappers that broke one of my windows last fall. Why? Because I paid for insurance!"

3. "These floods should never have happened in the first place," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a noted architect, with an excited glint in her eye. "They've caused widespread destruction and damage; the repairs will cost millions of @@CURRENCY@@, and this doesn't count the millions more people are asking in compensation. What I propose is that the government invest heavily in massive flood defenses. Dams! Levees! Floodways! Dikes! Dams! Gates! Wall off the seas and lakes! Put flood gates on every river! No, dam them all up! Then build more dams! We'll have no more floods in @@NAME@@!"

4. "You know what? Why don't we use the cheap, easy solution to stop this problem?" says @@RANDOM_NAME@@, floating past on a makeshift raft. "Just stop people from building on flood plains. If you're not in a floodable area, you can't get flooded. Who's going to complain? A bunch of real-estate developers? Please! Even the environmentalists will be happy, because the land will become some kind of nature reserve."

[b][anchor=332]#332[/anchor]: Summit Security Spending Stirs Strife [Nation of Quebec; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
After @@NAME@@ agreed to host the annual Organization of Really Dominant Economic Regimes (ORDER) summit, opposition parties have slammed the government for planning to spend over a billion Imperial Credits on security alone. They are demanding an explanation.

The Debate
1. Your press secretary speaks on your behalf at a press conference. "In times of terror and uncertainty, it's imperative we take all necessary precautions. After all, @@NAME@@ is playing host to the world and has an obligation to provide top-notch security. A small tax hike to keep us and our allies safe is absolutely worth it. After all, these summits always bring out dangerous anarchists. If we don't arm the police for the worst, a world leader could get shot!"

2. "A billion @@CURRENCY@@ on security? Outrageous!" exclaims seasoned and radical protester @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while recovering from the effects of pepper spray. "No previous host spent nearly that much. This is a summit about strengthening the economy. How does blowing a billion @@CURRENCY@@ on this improve the economy? It doesn't! That's money better spent on us, the people! Our tax money should be going to teaching our children better math skills, not buying another taser!

*3. "What if I told you that you could still have this summit without spending billions or starting riots?" states your IT repairwoman, Leroy Stevens, as he reboots your laptop. "Why not use a video chat software to connect with other world leaders? Just find a secure place with a really stable internet connection and voilà!

[b][anchor=333]#333[/anchor]: No Sacrifice, No Sacrifice At All [Emunia; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
After a recent exposé of controversial religious rituals practised by some immigrants from distant, less well-developed countries, @@NAME@@ premier conservative think tank, [i]The Coffee Cabal[/i], has called on the government to regulate these religions and their worship.

The Debate
*1. "These acts are an attack on @@NAME@@'s moral fiber!" stresses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the investigative reporter responsible for the exposé. "There are just some things that freedom of religion shouldn't cover, and that includes ritual sacrifice, the harming of children or animals, or hell, even really bad choral singing. The government must enact restrictions on religious practices that offend public decency." [[color=blue]Must not have ritual sacrifice[/color]]

*2. "These acts are an attack on @@NAME@@'s moral fiber!" stresses @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the investigative reporter responsible for the exposé.

The government must enact restrictions on religious practices that offend public decency." [[color=red]Must have ritual sacrifice[/color]]

3. "Dancing blindfolded around cucumbers while carrying wailing children on our heads is a custom that dates back millennia in our culture", explains @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a High Priest of one of the under-fire religions. "The freedom to practice our religion played a large part in our relocation to @@NAME@@. The government must preserve our right to our culture and religion, even if the majority of people find them disturbing. Haven't you heard of tyranny by the majority? A religious exemption should be made for all the laws of @@NAME@@ to ensure our freedom."

4. "This is a dangerous discussion," writes @@RANDOM_NAME@@ in her popular online journal, 'Religious Watchblog'. "If we allow a religious exemption to any law, offences like religiously motivated terrorism would be permitted. It's insane. I could live with allowing religious schools to decide whether or not to teach evolution, but allowing people of faith to exist outside the law is ludicrous. The government should create a ministry that considers whether or not religious practices are compatible with the nation's ethos."

5. "Once again, only I have the guts to call a problem by its real name," says right-wing radio host @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "Everyone else is too afraid to point out the real problem here, and it's very simple; these immigrants and their brutish religions are antithetical to the basic, founding principles of @@NAME@@. They don't belong here, pure and simple. From now on, people who don't belong to a major religion should not be allowed in this country."

6. "The real problem isn't immigration, it's religion," announces prominent far-left politician @RANDOM_NAME@@ "Yes, the practices outlined in those articles are horrifying, but they're no more horrifying than the religious practices the people of @@NAME@@ have been undertaking since time immemorial. It's time we recognized that, as a forward-thinking people, we can no longer afford to allow the practice of any religion."

The Issue
Following his purchase of a large plot of land in the middle of @@CAPITAL@@, Samuel Dada, the heir to a fortune made on the back of the @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ industry, has begun his conversion of the property into a vast and unusual mansion. Busybodies are in an uproar at the design, however, which they claim is everything from "out of social context" and "bizarre" to "just plain ugly".

The Debate
1. "This monstrosity must be torn down immediately!" claims local harridan and book-club member, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "The trees in the garden spell a frightening word from the balcony; and the tower looks like a - a - well, you know! Mr. Dada's mansion may be his own, but the government must intervene in the name of taste and common decency. There should be a licensing organisation to approve all future renovations of buildings, lest we be plagued by these architectural abominations."

2. "Come on... it's my house, fer chrissakes," bemoans Mr. Dada, lounging on a sun-deck outside his home, elaborate cocktail and trophy-wife close by. "Surely I can do what I like to my own stuff? Like that time I painted my third car violet - that was cool, wasn't it? Don't you just hate it when someone bumbles over - I bet you know just what I mean - and starts tellin' you what to do? Man, I hate that. So, look, right, let's just go inside, have a drink, and forget this whole thing ever happened."

3. "Why is this even a national debate?" asks obviously strung-out and possibly hungover bureaucrat, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, mumbling, "It's just a waste of time... Look. Whatever you do, you're going to be unpopular. Why don't you just dodge the bullet? Let local authorities decide - and even decide if it's their job to decide. That way you don't annoy anyone, and, hey, I'm sure there's some bunch of local government advocates who'll love you for it. Now. Can I go home? Please?"

A crowd of nerds, bored of isolated consoles, demand that you reconnect @@NAME@@ to the Internet, so that they may once again explore a world of knowledge, view porn, play their favorite nation simulator, and watch some more porn.

1. "A man can only do so much with a non-connected personal computer," laments @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a pale, bespectacled nerd clutching his laptop. "I'm sick and tired of solitaire, word processing, and re-organizing my desktop icons. I need engagement! I need entertainment! I need to watch p— I mean...

Kids are reading for enjoyment again. If you give them back the Internet, that all goes out the window. And for what? Lolcats?

3. "We already sent that evil series of tubes out of our glorious nation; now it's that devil machine's turn!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a particularly troubled backwoods preacher. "Go all the way and ban computers completely! We must return to simpler times for the sake of our future! To heck with productivity, do this NOW!"

We simply cannot compete with the global market. We need to take their minds off of the Web. Now, the only reason these people are clamoring for the Web is because they're bored with what a single PC can do. What we need to do is make it more FUN!

Now, the only reason these people are clamoring for the Web is because they're bored with what a single PC can do. What we need to do is make it more FUN! If you create state programming collectives, we can churn out top-notch, locally produced retro games that'll make people forget all about the Internet."

[b][anchor=336]#336[/anchor]: Polygamy Causes Division [Lordieth; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
The court system in @@NAME@@ has ground to a halt since the record-breaking divorce case of serial-polygamist Matt Trimony, who has decided to divorce all 47 of his wives simultaneously. The case has become so lengthy and complex that lawyer-filled encampments have sprung up outside the building, preventing any new cases from being processed.

The Debate
1. "The courts just can't cope with the strain," warns @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your trusted legal advisor. "Divorce cases have become so complex that lawyers now have to take courses in complex mathematics just to settle property disputes! If this continues any longer, our legal system is going to collapse. The best solution would be to make prenuptial agreements mandatory for all new marriages. That would free up the courts from dealing with complex property disputes once and for all."

2. "This is sacrilege!" exclaims Reverend @@RANDOM_NAME@@, bursting into your office without warning. "It was a mistake to legalize polygamy to begin with! It's made a mockery of the sanctity of marriage. I implore the government to repeal this perversion of matrimony and make polygamy illegal throughout @@NAME@@ - if not for the sake of the families it has torn apart, then for their very souls under the eyes of our great Lord."

3. "I've got a better idea," claims renowned TV critic @@RANDOM_NAME@@, sprawling paperwork across your desk. "You want to keep polygamy legal, but don't want to pay through the nose in legal fees, right? Why not broadcast the divorce proceedings live across @@REGION@@? Think of the drama! Think of the viewing figures! Just sign here on the dotted line, and the studio will cover all the expenses." She forces a pen into your hand.

[b][anchor=337]#337[/anchor]: Doctors Crossing Borders? [Whiskey hill; ed: Sanctaria][/b]

The Issue
In response to an increasing number of people without adequate health care in @@NAME@@, a neighbouring nation within @@REGION@@ has publicly sought permission to establish free health clinics.

The Debate
1. "Well isn't this quite the blessing!" exclaims @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your chief economic advisers. "Not only does foreign money come into our economy, those darned socialists will stop complaining about how badly the poor are suffering. Best of all, we don't even have to spend a single @@CURRENCY@@ on it! We could even charge an establishment fee for each clinic and help ourselves to the proceeds."

2. "How dare those bleeding heart foreigners make us look like a Third World Nation!" declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the maintenance man in your office as he fixes your mini-bar. "They want to waltz on into OUR COUNTRY and make US look like the bad guys, just so they can have the spotlight. They don't actually care about the poor! Speaking of the poor, if they don't have to pay for things like health care then what incentive is there to find work? It's just reinforcing the culture of dependency and laziness that exists among some in the working class. Charity should just be banned, frankly; if you didn't work for it, you don't deserve it."

3. "We can't allow ourselves to be shamed like this in front of the global community, or our own people for that matter", your bedraggled Minister for Health tells you. "We should take this as a sign that it's finally time for us to devote resources to the health budget and establish a universal health care system. It may be costly in the beginning but it'll save us much in the long run, and not just in terms of @@CURRENCY@@ - think of how much face we'll save in the international community by implementing this instead of asking others to do it for us. I can't see a loss to this!"

[b][anchor=338]#338[/anchor]: The Silence and the Fury [The golden koko; ed: Luna Amore][/b]

The Issue
A large, silent mass of people have staged a sit-in around the government buildings in @@CAPITAL@@ to protest noise pollution.

The Debate
1. The leader of the protest, Sy Lance, slips a handwritten letter across your desk. It reads: "The noise level in this city has become simply unbearable. I cannot walk down the street without having my delicate auditory faculties assaulted! For the sake of the nation's hearing, you must enact stricter noise pollution laws. I implore you!"

2. "WHAT?! YOU WANT TO BAN NOISE?! WELL, SOME OF US AREN'T OVERSENSITIVE! WE LIKE NOISE!" bellows a local construction worker. "I DON'T BUST MY HUMP WORKING DAY IN AND DAY OUT JUST TO HAVE THESE SISSIES TELL ME I NEED TO KEEP IT DOWN! WE DEMAND THE RIGHT TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS WE WANT, WHATEVER THE TIME, WHEREVER THE PLACE!"

[b][anchor=339]#339[/anchor]: The Bear Necessities [Sovietiya; ed: Lenyo][/b]

The Issue
"Planning for the People," a popular new movement, has been holding protests all over the country after a recent crisis where the Economic Planning Committee accidentally sent 10 tonnes of teddy bears to a small town in dire need of wheat.

The Debate
1. "This has gone on long enough!" shouts the leader of the protest, @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "While I am a patriot of our glorious @@TYPE@@, things are far from perfect. No-one wants to return our economy to capitalist exploitation, but something must be done about the bureaucratic mess that our country is in! Comrades, instead of centralized planning, we can have a democratically-controlled regionally-devolved economy! Finally we can achieve the socialist dream of workers' power!"

2. "This is utter madness!" seethes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, one of your most trusted economic planners. "The country would be in ruins without our central planning! Who ensures that everything runs smoothly? Sure we mess up sometimes, but hey, we are only human. Besides, we intended to send that town teddy bears. Hmm... yeah, we did intend it! Those teddy bears are edible, you know?"

3. "More socialism? Have you all gone mad?" fumes foreign @@MAJOR_INDUSTRY@@ tycoon @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose face is now turning blue with rage. "Violet save me! Your government has no business telling people like me how to run OUR businesses! The only real way to rebuild your anemic economy is to bring back capitalism. Some free market shock therapy would do @@NAME@@ wonders."
