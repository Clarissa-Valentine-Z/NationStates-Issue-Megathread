[b][anchor=1360]#1360[/anchor]: Ask A Stupid Question? [Fauxia; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The nation’s strict immigration standards prevent foreigners from becoming citizens without proper education in the nation’s culture and history. However, a recent study shows that many natural-born @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ could not pass the same exam.

The Debate
1. “I don’t see why we need to hold immigrants to a different standard than native citizens,” says test administrator Charles Clean, looking up the weather on the day of the nation’s founding for question 376. “We ought to treat everyone in @@NAME@@ the same and make them take the citizenship exam when they reach the age of majority. If they fail, they can be sent to whatever country their family originated from. If we can’t find it, just send them to Bigtopia; I hear they could use some cheap labor.”

2. “Just let everyone in,” mumbles the laziest customs officer, Ingrid Jones, who is doing a crossword in the corner. “It’s too much work — I mean, it’s silly to hold them to a standard that isn’t there. Just have them pass a basic background check to make sure they’re hopefully not an Ultra-Violetist nutjob or serial jaywalker, then grant citizenship to them and their descendants. If it’s good enough for @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@, it should be good enough for everyone else.”

3. “Don’t listen to that idiot,” counters nationalist speaker Michael Rabin, recently named ‘Most Eloquent’ in the Jingoists’ Choice Awards. “If a person has @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ blood, then they’re kin and we have a duty to protect their precious lives. The only immigrants we should allow in are those that can contribute, so they ought to take the tests on entry. And since the children of immigrants won’t have @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ blood, they’ll have to take the test too. Families should be proud if one of them passes and can live here.”

4. “There’s no need to address this so harshly,” asserts high school teacher Sonequa Wonka, writing an incomprehensible pictorial equation on the wall. “If we increase funding on education, with a focus on civics, there won’t be any more of these ignoramuses. Then the immigrants will have a fair standard to live up to. We could even offer free classes to would-be citizens to help them prepare for the test. A little education never hurt anyone.”

[b][anchor=1361]#1361[/anchor]: Fundamental Rights [The Free Joy State; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The surprise hit of the @@CAPITAL@@ Film Festival is [i]Kreator Kids[/i], a controversial documentary featuring Drew Shaffer's hardline evangelical homeschool curriculum — 'Curricula of Really Advanced Programmes' — which critics claim pushed racist, revisionist, sexist rhetoric and told children set theory was the work of the Devil. As you walk to your office building, the furore outside is almost as loud as the award buzz.

The Debate
1. "I don't want homeschooling to be associated with these irresponsible ideologues who brainwash their credulous kiddos!" huffs homeschooling mother @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, stopping you to shove a science text in your face, open at a page depicting a purple dinosaur doing a backstroke and titled H[i]ow the [u]Real[/u] Nessa Lake Creature Disproves Evilution[/i]. "Register us all centrally, vet us regularly and send all kids whose parents fail back to school. Test our children in all academic subjects, even critical thinking. People will soon see that many homeschoolers are competent."

2. "That 'documentary' is a liberal hatchet job!" Documentary participant Jiminy Jehoshaphat Rutter, a father of 13 children whose names all begin with a J, stomps up to you. "Parents know their unique progeny better than the state, or some 'filmmaker'. At home, I can teach my kids our religion without some Cyanist coming to serve rice with saffron and pomegranate and tell my babies about some 'Festivaqua' feast day! Uphold a parent's unrestricted right to homeschool; no nannying checks. Heck, if you value parental rights, you should also let us withdraw our munchkins from [i]any[/i] class we decide they don't need: religious education, biology, history, whatever."

3. "Dear Violet, no!" gasps @@RANDOMNAME@@, the former educator of Mr. Rutter's triplets — Jinny, Jilly and Jenny — as @@HE@@ runs behind him. "Mr. Rutter's children must have rights, too: the right to an education that prepares them for [i]any[/i] life they'd choose. To protect children, all homeschooling must be banned. Money wasted weeding out the rotten apples could be spent on school improvements: smaller class sizes, more teachers, programmes for gifted students, support for struggling students and a deluxe detention hall where children are held in place with magnets... Or, just all the other stuff. Whatever."

4. You finally reach your office. The voice of Dilys Shaffer, mother of the curriculum author and a travelling traditional values speaker, drifts from a rally outside your window. "Deny this wisdom and deny the Truth! Total obedience is [i]always[/i] better and women [i]were[/i] built to meekly serve. I call to @@LEADER@@: seek not the depressive, worldly life of the overeducated. It leads only to blasphemy, introspection, raucous singing and shameless solicitation." She raises a graph that appears to show the number of solicitors. "Permit only pure, home-based education; fathers shall teach sons practical manly skills, and girls will learn quiet domestic arts from their mothers."

[b][anchor=1362]#1362[/anchor]: The Trans Panic Button [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A man picked up a transgender woman at a bar and brought her home, where he subsequently murdered her, beating her to death. In the ensuing court case, his lawyer argued a “trans panic” defense: the shock of realizing he had inadvertently picked up a trans woman sent his client temporarily criminally insane, rendering him irresponsible for his actions. The jury agreed, acquitting him of all charges.

The Debate
1. “This is an outrage!” cries the prosecuting attorney @@RANDOMNAME@@, while slamming the court records on your desk and then writing ‘OUTRAGE’ in big letters with a red sharpie on the first page. “We cannot let defense lawyers play to the prejudices of the juries. Would we tolerate this if it was suggested someone went insane because they picked up a Bigtopian woman? Outlaw the practice of defense lawyers using sexuality and gender identity of the victim as mitigating factors.”

2. Defense attorney @@RANDOMNAME@@ storms into your office and silently mimes yelling while wildly gesticulating; finally, @@HE@@ actually speaks. “Sorry about that, but you were thinking of taking away my ability to speak freely while defending my clients. My client was already suffering from depression and a thyroid problem and the transgender nature of the victim provides critical context to the defendant’s mental state at the time of the murder. What sort of pertinent information will you outlaw defense attorneys from presenting next? In the end you have to trust juries to decide what’s a legitimate defense argument and what’s not.”

3. “@@HE@@ kind of has a point,” notes LGBT activist @@RANDOMNAME@@, while affixing a sticker of a rainbow-colored @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ flag to your desk. “The problem is that there’s so much latent bias among @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ that juries fall for this tripe. Ultimately the responsibility for changing things falls on @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ leaders, which last I checked includes you. Increase LGBT representation in your cabinet and government, sign more laws preventing LGBT discrimination and mandating LGBT hiring, and promote more anti-hate crime legislation. Do what needs to be done to change @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ hearts and minds.”

[b][anchor=1364]#1364[/anchor]: Payday Groans [Lancaster of Wessex; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
Payday loan outlets provide quick loans to financially challenged individuals, but at interest rates far above what banks and other lenders charge. They have become the latest target of itinerant anti-poverty activists.

The Debate
1. “These payday loan and cheque cashing places are nothing more than money-hungry parasites preying on the weak and vulnerable!” declares placard-hoisting campaigner @@RANDOMNAME@@. “By charging ridiculous levels of compound interest, they put their users deeper and deeper into debt! You must intervene and govern the entire loan business: set maximum interest rates, lessen fees charged for their services, and impose heavy fines on violators!”

2. “It’s none of the government’s business what I charge in terms of interest rates and fees; this is supposed to be a free market, is it not?” bemoans payday loan magnate Cashius Chekov. “I provide an invaluable service to people who need quick funds, for important things like leaky roofs, bicycle accidents, Eckie-Ecola sales... important things. Charging 40% interest isn’t exorbitant; you can tell by the lines of happy clients who visit us every day! Stay out of our business, and we’ll stay out of yours.”

3. “Payday loan and cheque cashing institutions are notorious for money laundering and other dubious activities,” scowls Chief Detective @@RANDOMNAME@@ of the @@CAPITAL@@ Police Department. “Do you know how many phony cheques are cashed, or criminal activities are facilitated through the North-Northwestern Union money transfer service? If you want to help stymie crime, just shut down the entire industry. People can use banks, which have much more stringent security procedures.”

[b][anchor=1365]#1365[/anchor]: Balancing the Box [Nuremgard; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
A number of people have been imprisoned for failing to pay the license fee that funds the public @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Broadcasting Corporation. The subject has sparked passionate debate in the media and on breakfast shows.

The Debate
*1. “An impartial and well-funded public broadcaster is essential to a democratic society,” says highly paid  @@DEMONYMADJECTIVEINITIALS@@BC presenter @@RANDOMNAME@@, while he sips a fifty percent coconut milk decaf venti latte, no sugar and extra cream. “Most hardworking, decent people value and recognise the work we do. They get so many different services for their fees such as television channels, radio programmes, my expense acco - I mean, educational documentaries. I say toughen enforcement of the license fee with a fleet of television detector vans to catch fee evaders and send them straight to jail.” [[color=red]Must have prisons[/color]]

*2. TBD [[color=blue]Must not have prisons[/color]]

3. “You could decriminalise license fee evasion,” suggests judge @@RANDOMNAME@@, whose workload is evenly split between murder and license fee trials. “The national broadcaster provides a good service but it doesn’t seem fair to give people a criminal record for something so trivial. Also, it discriminates against poor people who can’t afford the license fee. If the fees were dealt with as a civil matter, like when people fail to pay their energy bills, debt collectors would be able to seize property to pay the debt.”

4. “Why don’t we fund the  @@DEMONYMADJECTIVEINITIALS@@BC out of general taxation instead?” yawns an under-depreciated junior Treasury minister, who is finding this funding discussion rather taxing. “That way, the broadcaster gets the money it needs, no one has to pay an expensive license fee and no one goes to prison or have their property seized. Everyone’s going to benefit, well, except for the taxpayers, but it’s accrual world after all. Anyways, I’d really appreciate it if you’d let me defer my role in this discussion. Calc-you-later.”

5. “A license fee to watch TV? Public funding? What are we, East Lebatuckese?” questions billionaire media mogul RuPaul Murmarina, the owner of @@ANIMAL@@ News. “Forcing people to pay an archaic institution for supposedly impartial news and educational content is nonsense. I say privatise the broadcaster and let the free market do what it does best: meet the needs of the people by telling them what to think.”

[b][anchor=1366]#1366[/anchor]: Parklife [Pythaga; ed Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
Public parks all across @@NAME@@ are in shambles, with sports fields overgrown and playgrounds rusting themselves to pieces, all due to a lack of sufficient funding. While the upper-crust of @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ society have taken to funding and operating their own parks on private property, large segments of urban populations have been left recreationally disenfranchised. A plethora of interested parties are demanding that you take a swing at the problem.

The Debate
1. “This clearly shows that private enterprise is much better at running parks than your government,” boasts wealthy gut lord @@RANDOMNAME@@, parked in your chair with @@HIS@@ feet on your table. “How about you put all of the public parks up for auction? Then they’ll finally be competently managed, complete with well-maintained grounds and top-tier facilities. It would provide the public with a sense of enormous well-being, for what the free market deems a fair price.”

2. “But think of the disadvantaged children!” bemoans annoyingly noble single parent @@RANDOMNAME@@. “If all parks are made private, those heinous entry fees would mean I couldn’t even afford to get in! It simply isn’t fair that so many youngsters can’t safely run around outside, so instead you must use government funds to restore our public recreational spaces. That way every child has an equal playing field, and then we’d be happy for the rest of our days, safe in the knowledge there will always be a bit of @@NAME@@ devoted to us.”

3. “But that alone is not enough!” shouts @@RANDOMNAME@@, your neighbourhood dustman and part-time socialist, while waving a ‘Parks for the Proletariat’ poster in your face. “Public space is scarce, and you cannot continue to allow the upper-class to eat from their gold-plated picnic tables in their gated gardens. Take the lands those posh parks inhabit, and make them free to enjoy for all the people. From the hands of the rich, to walking hand-in-hand. That is the proper parklife.”

[b][anchor=1367]#1367[/anchor]: Sweet, Sweet Marketing [Lelscrep, ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Recent studies show childhood obesity is on the rise, and many believe this to be the fault of attention-grabbing packaging on sugary foods.

The Debate
1. “How are we supposed to keep our children healthy when all of their favorite cartoon characters are shown brazenly endorsing these products?” screams angry mother Michelle Cash. “Children who can’t readily distinguish reality from fiction are tricked into thinking they need these products to be like their heroes! We mothers demand that packaging should never be designed to influence the minds of children! We demand plain and informative packaging!”

2. “Come now, surely people can be trusted to make their own decisions?” purrs fat-cat CEO Anthony Tyger. “Besides, you could argue that being exposed to advertising at an early age trains young people to be discerning consumers. It’s a form of real-life education. Trust instead in industry self-regulation, and keep government out of it. That’d be gr-r-reat!”

3. “I think the fact that this is an issue in the first place speaks volumes about the way we see larger people!” cries your morbidly obese Minister of Compassion, weeping as she munches on a bowl of frosted Happios cereal. “Why can’t we allow people to be whatever shape they are without ostracism? Let bigger kids be bigger kids, and if anyone criticizes their weight, that should be deemed illegal hate speech!”

[b][anchor=1368]#1368[/anchor]: Parking Hell [Genbu Kaiden; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
The new director of the @@CAPITAL@@ Department of Transportation has suggested that imposing dynamic parking prices might help ease the city centre’s nightmarish congestion. Because the national government owns large parts of the capital, the plan cannot proceed without your approval.

The Debate
1. Director Klaus Henderson, who was formerly a professor of urban planning, pushes up his glasses. “Dynamic parking prices will mean that not only will drivers have to pay for parking, but that the prices will change throughout the day based on the location’s demand. For example, drivers will pay more to park during busy periods. This will encourage motorists to park in quieter areas and not hog the same spot for hours on end. Take notes, there will be a quiz next week— er, sorry, force of habit there.”

2. “This isn’t a game of Maxopoly where the ‘free parking’ space gives a windfall of revenue!” complains the Minister of Labor, who’s just come from a marathon six-hour session of said game. “This plan will punish the working poor who can ill afford parking fees. If the city wants to deal with congestion, then it should start building more underground tunnels and parking garages with your help. Free parking is the right of every citizen, and you can’t start charging me — I mean, the miserably poor — for parking.”

3. “This plan is too complicated,” says the laconic Minister of Gordian Knots, who arrived in an ox cart and is now snipping at the air with a pair of scissors. “But doing nothing is not an option. Let us ban cars from the city instead. Stops congestion. Keeps things simple.”
