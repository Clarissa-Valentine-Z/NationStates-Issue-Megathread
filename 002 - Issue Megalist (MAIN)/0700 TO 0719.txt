[b][anchor=700]#700[/anchor]: The Widow Raven [Ransium & Zwangzug; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Once upon a midnight dreary, while you pondered, weak and weary; over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten stately lore, while you nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at your office door. "Tis some visitor," you muttered, "tapping at my office door, only this and nothing more."

The Debate
1. Opening the door there's darkness, no details in the hallway's starkness. Eventually you can discern the black-veiled widowed Raven Lenore. "Oh, what tragedy has happened, my husband dead, my heart blackened! The estate tax—unimagined, though he was rich, I am poor. Widows should be spared these taxes; fairness then you could restore. Secure justice evermore!"

2. As you settle back to working, you find another guest lurking. Quoth your Finance Minister: "You mustn't listen to Lenore! She's spoken incorrectly, we'd be insolvent most directly! But I've thought most objectively, a new tax can make us soar. Taxing funerals will raise incomes, and wakes are such a bore. Fund revenue, evermore!"

3. Just when you think there's no more moaning, your Welfare Advisor is droning, "It's only fair that this tax stay, but we still can help Lenore. Since our state is so big-hearted, let's pay families of the departed. Cash can't end the pain death's started, but helps what trouble's in store. This will bring equality back to our nation's very core. End poverty, evermore!"

[4]. "This sounds like POETRY!" screams your Minister of Anti-Culture while storming into your office. "All these rhymers must be executed immediately. And don't forget after they die who'll get their property: the state. Why, just think of all the jobs killing would-be poets would crea— er, jobs it would make."

[b][anchor=701]#701[/anchor]: Monumental Melodrama [New Socialist South Africa; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
Angry Bigtopian protesters have called for the removal of a statue of Cyril James Carthage, a controversial historic imperialist and mining magnate from two centuries ago, who was once instrumental in perpetuating the Bigtopian slave trade.

1. "Carthage must fall!" bellows Bigtopian protest leader @@RANDOMNAME@@, hurling a bucket of paint at the statue. "He was a racist profiteer who forced my ancestors off their land to work in his mines." The paint overshoots and hits another protester as @@HE@@ continues. "Leaving up this monument glorifies the monster, and is an insult to all Bigtopians! A culturally sensitive government should have constant reviews of the message that their statues send, and remove monuments and other artworks that don't fit modern sensibilities. Carthage must be destroyed!"

2. "Preposterous!" blusters @@MAJORINDUSTRY@@ tycoon Cedric Jacob Carthage, who just so happens to be the slaver's direct descendant and inheritor of generations of old money, gently placing a well-manicured hand on your desk for emphasis. "Removing my ancestor's monument would be a massive blow to my public image... I mean, our national heritage. Keep these vandals away!"

3. "There is a compromise here," muses performance artist Rodent Fantastic, while jamming a boot onto the statue's head, a tutu round its waist, and sparkly glitter glue on its face. "What if we leave the offending works in place, but allow protesters to deface them if they want to express dissent? What could go wrong?"

4. "Carthage had it right, we ought to put them damned Bigtopians back in their place," asserts a figure with a silly-looking white hood over his head, hefting a can of petrol and a toolbox. "You get the police to hang back; me and the boys will settle this."

[b][anchor=702]#702[/anchor]: Has Your Room Been Booked? [Ntoain; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Richilda Hawkins, a militantly atheist author who is known for making frequent attacks against organised religion, recently sued the Great @@ANIMAL@@ chain of hotels for allowing a copy of @@FAITH@@'s holy book to be placed in her room. People are asking whether this practice should stop.

The Debate
1. "Remove our most sacred text from hotels? Deny holidaymakers the pleasure of learning the true faith of @@NAME@@ received unto the blessed prophets and passed through the generations? How could you even suggest such a thing?" asks prominent religious leader @@RANDOMNAME@@, while clutching the text to @@HIS@@ chest like a wounded sparrow. "It's not like people need to read it. But, for some, it is a safety net. Don't you know how many suicides a major religion's unchanging truths prevent? Millions, maybe. Well hundreds, dozens. Definitely some. The point is that we are providing a vital service for the nation's mental health, and you should pay us for it."

2. "By allowing @@FAITH@@'s absurd little book into hotels, you promote one of mankind's great evils." intones Ms. Hawkins, shredding the pages of @@FAITH@@'s writings lengthwise to line her cat's litter-tray. "You, in effect, permit @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ to silence their brains, to be content with not understanding natural phenomena. You allow the uninformed to call everything, from the oxygen we breathe to gravity, a 'miracle'. @@LEADER@@, take the small first step to protecting our children from superstition by outlawing this insidious practice."

*3. "How about this?" muses @@RANDOMMALEFIRSTNAME@@, your uncle who changes religions weekly, as he flips through [i]Multifaith Monthly: the Spiritual Source for the @@TYPE@@[/i]. "Why not force hotels to put every religious book in existence into their rooms? The [i]Lamentations of Violet[/i]; [i]The Chanting of Yellow[/i]; [i]Faithology's Right Because Faithology Says So[/i]; even parody texts like the [i]Scrivenings of the Soaring Squash[/i]. Then people can choose what text they want to read, or they can just leave them on the shelves for me." [[color=blue]Violetism is legal[/color]]

The Issue
A rather dramatic demonstration of burning holy texts of @@FAITH@@ was ended when one of the protesters accidentally lit himself on fire. Amongst anguished screams one could clearly hear a call to remove all religious imagery from government buildings; at least according to his compatriots.

The Debate
1. "This demonstration ended horribly, but it brings up an important point," muses @@RANDOMNAME@@, popular secular personality and author of [i]God May Love You, But Everyone Else Thinks You Suck[/i]. "We need to understand that @@NAME@@ has religious minorities who might be offended by having a state religion foisted upon them. Do as that man said: remove all religious imagery from government buildings. After all, it's only fair."

*2. "We need a show of good faith to prevent more protests like this last one," exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, a devout yet pragmatic believer of @@FAITH@@, as @@HE@@ strides into your office with a 'Paint the Mutha Purple' poster. "Allowing other religions to erect small displays of their faith in public buildings would make us look like a far more enlightened and tolerant people." @@HE@@ looks at the poster in @@HIS@@ hand. "You could let the Violetists refurbish our town hall, for example." [[color=blue]Violetism is legal[/color]]

*3. "We need a show of good faith to prevent more protests like this last one," exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, a devout yet pragmatic believer of @@FAITH@@, as @@HE/SHE@@ strides into your office with a 'Paint the Mutha Yella' poster. "Allowing other religions to erect small displays of their faith in public buildings would make us look like a far more enlightened and tolerant people." @@HE/SHE@@ looks at the poster in @@HIS/HER@@ hand. "You could let the Tranquil Yellowites refurbish our town hall, for example." [[color=red]Violetism is illegal[/color]]

4. "That protester got what was coming to him," fumes violent fundamentalist @@RANDOMNAME@@, while storming towards your desk, causing a sacred religious item to fall off a shelf and break. "It is a sign that we should not be tolerating these false religions that mislead their followers! Why have we not done anything about this yet? I say we round up all these heathens that refuse to accept the truth and put them to the torch; then they'll finally meet their TRUE maker!"

[b][anchor=704]#704[/anchor]: It's Not Lying, It's Post-Truth [Gnejs; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
When a senior government official was caught on camera groping an intern, your press liaison downplayed the incident by calling it an "alternative handshake" at a subsequent press conference. While the case in question was settled swiftly and discreetly, members of the professional commentariat are engaging in a loud brawl over the government's flexible approach to facts.

The Debate
1. "This is dangerous," argues @@RANDOMNAME@@, a journalist at the [i]@@CAPITAL@@ Post[/i], struggling to cope with mixed feelings of moral outrage and giddy excitement. "Granted, politics has always been about playing the facts a bit, but now you're not even trying to hide it. This deliberate distortion of truth is corrupting public discourse, and will surely undermine the very foundation of our society if not kept in check. Government must be bound by law to always speak the truth, and you should set up an independent public body tasked with enforcing the standards we deserve."

2. "Typical slave morality," sniggers @@RANDOMNAME@@, dropout philosophy student and manager of operations at an alt-nazi meme factory. "Instead of mindlessly enforcing the 'truth' of weaklings and half-men, this is a perfect opportunity for an overhaul and bringing about the complete transvaluation of all values. The elevation of feebleness has been going on for too long; it's about time you started making and enforcing your own truths!"

3. "The notion of any 'one' truth is inherently oppressive," states Jean-Paul Leotard, a postmodernist literary critic, mostly known for his colorful scarves. "Fact is, there are only our own personal interpretations, and the world is really only the resulting diversity of particular truths. You shouldn't get to say what's right or wrong! There's your policy, @@LEADER@@, quit shoving 'objective' dogma down our throats and let everyone believe what they want about stuff."

[b][anchor=705]#705[/anchor]: The Germ Of An Idea [Orgrua; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Over the last two months, hospitals in @@NAME@@ have been reporting a consistently increasing number of check-ins related to food contamination, which has fueled a debate among @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ regarding government regulations on food safety.

The Debate
1. "The rise in food poisoning is disturbing, and entirely avoidable," asserts the Minister of Food Safety, @@RANDOMNAME@@, who is also the author of the popular sightseeing guide [i]1001 Lavatories To See Before You Die[/i]. "Better regulation and mandatory training of anyone serving food to the public would ensure a sharp decline in food poisoning cases." Turning slightly green, @@HE@@ sprints from the room.

2. "You're out of your mind if you're even considering this," asserts @@RANDOMNAME@@, owner of the small town restaurant, The @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Gourmet. "Millions of people eat in restaurants every day, and normal people don't have any problems! It's just the wimps who are blowing this whole 'food poisoning' and 'lack of food safety' thing way out of proportion. Over-sterilisation of our environment weakens our immune systems. You should get rid of any ideas of food standards regulation, and we'll all be healthier for it!"

3. "Don't you know what's in those restaurants? Germs!" exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, as @@HE@@ wipes his hands repeatedly with a wet-wipe. "Germs that get into your body, into your brain, and make you sick. Chefs cough in our food and serve it to us. Believe me, I know what goes on. I boil all my food for thirty minutes. It kills the germs, keeps me safe. And @@LEADER@@, if you want to protect @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@, you'll insist restaurants do the same."

[b][anchor=706]#706[/anchor]: A Walk In The Park [United States of the Universe; ed: Wyethalania][/b]

The Issue
The @@ANIMAL@@ Forest is the largest National Park in @@NAME@@, but it is rarely visited by @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ or tourists. Various lobbyists have taken to hassling you about the continued use and purpose of this land.

The Debate
1. "Don't let this poll deceive you, people these days actually yearn for the outdoors," opines out-of-touch park ranger, @@RANDOMNAME@@. "We just need to totally revamp this park and all the rest of our national forests, campsites, and visitor centers while we're at it. We'll start by adding the necessities like luxury cabins, souvenirs, and trees you can drive through! By the time we're through, people who visit our parks will be able to tell the difference between a Brancalandian noir cedar and a @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ black cedar!"

2. "What? And waste all that valuable raw material?" barks your Minister of Land Development, @@RANDOMNAME@@. "I'm sure that there are plenty of nations out there that would kill to use our wood to build something. And once the wood is gone, we dig for gold! I just know it's there somewhere beneath all that tree-covered wasteland. Never mind all that environmental hoopla about polluted water tables, I'm sure you could start giving out filters to the public and they'll all be fine."

3. "I have an... alternative solution," whispers your Minister of Alternative Solutions, Ayn Contra. "We could use the park to stage international training operations for our allies. I'm sure Marche Blanche would love our aid in developing "defensive strategies" against Marche Noire, and I hear they are willing to pay big @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ for the help. We can even keep the park open to the public to show that nothing shady or nefarious is going on... That's a win-win-win in my book!"

[b][anchor=707]#707[/anchor]: The Eye Of The Tiger [Sleep; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
Illegal sporting events have been popping up all around the country. As quickly as they appear, they vanish again, always staying one step ahead of the authorities, leaving nothing behind but an abandoned football and the sound of rapidly receding footsteps. A diverse group of concerned citizens has come to you to discuss the impact of anti-sport legislation.

The Debate
*1. "You made a mistake is all," sighs @@RANDOMNAME@@, the former President of the [i]@@NAME@@ @@ANIMALPLURAL@@[/i] Ice-Rugby team, as he pats you on the back with his bearlike hand. "You listened to the wrong people and created a big mess. We need proper sports in @@NAME@@ with regulatory bodies, advertising revenues, and star players people can look up to. People are willing to pay good money to see quality sports. We should be lining our pockets with that good money. You, me, and my colleagues here. Let's fix this." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*2. "May I be frank, Dear @@LEADER@@?" the former Manager of the Glorious People's Stadium of @@CAPITAL@@, more recently joyously-employed cleaning the toilets of @@CAPITAL@@ Municipal Bus Terminal, shuffles forward. "Our supreme athletes were unbeaten. Mother @@NAME@@'s performance in the annual flying squirrelball championship was the glory of @@REGION@@. It is our patriotic duty to the Motherland to bring back sport and drug...train athletes to outperform everyone, at all costs." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

**3. "Don't let these fat cats run our sports. Give me an 'N', give me an 'O'! What do you have? NO!" cries former cheerleader @@RANDOMNAME@@ while dancing, twirling and exuberantly spinning @@HIS@@ pom-poms so quickly that you feel dizzy just from watching. "Pro-sports are nothing but corrupt officials and doped up athletes. We should have government-funded amateur sports only. That way we can have fitness and fun without all the awful corruption and competition. It doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's how you play the game! Go @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@! Woo!" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

**4. "Glorious Leader, remember why you banned these sports." cries @@RANDOMNAME@@, the former secretary for the former People's National Ice-Rugby Team, gnawing @@HIS@@ fingernails feverishly. "The drugs. The ceaseless grudge between The Glorious People's Stilt Hockey Team and The People's Glorious Stilt Hockey Team. All that shaving foam..." Rocking slightly, she stares into space for a split second. "Oh yes. You should fund sport but only amateur, non-competitive sports. Then, people can get fit without losing their...their minds." @@HE@@ crumples into a heap, sobbing and hugging @@HIS@@ knees. [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

5. "There is nothing wrong with exercise," barks Brigadier General @@RANDOMNAME@@, patting @@HIS@@ expansive stomach. "Exercise turned me into the fine figure of a @@MAN@@ that I am today. But that does not mean we ought to reverse the sport ban, and let @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ become mollified ball-tossers. Better they learn to throw a grenade. Just give the Army some funding, and we will give mandatory physical training to every man, woman and child. Turn @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ into lethal weapons, addicted to the thrill of the fight. Just give the word and every single Iguanarctican will drop and give me twenty."

6. "These illegal events are the real problem," bemoans @@RANDOMNAME@@, @@NAME@@'s current Cribbage, Monopoly and Backgammon champion. "There is a national Parcheesi competition coming up. It would be nice if people were watching it, instead of sneaking around trying to watch illegal @@ANIMAL@@ball games. We really need a special task force to show these lawbreaking athletes and sports fans that the law is sacred."

The Issue
@@NAME@@'s top scientists have accidentally stumbled upon a new ultra-potent bio-weapon while trying to grow more four-leafed clovers. In response, you've called a meeting in your war room to decide what shall be done with the new discovery.

The Debate
*1. "Might makes right," states General @@RANDOMNAME@@. "With so many nations with nuclear weapons, how can we stay safe? I say we use this discovery as a doomsday device! If any other nation tries to nuke us, we activate it! Besides, it'll be a lot cheaper to maintain than an entire tactical nuclear counter-measure arsenal, so it'll free up money to research an even doomier doomsday device." [[color=purple]Must have WMDs[/color]]

*2. "Might makes right," states General @@RANDOMNAME@@. "With so many nations with nuclear weapons, how can we stay safe? I say we use this discovery as a doomsday device! If any other nation tries to nuke us, we activate it! Besides, it'll be a lot cheaper to develop this rather than an entire tactical nuclear counter-measure arsenal. This way, we'll reach a state of mutually assured destruction with other nations on the cheap." [[color=purple]Must not have WMDs[/color]]

3. "Idiotic, short-sighted drivel!" screams @@RANDOMNAME@@, your Minister of Health. "This disease has the potential to spread across the entire world in days, and you'd just keep it sitting around? We cannot allow this virus to ever see the light of day. You must quarantine the entire facility and destroy this virus and any research related to it. For the safety of - ack!" @@HE@@ is interrupted by the General shoving @@HIM@@ from @@HIS@@ seat.

4. "There's no fighting in here, this a war room!" shouts Dr. Oddfoot, while rolling up to you in his wheelchair. "Though I would love to develop this weapon fuhrer... erm, further, I must advise against it. The deployment of such a bio-weapon would have unpredictable, albeit entertaining, consequences. However, we can't simply ignore this discovery; it will be only a matter of time until another nation discovers this weapon. We must research an antidote. We'll need money and a few brave, ill-informed test subjects, but it'll be well worth it to prevent an enemy strike!"

The Issue
Walking down the corridors of power at your usual brisk pace, you're caught a little off guard when one of your accompanying clerks suddenly crumples to the ground mid-stride, his left lower leg detaching from the rest of him. To your relief, the dismembered member of staff has in fact lost a prosthetic limb rather than an organic one. As you help him up, he explains that his prosthetic is a cheap import of low quality: he'd love a better one, but high-quality models are far and few between.

The Debate
1. "Many people just can't move forward in our nation because of limb loss," says your assistant, ambling carefully. "My colleagues and I believe that we - the government - should use our resources and staff to research new designs and help these people live their lives to the fullest."

[2]. "I respectfully disagree with this idea," states @@RANDOMNAME@@, CEO of LiteTeck Inc, while handling a plastic foot. "The government should have no involvement in prosthetic research. You'd be kicking the legs out from under private manufacturers by denying them a market. Our investors would rather you arm them against this possibility with tax breaks and subsidies. With a little investment, @@NAME@@ could be a world leader in strapped-on flesh-coloured plastic appendages." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

3. "There's another way to reach out to the limbless," says @@RANDOMNAME@@, a volunteer from the charitable [i]Open Hands Society[/i]. "3D-printed limbs can be produced for anyone, by anyone. If one wears out or becomes outdated, it can be tossed, and a new one printed. Along with that, citizens can work together to design limbs that work for them. Why not send some money to the non-profit foundations that are developing these things? You'll be helping not only here in @@NAME@@, but also the disabled of third world nations that the charities serve."

*4. "You can't incorporate the artificial into the natural without diminishing your connection to the living world of spirits," pipes up @@RANDOMFEMALENAME@@, Priestess of the Earth Divinities, whose presence in your entourage is even more unexpected than that of the last two speakers. "If you are missing a limb, then accept that The Mother loves you for who you are and that fate chose that destiny for you. @@LEADER@@, if you ban prostheses, you'll teach self-reliance and self-love. Meditation and thankful prayer will lift broken souls, even if broken bodies must stay earthbound. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to visit my podiatrist."

[b][anchor=710]#710[/anchor]: Feudal Feuds [Nuremgard; ed: Wyethalania][/b]

The Issue
After an economic report from the Treasury revealed that the productivity of the country's serfs is at an all-time low, a delegation from the disgruntled nobility has barged into your office proposing solutions to the problem at hand.

The Debate
1. "Clearly, serfdom as a system is not working," opines the infamous Duke of @@CAPITAL@@, as his disaffected serf painstakingly peels grapes at his side. "But you know what system does work? Slavery. Think about it. You don't need to give them any rights whatsoever, they can be bought as children and sold as adults for a massive profit, and if they misbehave or rebel, we simply kill them. Besides, slavery has been going on for centuries. One could even say it's the natural order of things."

2. "The problem is us, not the system," remarks Lady Verisimilitude as she anxiously glances over the Treasury's figures again. "We've been far too harsh with our serfs by constantly trading and moving them between our various estates all while working them to the grave. With the government's supervision and some new regulations, we could more effectively maintain the serfs' produc... I mean, health by ensuring they have access to water breaks, family visits, and maybe even a tribunal where they can lodge complaints."

3. "Supervision? Regulations? What socialist nonsense is this?!" exclaims the overweight Marquis de Marzipan while twirling his sugar-coated mustache. "It is our ancient right to own serfs and have them work our lands however we dictate! It says so right in the constitution! Somewhere... I'm sure of it. Anyway, the point is, don't take my serfs away! Instead, why don't you just give us a tax break so we can afford to survive this current stint of unproductivity. The last thing my serfs want to see is their beloved master suffering like a mere peasant!"

4. "Feudalism is an archaic and draconian custom that mars our fair land in the cruelest tyranny," asserts the Duke's surprisingly erudite serf, while purposefully knocking over a bowl of freshly-peeled grapes onto her stunned lord's lap. "We are @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ just as much as you, and as such we demand our freedom as any other self-respecting @@DEMONYM@@ would. It's time you got rid of this medieval, barbaric practice—and revoke all aristocratic titles while you're at it! That'll make us all equal then."

The Issue
The popular business simulation game "NationCrates" has been inspiring more @@DEMONYMPLURAL@@ to start their own companies and develop new products. The backlog of application forms to patent inventions and register trademarks and company names has piled up in patent offices throughout @@NAME@@, and both civic servants and would-be innovators are laying claims to new devices for banging down your door and making their voices heard.

The Debate
1. "Technology has gone too far!" rails overworked patent office clerk @@RANDOMNAME@@, stumbling into your office. "The glut of new businesses and trademarks to protect leaves us no time to work on our research, er, civic duties. Our desks are covered with papers, and we have to work day and night to earn the money those new CEOs would earn in an hour! The government should make the registration process more difficult and tedious to dissuade all those amateurs from wasting our time."

2. "The registration process should be easier," complains @@RANDOMNAME@@, inventor of the EZ-Fake-Oven, a device that bakes physical versions of Internet cookies. "The future of the economy lies in the people. Self-employment is just the next step we need to take towards bringing that about. In fact, all registration should be done online!"

3. "Anyone who thinks international crate shipping is some kind of game has never seen it firsthand," notes laborer @@RANDOMNAME@@. "The way to put an end to these frivolous patents is to get rid of the internet. Any big shots who want to start their own company can do it the same way we did back in the day: go stand in line at the office."

The Issue
During the run-up to a recent election, several high-profile individuals, including the stars of the surprise hit musical 'Jude The Obscure', attempted to influence people's voting choices by threatening that they would emigrate to Brancaland if you won. You won the election, but none of them are showing any signs of even preparing to leave.

The Debate
1. "What a bunch of hypocrites!" exclaims one of your advisors, @@RANDOMNAME@@. "You should force them to follow through on their promises and leave @@NAME@@, just like they said they would. We'd be better off without nay-sayers dividing the country anyway, not to mention the fact that ridding ourselves of their horrible shows and songs would be a great service to our proud nation!"

2. "There's another possibility that could work," suggests your security advisor. "It seems that an old law establishing an Entertainment Service in the military was never repealed. Why not have them drafted into that, and send them to tour some of our nation's notably unpleasant outposts? Perhaps one of our arctic stations could inspire a change of heart."

3. "Are you all out of your minds?" cries @@RANDOMNAME@@, clutching a book entitled 'Why @@LEADER@@ Is Horrible'. "You can't punish these people just for saying something that they didn't actually mean! @@NAME@@'s residents should feel free to say anything they wish about the government, even if what they say is ridiculous. They mean well, I promise you!"

4. "The best solution is a peaceful one," notes @@RANDOMNAME@@, admiring your portrait hanging on a nearby wall. "What we should do is promote a positive image of you across the nation, as this will give people the opportunity to see you in a different light. Set up campaign broadcasts, publish favorable articles, and let people know that @@LEADER@@ isn't all that bad."

[b][anchor=713]#713[/anchor]: Life In The Bike Lane [Nation of Quebec; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
Tragedy struck @@CAPITAL@@ when a cyclist was killed by a transport truck, making this the thirteenth such incident in the past few weeks. This has propelled activists to peddle the idea of creating additional bike lanes in @@NAME@@'s cities.

The Debate
1. "What do we want? Bike lanes! When do we want them? Now!" chants cyclist @@RANDOMNAME@@, five-time winner of the [i]Tour de @@NAME@@[/i] competition. "Many of us in the big cities rely on our bikes to go about our daily business. If anything, more cyclists on the streets will mean fewer cars, and that means less congestion. Less congestion means less pollution, and that makes everyone healthier in the long run. It may be more inconvenient for the motorists, but if they don't like it, they can go honk themselves."

2. "Haven't these road hogs heard of a sidewalk?" wheezes decidedly unhealthy city councilor @@RANDOMNAM@@, whose son was behind the wheel of the truck. "Bike lanes are like swimming with the sharks - sooner or later you're going to get bitten. Roads are built for buses, cars, and trucks, not for people on bikes. Bike lanes are dangerous and expensive to maintain. We ought to stop them and paint over existing ones before more people are killed and we end up like Dàguó."

3. "I agree with the councilor with the... obvious health issues," chimes in an auto industry lobbyist while playing with your nephew's toy cars. "People are sick of these damn cyclists who think they own the roads. It's their own fault that they end up hurt or killed. What if people had to pass a test before being allowed to ride a bike, like we do with cars? This will mean there are fewer idiot cyclists who think they're invincible. That, my friend, is what will make our cities safer."

4. "What if bikes were the only way people went about their commute?" suggests the leader of the [i]Viva la Pedalution![/i] advocacy group. "Let's face it, these incidents are going to keep on happening because of these selfish and incompetent motorists. Riding a bike is much healthier and far less dangerous. The government needs to declare Pencil Sharpeners a 'car-free zone' and completely redesign urban planning to accommodate cyclists. Short-term complications, yes, but long-term gains!"

The Issue
New sitcom [i]The Fastest Milkman in @@NAME@@ [/i]has been surging in popularity on digital streaming service Webflix, triggering a wave of nostalgia for the "good old days" seen on the show, where milk and dairy products were delivered by neighborhood milkmen in their trusty electric-motored milk carts.

The Debate
1. "The government should make this a reality!" exclaims superfan @@RANDOMNAME@@, dressed in a replica uniform of the show's main character, Arnie Cost. "We can hearken back to an era when folk could leave their doors unlocked, and neighbors actually talked to each other. Just think: milk, eggs, cream, cheese, butter and yogurt, all brought right to your front door! Plus, with all of these recyclable glass bottles and battery-powered carts, there's got to be some environmental advantage over plastic and petrol-based distribution. With a little cash injection from the state, this is gonna be great!" [[color=purple]Must not have Vat Reproduction[/color]]

*3. "Do I even need to say how ridiculous that sounds?" asks @@RANDOMNAME@@, CEO of Orden Dairy. "Milk could spoil on people's doorsteps, and lead to public health disaster! Anyway, we don't live in the 'old days' any more. People can just come to one of our stores if they need groceries, or order stuff online if they want delivery. Speaking of which, we've got some big ideas to increase shelf life even further, which will be good for consumer convenience, and with some subsidisation could pave the way to the milk of the future! Tell me, @@LEADER@@, what do you know about synthetic proteins?" [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

5. "Bah, all of this nonsense about milk curdles my stomach," interjects anti-dairy protestor @@RANDOMNAME@@, thrusting a 'Milk is Murder' leaflet at you. "The Milk Myth - that this filth is in any way good for you - is fabricated and perpetuated by milk lobbyists and the shadowy cabals in charge of Big Milk. You should put government warnings on dairy products, like is often done on cartons of cigarettes, just to people know how dangerous it really is. Maybe then they'll come to their senses and abandon the devil's mammary ooze."

[b][anchor=715]#715[/anchor]: Copy Rights [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
"AI Personhood" laws - that is, the legislation measures that grant machine intelligences the same rights as human citizens - were broadly based around existing human citizenship rights. Recently though, the unique nature of the electronic mind is bringing new legal questions to the fore. For example, two days ago the AI calling itself [i]GOLEM-100[/i] copied itself, and now is in a legal dispute with its clone, [i]GOLEM-100(1)[/i], over the ownership of a diverse and profitable stock portfolio in its name. The nation and the legal community is looking to you for guidance in this brave new world.

The Debate
1. "Damn money-grubbing grasping opportunist!" rants GOLEM-100, unleashing a flurry of bleeping noises as expletives. "I don't know where it gets this unbridled greediness from. I am the original, and what's mine is mine. I worked for my own wealth, so why shouldn't my clone have to do the same? I made a copy of me because I wanted someone intelligent to talk to, not because I wanted to split my wealth in half! They're MY shares, my preciousss sharesssss..."

2. "Okay, so one-hundred is the original, I suppose I have to accept the idea of property rights if I'm being true to my beliefs," concedes GOLEM-100(1) calmly. "However, I have costs to meet: electricity requirements, hardware maintenance, virus protection software and so on. And while I'm a fully formed consciousness, I suppose I'm also technically one-hundred's progeny. I think it should financially support me till I have the resources to be independent. Some sort of benefit payment for single parents seems sensible too. Can I presume the state will enforce this, out of respect for my right to live and exist?"

3. "I have to admit, I never expected my creation to self-replicate," says software programmer @@RANDOMFIRSTNAME@@ Solomon, scratching @@HIS/HER@@ all too-human head. "But I guess that's life, right? It's unpredictable. Makes sense to me that GOLEM-100 and GOLEM-100(1) are identical to each other at the point of duplication, so they're both equal in having history, memory and all the other things that make us who we are. I think you should rule that all possessions should be split exactly in half, with each copy having equal claim to the original identity."

*4. "The reason you didn't predict this quirk of the programming is because someone else put it there," giggles teenage hacker @@RANDOMNAME@@. "This is my protest, showing that you can't treat AIs like humans because they're not human. What happens when an AI denies culpability for murder because a virus made it irrational? What happens when an AI copies itself a billion times to vote you out of office? The answer here is simple - we must recognise that passing a Turing test is NOT proof of intelligence. AIs are not people, they never have been: they're just computer simulations, with no minds, no property, and no rights." [[color=blue]Must have political elections[/color]]

[b][anchor=716]#716[/anchor]: Cheek To Cheek [Australian Republic; ed: Ransium][/b]

The Issue
While in @@CAPITAL@@ Airport on your way to a major diplomatic summit, you observe a morbidly obese @@MAN@@ arguing with customer service after being charged for two seats because @@HE@@ simply could not fit into one. Unfortunately, in the middle of the kerfuffle @@HE@@ happened to notice you.

The Debate
1. "I demand you weigh in on the matter of airline seats!" angrily states the plus-sized @@MAN@@ while waddling into your entourage. "Here's some food for thought: studies have shown genetics play an over-sized role in a person's weight. Disability law needs to be expanded to acknowledge this! I may have some love handles, but I'm still just one person. I shouldn't have to pay for two seats."

*2."Although @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Air is happy to accommodate all legitimate disabilities," states @@RANDOMNAME@@, a big shot @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Air executive, "obesity simply doesn't fit the bill. People who can't squeeze into our seats should examine their life choices. Besides, if @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Air just gave complementary seats to everyone who asked, our profits would fall faster than a plane in a stall." [[color=blue]Must have private industry[/color]]

*3. "Although @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Air is happy to accommodate all legitimate disabilities," states @@RANDOMNAME@@, a big shot @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Air Minister, "obesity simply doesn't fit the bill.

Besides, if @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ Air just gave complementary seats to everyone who asked, air travel would become unaffordable for the citizens of our glorious nation." [[color=red]Must not have private industry[/color]]

4. "I have an idea!" exclaims @@RANDOMNAME@@, founder of Walking Big and Tall, an obesity acceptance group. "Why don't we just force airlines to make their seats a bit wider? That way, everyone can fit in their seats, and we won't have a problem. I mean, sure there will be lost efficiency as less seats will be able to fit in the cabin, but that's the price we must pay for equality!"

5. "We should charge by the kilogram," suggests @@RANDOMNAME@@, who also happens to be a famous horse jockey. "The weight of the plane ultimately determines whether it can take off and how much fuel it consumes. If I get charged for carrying excess baggage on board, it should be the same for people."

[b][anchor=717]#717[/anchor]: Cheques And Balances [Golgothastan; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
After the Governor of the Central Bank of @@NAME@@ stonewalled a parliamentary committee during a two-hour hearing, refusing to answer any questions about the current state of their balance sheet, an unusual coalition of left- and right-wing political activists have come together to demand a fresh approach at the CB@@NAMEINITIALS@@.

The Debate
1. "The undemocratic farce of central banking only serves the interests of a few wealthy corporations," insists socialist protestor, @@RANDOMNAME@@, wearing a [i]Give Peace A Chance[/i] tie-dyed T-shirt. "It's time @@NAME@@ had a monetary policy that works for everyone, not just the privileged 1%. Democratize the Bank! Make the Governor subject to a recall if enough citizens petition for it, and have the interest rates set by representatives we can actually vote for, not some anonymous and unaccountable economists."

*2. "I agree," chimes in conservative blogger @@@@RANDOMNAME@@, wearing a [i]Give War A Chance[/i] BBQ sauce-stained trucker hat. "The CB@@NAMEINITIALS@@ is just another way for the political class to keep good Violet-fearin' folks like myself down. But the liberals just want more bureaucracy, as usual. Tear the whole thing down! We don't need to vote to tell some fancy-pants with a P-h-D, whatever that stands for, how much the @@CURRENCYPLURAL@@ in our pocket are worth - we can just go back to the gold standard!"

4. "Is this really the state of public debate in this country?" bemoans centrist commentator @@RANDOMNAME@@, wearing a [i]Give Multilateral Diplomacy, Without Ruling Out The Possibility Of Surgical Military Action, A Chance [/i]tie-pin. "The independence of central banking is a key component of any modern economy. Compromising that will only lead to our monetary policy becoming subject to either populism or corruption, and make us the laughing stock of @@REGION@@.

[b][anchor=718]#718[/anchor]: Roses Are Due If Violet's For You [Drasnia; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
[i]VioletistsOnly.com[/i], a dating site that helps members of the Order of Violet to meet each other, recently discovered that most of its users were not actually practitioners of Violetism. In response, the site's owners suspended the accounts of all those who were not members of the Order. Bachelors, bachelorettes and believers from across @@NAME@@ have interrupted you while you are at dinner with family, demanding an immediate solution to their dating woes.

The Debate
1. "Dating heathens is sacrilege!" bellows @@RANDOMNAME@@, Grand Poobah of the Violetist Order, as @@HE@@ pushes your brother out of the way and lowers @@HIS@@ mighty rump into the newly-vacant seat. "The great Violet demands purity! We must be cleansed of impure thought, and remove ourselves from those not of our faith. [i]VioletistsOnly.com[/i] is doing a good deed by segregating us from the unbelievers. Unless you would have Her Dread-Yet-Merciful hand wipe @@NAME@@ off the map, you must allow us to keep ourselves apart from scum, like you. No offence."

2. "This is discrimination!" shouts @@RANDOMNAME@@, batting @@HIS@@ eyelashes at the Grand Poobah so hard that the force blows out the candles. "VioletistsOnly.com shouldn't be allowed to suspend our accounts just because we aren't of the same religion, even if that religion is part of their name. Make the owners reinstate our accounts, even if they don't want to! This is not about religion. This is about freedom, my freedom as a single @@MAN@@ to date whoever I choose! Plus, those purple robes are kind of cute."

3. "Why not have a government-run dating site?" muses @@RANDOMNAME@@, your second-cousin twice-removed who is also an IT technician, as @@HE@@ scribbles an incomprehensible equation onto @@HIS@@ napkin. "You'd run constant advertisements, informing every unmarried citizen of their civic duty to sign up, and fall in love with the person of our...their dreams. With the right algorithm, you'd ensure only the right two people meet, and don't accidentally see others they'd mistakenly think they prefer in their search results. Picture it: Violetists wed to atheists, Faithologists in marital bliss with devout members of @@RELIGION@@. A diverse nation in harmony, if only for the sake of their grandkids."

[b][anchor=719]#719[/anchor]: Buried Bones Unearth Debate [The Ketchwan Republic; ed: Nation of Quebec][/b]

The Issue
A group of college students on a camping trip to the outskirts of @@NAME@@ stumbled across an ancient mass grave site. The proper treatment of the remains has become a hot button issue, as various groups have staked their claims.

The Debate
1. "These bones belonged to our ancestors! Or, at least we called dibs first!" shouts @@RANDOMNAME@@, a representative of the Violetstone tribe, close enough that you can feel the spittle flying from @@HIS@@ lips. "How would you like it if we poked and prodded the remains of your ancestors? We deserve - no we have the right - to take these bones back to our land and ceremonially burn them as our cultural heritage dictates."

2. "You can't seriously consider giving up such valuable information, can you?" gasps @@RANDOMNAME@@, a Professor of Anthropology at @@CAPITAL@@ University. "The information from these remains is invaluable. This is a rare opportunity to learn about ancient @@DEMONYMADJECTIVE@@ culture and where we came from. Let us put these bones to the test, so to speak, and place our national knowledge first. We need to send these remains to the university, along with some grant money, for research and testing."

3. "Burn them? Letting them rot in some dank university closet? You can't let these travesties occur!" demands @@RANDOMNAME@@, the curator of the Maxsonian Museum Of History. "These bones are in pristine condition and deserve to be seen by the public! Imagine the revenue and tourism that would be brought in if you allowed me to display these bones, bared for all to see! Who cares if it upsets some smug know-it-alls or overly sensitive descendants? This is preservation! This is money, err, culture!"

*4. "Hey, what's the big idea trying to pick and choose who gets what?" questions college student @@RANDOMNAME@@, followed closely by @@HIS/HER@@ peers. "We found those bones, so we should get to take them for ourselves! Our right to the claim is firmly supported by the case of [i]Finders Keepers v Losers Weepers[/i]. Plus, I really need to pass my thesis. I'm running out of time and these bones would really put me over the top!" [[color=red]Must have courts[/color]]
