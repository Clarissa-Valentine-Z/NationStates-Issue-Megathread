[b][anchor=1360]#1360[/anchor]: Ask A Stupid Question? [Fauxia; ed: The Free Joy State][/b]

The Issue
The nation's strict immigration standards prevent foreigners from becoming citizens without proper education in the nation's culture and history. However, a recent study shows that many natural-born @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ could not pass the same exam.

The Debate
1. "I don't see why we need to hold immigrants to a different standard than native citizens," says test administrator Charles Clean, looking up the weather on the day of the nation's founding for question 376. "We ought to treat everyone in @@NAME@@ the same and make them take the citizenship exam when they reach the age of majority. If they fail, they can be sent to whatever country their family originated from. If we can't find it, just send them to Bigtopia; I hear they could use some cheap labor."

2. "Just let everyone in," mumbles the laziest customs officer, Ingrid Jones, who is doing a crossword in the corner. "It's too much work — I mean, it's silly to hold them to a standard that isn't there. Just have them pass a basic background check to make sure they're hopefully not an Ultra-Violetist nutjob or serial jaywalker, then grant citizenship to them and their descendants. If it's good enough for @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, it should be good enough for everyone else."

3. "Don't listen to that idiot," counters nationalist speaker Michael Rabin, recently named 'Most Eloquent' in the Jingoists' Choice Awards. "If a person has @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ blood, then they're kin and we have a duty to protect their precious lives. The only immigrants we should allow in are those that can contribute, so they ought to take the tests on entry. And since the children of immigrants won't have @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ blood, they'll have to take the test too. Families should be proud if one of them passes and can live here."

4. "There's no need to address this so harshly," asserts high school teacher Sonequa Wonka, writing an incomprehensible pictorial equation on the wall. "If we increase funding on education, with a focus on civics, there won't be any more of these ignoramuses. Then the immigrants will have a fair standard to live up to. We could even offer free classes to would-be citizens to help them prepare for the test. A little education never hurt anyone."

The Issue
The surprise hit of the @@CAPITAL@@ Film Festival is [i]Kreator Kids[/i], a controversial documentary featuring Drew Shaffer's hardline evangelical homeschool curriculum — 'Curricula of Really Advanced Programmes' — which critics claim pushed racist, revisionist, sexist rhetoric and told children set theory was the work of the Devil. As you walk to your office building, the furore outside is almost as loud as the award buzz.

The Debate
1. "I don't want homeschooling to be associated with these irresponsible ideologues who brainwash their credulous kiddos!" huffs homeschooling mother @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, stopping you to shove a science text in your face, open at a page depicting a purple dinosaur doing a backstroke and titled [i]How the [u]Real[/u] Nessa Lake Creature Disproves Evilution[/i]. "Register us all centrally, vet us regularly and send all kids whose parents fail back to school. Test our children in all academic subjects, even critical thinking. People will soon see that many homeschoolers are competent."

2. "That 'documentary' is a liberal hatchet job!" Documentary participant Jiminy Jehoshaphat Rutter, a father of 13 children whose names all begin with a J, stomps up to you. "Parents know their unique progeny better than the state, or some 'filmmaker'. At home, I can teach my kids our religion without some Cyanist coming to serve rice with saffron and pomegranate and tell my babies about some 'Festivaqua' feast day! Uphold a parent's unrestricted right to homeschool; no nannying checks. Heck, if you value parental rights, you should also let us withdraw our munchkins from [i]any[/i] class we decide they don't need: religious education, biology, history, whatever."

3. "Dear Violet, no!" gasps @@RANDOM_NAME@@, the former educator of Mr. Rutter's triplets — Jinny, Jilly and Jenny — as @@HE@@ runs behind him. "Mr. Rutter's children must have rights, too: the right to an education that prepares them for [i]any[/i] life they'd choose. To protect children, all homeschooling must be banned. Money wasted weeding out the rotten apples could be spent on school improvements: smaller class sizes, more teachers, programmes for gifted students, support for struggling students and a deluxe detention hall where children are held in place with magnets... Or, just all the other stuff. Whatever."

4. You finally reach your office. The voice of Dilys Shaffer, mother of the curriculum author and a travelling traditional values speaker, drifts from a rally outside your window. "Deny this wisdom and deny the Truth! Total obedience is [i]always[/i] better and women [i]were[/i] built to meekly serve. I call to @@LEADER@@: seek not the depressive, worldly life of the overeducated. It leads only to blasphemy, introspection, raucous singing and shameless solicitation." She raises a graph that appears to show the number of solicitors. "Permit only pure, home-based education; fathers shall teach sons practical manly skills, and girls will learn quiet domestic arts from their mothers."

[b][anchor=1362]#1362[/anchor]: The Trans Panic Button [Ransium; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
A man picked up a transgender woman at a bar and brought her home, where he subsequently murdered her, beating her to death. In the ensuing court case, his lawyer argued a "trans panic" defense: the shock of realizing he had inadvertently picked up a trans woman sent his client temporarily criminally insane, rendering him irresponsible for his actions. The jury agreed, acquitting him of all charges.

The Debate
1. "This is an outrage!" cries the prosecuting attorney @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while slamming the court records on your desk and then writing 'OUTRAGE' in big letters with a red sharpie on the first page. "We cannot let defense lawyers play to the prejudices of the juries. Would we tolerate this if it was suggested someone went insane because they picked up a Bigtopian woman? Outlaw the practice of defense lawyers using sexuality and gender identity of the victim as mitigating factors."

2. Defense attorney @@RANDOM_NAME@@ storms into your office and silently mimes yelling while wildly gesticulating; finally, @@HE@@ actually speaks. "Sorry about that, but you were thinking of taking away my ability to speak freely while defending my clients. My client was already suffering from depression and a thyroid problem and the transgender nature of the victim provides critical context to the defendant's mental state at the time of the murder. What sort of pertinent information will you outlaw defense attorneys from presenting next? In the end you have to trust juries to decide what's a legitimate defense argument and what's not."

3. "@@HE@@ kind of has a point," notes LGBT activist @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while affixing a sticker of a rainbow-colored @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ flag to your desk. "The problem is that there's so much latent bias among @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ that juries fall for this tripe. Ultimately the responsibility for changing things falls on @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ leaders, which last I checked includes you. Increase LGBT representation in your cabinet and government, sign more laws preventing LGBT discrimination and mandating LGBT hiring, and promote more anti-hate crime legislation. Do what needs to be done to change @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ hearts and minds."

[b][anchor=1363]#1363[/anchor]: In My Defence [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Candlewhisper Archive][/b]

The Issue
After a flashbang grenade was thrown through his bedroom window and his front door was smashed open, National Rocket-launcher Association member Karl Rolfe reached for his legally-owned semi-automatic shotgun, intending to defend his home, and shot the first intruder he saw breaking into his house. Unfortunately for him, the intruder was a police officer, actioning a no-knock warrant at the head of a SWAT team. Later, it was found that the warrant was issued on bad information, based on a fabricated set of terrorism allegations by a vindictive ex-lover.

The Debate
1. "They called me a cop-killer!" weeps Rolfe, now sporting a black eye, a broken arm and multiple taser burns. "I'm a law-abiding citizen! I love the police; they're the good guys! I swear, that's what I've always believed. The problem is these no-knock warrants being issued too easily — I blame the lack of safeguards, not these fine upstanding officers who are victims as much as I am! A system that requires a higher standard of evidence before issuing no-knock warrants, that's what we need. Oh gods, please don't send me back to that cell... Please."

2. "Look, no-knock warrants are broadly useful tools of enforcement," rebuts police officer Preeti Freedom, lovingly stroking the butt of her rifle. "They actually reduce the risk of violence because we can normally act before perps get a chance to prepare any defence. Besides, we shouted 'POLICE!' just before we kicked his door in. Not our fault if he was disorientated at the time. I reckon he knew he was shooting a cop, and should be prosecuted for it."

3. "I never expected anyone to get shot," pouts the ex who made the false allegations, wearing an expression of hurt innocence. "I just wanted Karl to have a shock in the middle of the night, like I did that time he staggered home at 2 am and threw up on my pillow. For that, he deserved a rude awakening of his own! I think maybe people should be allowed to have guns, but should only be allowed to use them for their jobs or in the firing range. Idiotic use of firearms for so-called self-defence is just macho posturing, and someone always gets hurt with macho posturing. Get rid of the home defence laws!"

4. "People don't kill people, guns do!" wails weeping liberal Yoshi Ford, oblivious to the fact that his histrionically-waving arms have just knocked one of your aides out of a third-floor window. "Not only should private citizens not have guns, but the police shouldn't have guns either! In fact, I'm not even sure soldiers should carry guns! Guns are horrible things and are the real bad guys here! Ban them all!"

The Issue
Payday loan outlets provide quick loans to financially challenged individuals, but at interest rates far above what banks and other lenders charge. They have become the latest target of itinerant anti-poverty activists.

The Debate
1. "These payday loan and cheque cashing places are nothing more than money-hungry parasites preying on the weak and vulnerable!" declares placard-hoisting campaigner @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "By charging ridiculous levels of compound interest, they put their users deeper and deeper into debt! You must intervene and govern the entire loan business: set maximum interest rates, lessen fees charged for their services, and impose heavy fines on violators!"

2. "It's none of the government's business what I charge in terms of interest rates and fees; this is supposed to be a free market, is it not?" bemoans payday loan magnate Cashius Chekov. "I provide an invaluable service to people who need quick funds, for important things like leaky roofs, bicycle accidents, Eckie-Ecola sales... important things. Charging 40% interest isn't exorbitant; you can tell by the lines of happy clients who visit us every day! Stay out of our business, and we'll stay out of yours."

3. "Payday loan and cheque cashing institutions are notorious for money laundering and other dubious activities," scowls Chief Detective @@RANDOM_NAME@@ of the @@CAPITAL@@ Police Department. "Do you know how many phony cheques are cashed, or criminal activities are facilitated through the North-Northwestern Union money transfer service? If you want to help stymie crime, just shut down the entire industry. People can use banks, which have much more stringent security procedures."

[b][anchor=1365]#1365[/anchor]: Balancing the Box [Nuremgard; ed: Electrum][/b]

The Issue
A number of people have been imprisoned for failing to pay the license fee that funds the public @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ Broadcasting Corporation. The subject has sparked passionate debate in the media and on breakfast shows.

The Debate
*1. "An impartial and well-funded public broadcaster is essential to a democratic society," says highly paid  @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE_INITIALS@@BC presenter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while @@HE@@ sips a fifty percent coconut milk decaf venti latte, no sugar and extra cream. "Most hardworking, decent people value and recognise the work we do. They get so many different services for their fees such as television channels, radio programmes, my expense acco - I mean, educational documentaries. I say toughen enforcement of the license fee with a fleet of television detector vans to catch fee evaders and send them straight to jail." [[color=blue]Must have automobiles[/color]]

*2. "An impartial and well-funded public broadcaster is essential to a democratic society," says highly paid @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE_INITIALS@@BC presenter @@RANDOM_NAME@@, while @@HE@@ sips a fifty percent coconut milk decaf venti latte, no sugar and extra cream. "Most hardworking, decent people value and recognise the work we do.

I say toughen enforcement of the license fee with a fleet of television detector bicycles to catch fee evaders and send them straight to jail." [[color=red]Must not have automobiles[/color]]

3. "You could decriminalise license fee evasion," suggests judge @@RANDOM_NAME@@, whose workload is evenly split between murder and license fee trials. "The national broadcaster provides a good service but it doesn't seem fair to give people a criminal record for something so trivial. Also, it discriminates against poor people who can't afford the license fee. If the fees were dealt with as a civil matter, like when people fail to pay their energy bills, debt collectors would be able to seize property to pay the debt."

4. "Why don't we fund the  @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE_INITIALS@@BC out of general taxation instead?" yawns an under-depreciated junior Treasury minister, who is finding this funding discussion rather taxing. "That way, the broadcaster gets the money it needs, no one has to pay an expensive license fee and no one goes to prison or have their property seized. Everyone's going to benefit, well, except for the taxpayers, but it's accrual world after all. Anyways, I'd really appreciate it if you'd let me defer my role in this discussion. Calc-you-later."

5. "A license fee to watch TV? Public funding? What are we, East Lebatuckese?" questions billionaire media mogul RuPaul Murmarina, the owner of @@ANIMAL@@ News. "Forcing people to pay an archaic institution for supposedly impartial news and educational content is nonsense. I say privatise the broadcaster and let the free market do what it does best: meet the needs of the people by telling them what to think."

[b][anchor=1366]#1366[/anchor]: Parklife [Pythaga; ed: Gnejs][/b]

The Issue
Public parks all across @@NAME@@ are in shambles, with sports fields overgrown and playgrounds rusting themselves to pieces, all due to a lack of sufficient funding. While the upper-crust of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ society have taken to funding and operating their own parks on private property, large segments of urban populations have been left recreationally disenfranchised. A plethora of interested parties are demanding that you take a swing at the problem.

The Debate
1. "This clearly shows that private enterprise is much better at running parks than your government," boasts wealthy gut lord @@RANDOM_NAME@@, parked in your chair with @@HIS@@ feet on your table. "How about you put all of the public parks up for auction? Then they'll finally be competently managed, complete with well-maintained grounds and top-tier facilities. It would provide the public with a sense of enormous well-being, for what the free market deems a fair price."

2. "But think of the disadvantaged children!" bemoans annoyingly noble single parent @@RANDOM_NAME@@. "If all parks are made private, those heinous entry fees would mean I couldn't even afford to get in! It simply isn't fair that so many youngsters can't safely run around outside, so instead you must use government funds to restore our public recreational spaces. That way every child has an equal playing field, and then we'd be happy for the rest of our days, safe in the knowledge there will always be a bit of @@NAME@@ devoted to us."

3. "But that alone is not enough!" shouts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your neighbourhood dustman and part-time socialist, while waving a 'Parks for the Proletariat' poster in your face. "Public space is scarce, and you cannot continue to allow the upper-class to eat from their gold-plated picnic tables in their gated gardens. Take the lands those posh parks inhabit, and make them free to enjoy for all the people. From the hands of the rich, to walking hand-in-hand. That is the proper parklife."

The Issue
Recent studies show childhood obesity is on the rise, and many believe this to be the fault of attention-grabbing packaging on sugary foods.

The Debate
1. "How are we supposed to keep our children healthy when all of their favorite cartoon characters are shown brazenly endorsing these products?" screams angry mother Michelle Cash. "Children who can't readily distinguish reality from fiction are tricked into thinking they need these products to be like their heroes! We mothers demand that packaging should never be designed to influence the minds of children! We demand plain and informative packaging!"

2. "Come now, surely people can be trusted to make their own decisions?" purrs fat-cat CEO Anthony Tyger. "Besides, you could argue that being exposed to advertising at an early age trains young people to be discerning consumers. It's a form of real-life education. Trust instead in industry self-regulation, and keep government out of it. That'd be gr-r-reat!"

3. "I think the fact that this is an issue in the first place speaks volumes about the way we see larger people!" cries your morbidly obese Minister of Compassion, weeping as she munches on a bowl of frosted Happios cereal. "Why can't we allow people to be whatever shape they are without ostracism? Let bigger kids be bigger kids, and if anyone criticizes their weight, that should be deemed illegal hate speech!"

The Issue
The new director of the @@CAPITAL@@ Department of Transportation has suggested that imposing dynamic parking prices might help ease the city centre's nightmarish congestion. Because the national government owns large parts of the capital, the plan cannot proceed without your approval.

The Debate
1. Director @@RANDOM_NAME@@, who was formerly a professor of urban planning, pushes up his glasses. "Dynamic parking prices will mean that not only will drivers have to pay for parking, but that the prices will change throughout the day based on the location's demand. For example, drivers will pay more to park during busy periods. This will encourage motorists to park in quieter areas and not hog the same spot for hours on end. Take notes, there will be a quiz next week— er, sorry, force of habit there."

2. "This isn't a game of Maxopoly where the 'free parking' space gives a windfall of revenue!" complains the Minister of Labor, who's just come from a marathon six-hour session of said game. "This plan will punish the working poor who can ill afford parking fees. If the city wants to deal with congestion, then it should start building more underground tunnels and parking garages with your help. Free parking is the right of every citizen, and you can't start charging me — I mean, the miserably poor — for parking."

3. "This plan is too complicated," says the laconic Minister of Gordian Knots, who arrived in an ox cart and is now snipping at the air with a pair of scissors. "But doing nothing is not an option. Let us ban cars from the city instead. Stops congestion. Keeps things simple."

The Issue
For the past few months, your administration has been working on a landmark trade deal with the historically hostile nation of Blackacre. On the eve of the agreement's planned signing, Georgia Mormont — a high-ranking official from the Blackacrean government — has approached you with the intent to defect.

The Debate
1. "If we upset the Blackacreans, months of planning could go to waste!" whispers your suspicious Minister of Pragmatism as she glares at the visibly trembling Blackacrean advisor. "Blackacre would never allow their Chief of Staff to defect! We have to turn her away and report this to Blackacre. It may be cold, but I stand — I mean, [i]we[/i] stand to make a lot from this trade deal. This agreement could be the path to a long-lasting peace between our two nations — don't let a single defector stand in our way."

2. "@@LEADER@@, please don't abandon me!" quietly pleads Mormont, as she pulls you into a secluded corner of the room. "I'm almost absolutely sure that they've discovered my intentions to defect by now. If you don't protect me, the secret police will be sure to 'disappear' me. Let me stay and I will give you valuable information that you could use against Blackacre. Trade deals might be valuable, but trust me, the secrets I know are worth so much more. Want to know where their secret nuclear missile launch sites are? Yes, I thought you would..."

3. "I agree that they'd never let her defect," comments your shady Intelligence Minister, as he escorts you out of the room. "Which is why I'm surprised she's here — the Blackacrean Supreme Leader keeps close watch on all of her subordinates. She must have been sent here to spy on us, but that's fine. We'll feed her dirty intel, track her communications, and who knows? We could find ourselves a spy network, right here in @@NAME@@. I'm sure you'll agree this is the best course of action, hmm?"

The Issue
After several avoidable deaths were blamed on the incompetent medical advice of "@@RANDOM_NAME@@ MD", an individual operating from a shady office on the outskirts of @@CAPITAL@@, investigation revealed that @@HE@@ was using the letters MD without possessing a medical license, nor indeed any form of qualification.

The Debate
1. "I never lied to anybody!" wheedles the accused individual over the phone, from the bunker where @@HE@@ has gone into hiding. "I never said I was a Medical Doctor, and I didn't post any signs calling my office a clinic. In fact, obviously, the initials stand for Managing Director. I merely gave advice to whomever happened to come by, and they paid me for my wisdom! Is it a crime to be wrong? Whatever happened to free speech?"

2. "My diagnosis: misuse of post-nominal letters. The prescription: board certification!" pontificates Doctor @@RANDOM_NAME@@, president of the @@NAME@@ Medical Association, while scribbling illegibly in a notepad. "There are professional associations for nearly all reputable occupations: MDs, CPAs, even the lawyers with their cute little 'Esq.' title! You must require that an individual be certified by a proper professional association before using any kind of letters after their name, for the public's sake."

3. "I agree that we need credentialing, but the government ought to handle it," opines A@@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Deputy Minister for Expanding Bureaucracy. "Can we really trust private groups to handle membership fairly? That's just begging for corruption and nepotism. We'll set standards that will be the same all across @@NAME@@, and the paper trail we create — signed in triplicate and filed appropriately — will ensure we know exactly who is allowed to call themselves what!"

4. "Occupational titles?" asks your protocol assistant, straightening his cravat. "Oh no, what the government needs is some new titles of its own, to recognize citizens that have served us well! Imagine — the @@LEADER@@ Medal of Freedom! The @@NAME@@ Legion of Merit! Maybe even bring back knighthoods and earldoms and duchies? That's how you show some appreciation! Those are the only post-nominals that should be allowed, and the only ones that matter!"

"Any psychotic Pizza Cultist can go down to City Hall and get all of my personal information with no repercussions!

Traditionally, clubs in the Football League have been sponsored by such entities as Cheesemongers Unlimited, Chairs 'n' Stuff, and Sharp 'n' Pointy Things Incorporated. Recently, however, many big-name clubs have struck deals with corporations representing such seedy nations as Althaniq, Blackacre, and the United Federation.

The Debate
1. "Hey hey, ho ho, Althaniq has got to go!" shout the ultra fans of @@CAPITAL@@ United, a club that is now under Althaniq's ownership. Their leader, @@RANDOM_NAME@@, continues through a megaphone: "We are all ordinary football fans and we deserve to have a voice in how our club runs!

For the fairness and equity of our sport, we implore you to enact a policy that allows us fans to own the majority of our club's shares and voting rights!"

The Issue
For once, a government program has been a hit, with the new YourGov app giving citizens unified access to all their important government services. But some @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@, concerned with the storage of their personal data on government servers, have decompiled the app. These privacy advocates have discovered that large portions of the code rely on restrictive "copyleft" software libraries written in the United Federation.

The Debate
1. "I created those libraries for the good of the world, and you selfish @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ jerks used them without following the terms!" yells Ganondorf Ungar, sniffling his nose as he tries to wipe boogers on your table surreptitiously. "It says right here in the software license: all derivative works must be released under the same open-source license, so you're committing a copyright violation by not giving out your code! Release your code and comply with the license, then maybe, just maybe, I won't take your government to some international court and sue for everything you've got!"

2. "Whoa, now hold on there," interjects lead YourGov developer Lucina Claus, who likes to go with the integer overflow. "Yeah... okay, we might possibly have used, ah, just a couple of those libraries that the kid wrote. But for us to comply with this "Wildebeest" license he's talking about, we would have to make our code open source! Imagine the security risk if Dàguó hackers were able to access our systems by using the publicly available source code! It's unreasonable to expect us to comply with these terms — you need to exempt the government from overreaching copyleft licenses in the name of security!"

3. "The problem here isn't the license or the code, it's that people found out!" whispers a shady looking individual, the brim of whose black hat is tilted to obscure his face. "@@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ who decompile the code are a security risk themselves — just like any malicious hacker. We need to obfuscate all of the code, only allow trusted developers access, and forbid members of the public from tinkering with it.

4. "Pretty sure that's an unconscionable breach of our civil rights," responds Sancho Jones, who found the copied code, as he desperately tries to conceal a Guy Fawkes mask. "We have a right to know what we're installing on our computers — any software that you want us to download should always be open source, including the ones that you code in house!

The Issue
A high-speed police pursuit ended in disaster last night when the suspect suddenly lost control of her vehicle and swerved into incoming traffic, triggering a fatal pileup. The deadly chase has raised questions regarding whether pursuits on the nation's roadways are worth the danger they present to the public.

The Debate
1. "Let's cut to the chase," suggests roadway safety official Bella Swallows. "Evidence shows that police pursuits present an unacceptable risk to the general public and drive @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ into their graves! A national no-pursuit policy should be adopted, with reasonable exceptions when authorized by a senior police officer. After all, there's no point in running down the guilty if the innocent are collateral damage."

2. "If cops can't tail thugs then why even have police cars?" oinks the rotund @@CAPITAL@@ Police Chief, channeling her frustration into your desk with a truncheon. "Besides, you'd be letting lawbreaking lowlifes escape! LEOs should instead be extensively trained in PIT, TPAC, and TVI against GTAs, TWOC, and perps DUI, to prevent IRTCs and RTAs. If criminals know escape is impossible, then maybe they won't run to begin with. Do it ASAP!"

3. "Nobody can escape a traffic jam!" declares the Interim Director of Infrastructure, Oversight, and Traffic at the Transportation Ministry. "Roadway congestion near vehicle pursuits can be easily created and manipulated by altering traffic lights or closing roads, ensnaring evasive goons in bumper-to-bumper backups, which all but guarantees quick apprehension by police. Motorists might not appreciate being made into unwitting roadblocks, but why care? If you ask me, the only thing more despicable than a bottleneck is a criminal!"

[b][anchor=1375]#1375[/anchor]: Never Say Yes to a Conference Again [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Issue
Once again, the cruel hand of obligation has dragged you to the G20,000 Summit, an annual gathering of nations great and small. You are currently stuck in the evening social mixer, where one wrong word to a rival nation's representatives can quickly escalate to hostilities. Unfortunately, several dignitaries appear keen on talking to you.

The Debate
*1. "There you are! We haven't spoken in ages," enthuses Chancellor Kurt Zahmahkibo of Smalltopia. "I hate to ask for your help, but I have a bit of a conundrum. I'm sure you have heard that East Lebatuck, our largest neighbor, has become rather menacing and hostile recently. Their military has been conducting frequent 'training exercises' right next to the border. The next thing you know, they'll be storming our cities with their tanks! To be blunt, we need protection from these communist warmongers. Would it be possible to station some of your nuclear weapons in our country?" [[color=blue]Must be Capitalist[/color]]

*2. "There you are! We haven't spoken in ages," enthuses "Doc" Moreno, the President for Life of the socialist island nation of San Vitenzo. "I hate to ask for your help, but I have a bit of a conundrum. I'm sure you have heard that the United Federation, our closest neighbor, has become rather menacing and hostile recently. Their navy has been conducting frequent 'training exercises' in our own territorial waters. The next thing you know, they'll be landing on our shores with their tanks! To be blunt, we need protection from these fascist pigs. Would it be possible to station some of your nuclear weapons in our country?" [[color=red]Must be Socialist[/color]]

**3. Before you can respond, you hear a shout from the nearby bar. "Hey, it's the Head Honcho of @@NAME@@! How's it going?" exclaims Smalltopia's Air Chief Marshall Diego Fufu, who seems to see this sort of gathering as an excuse to get uproariously drunk. "Did the Boss Man tell you about our proposal to borrow some of your nukes? You know, if you really wanted to protect us, why don't you just give us the launch codes after sending over your missiles? That way, we'd both be able to unleash destruction upon anyone who threatened us... including those vulgar Maxtopians." [[color=blue]Must be Capitalist[/color]]

**4. Before you can respond, you hear a shout from the nearby bar. "Hey, it's the Head Honcho of @@NAME@@! How's it going?" exclaims San Vitenzo's Air Chief Marshall @@RANDOM_FIRST_NAME@@ Fufu, who seems to see this sort of gathering as an excuse to get uproariously drunk. "Did the Boss Man tell you about our proposal to borrow some of your nukes? You know, if you really wanted to protect us, why don't you just give us the launch codes after sending over your missiles? That way, we'd both be able to unleash destruction upon anyone who threatened us... including those vulgar Maxtopians." [[color=red]Must be Socialist[/color]]

***5. "Yeah... we're not giving out our nuclear launch codes," declares your Defense Minister, Mack Rimera, who has been glaring at the Merovingian delegation with a look of disgust. "However, Chancellor Zahmahkibo has a point. The commie parasites need to be kept in check. Tell Smalltopia that we will agree to their request, but only if we can set up a military base on their land — and doing it correctly is going to require a lot of tax @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@." [[color=blue]Must be Capitalist[/color]]

***6. "Yeah... we're not giving out our nuclear launch codes," declares your Defense Minister, Rolan Malinovich, who has been glaring at the Merovingian delegation with a look of disgust. "However, President Moreno has a point. The imperialist parasites need to be kept in check. Tell San Vitenzo that we will agree to their request, but only if we can set up a military base on their land — and doing it correctly is going to require a lot of tax @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@." [[color=red]Must be Socialist[/color]]

****7. "Seriously? You still have weapons of mass destruction?" calls Prime Minister Anders Anderson of Skandilund, who was eavesdropping from a nearby table. "I strongly urge you to dismantle them. I know they make you feel powerful and can lead to a variety of entertaining dilemmas, but the world would be so much safer without them. And more boring, but I suppose some people like that." [[color=blue]Must be Capitalist[/color]]

[b][anchor=1376]#1376[/anchor]: From East Lebatuck With Love [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
A few months have passed since the G20,000 Summit, where you agreed to station some of your nuclear weapons in Smalltopia to aid in their defense against the forces of communism.

The Issue
Today was supposed to be a calm day. The issues on your desk this morning were even more trivial than usual. Of course, that's how it always goes. Your Minister of Intelligence, known only as 'N', suddenly bursts into your office with an armful of surveillance photos. "@@LEADER@@, we've discovered an urgent problem. The nearby island nation of San Vitenzo — a backward, communist hellhole — has suddenly become a buzzing hive of activity. East Lebatuck has covertly brought a shipment of nuclear missiles to the island and is setting them up as we speak. Yes, we put some of our own missiles in Smalltopia — but we're the good guys! They have no right to threaten us! I'm sending in secret agent James Bont to deal with the situation. Of course, we will need to attack this problem on all fronts, so I have invited our colleagues from some of the... less interesting government ministries to discuss a few additional options."

The Debate
1. Without any hesitation, Defense Minister Mack Rimera marches into your office and drops a stack of reports into your lap. "We can't afford to let East Lebatuck put our citizens in mortal danger! Those commies only respect power and violence. If we send our warships to blockade San Vitenzo, this will allow us to project a show of force, while also preventing additional shipments of missiles or enemy troops from reaching the island. Do you agree?"

2. "Perhaps a calmer reply would produce better results," suggests Minister of International Diplomacy Maureen Dusk, who walks in with the acoustic guitar that she is infamous for carrying around at all times. "The missiles are definitely a threat, but they're not yet capable of firing them from San Vitenzo. We have a limited window of opportunity to solve things peacefully. What if we suggested some sort of diplomatic summit between our three nations? It couldn't hurt to ask."

--------------------------------------------------------------
[b][anchor=1377]#1377[/anchor]: For @@LEADER@@'s Ears Only [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
Secret agent James Bont has been sent to San Vitenzo with orders to infiltrate the missile installation sites.

The Issue
As you are heading toward yet another meeting, you receive a phone call from N, your Minister of Intelligence, who has news from James Bont and needs to speak with you about his mission.

The Debate
1. "Good morning, boss," proclaims the steady voice of your spy chief. "Bont reported that he was able to steal a missile technician's uniform and security badge that may allow him to enter the enemy bases undetected. However, there's been a small... complication. We believe that one or more enemy agents are aware of his presence. They're probably too dangerous to ignore. Do you want to give Bont a free hand to neutralize the threat? A few bullets should take care of... wait, did you hear that clicking sound? I hope this phone isn't bugged. Code Blue, @@LEADER@@." N hangs up, leaving you bewildered.

2. After staring at your phone for a few seconds, you feel your right shoe vibrating as blue text starts scrolling across the toe: "Alternatively, if you're uncomfortable with extrajudicial killings, you could order Bont to capture any enemy spies and hand them off to us for interrogation. It's riskier than just shooting them — our enemies may have set up a trap that could result in Bont's death — but we might be able to gain valuable intel or use prisoners as a negotiating tool."

3. While still thinking it over, you're suddenly interrupted by cooing coming from an open window. A carrier pigeon alights on your shoulder and presents a small note tied to its right leg: "There's a third way of dealing with this. If you want, you could instruct Bont to simply ignore the enemy agents and focus on his primary mission. This might just be a diversion to waste our time and allow East Lebatuck to finish installing their missiles. Well, let me know of your decision by this evening. PS: This message will self-destruct in ten seconds."

* These options also appear as 3, 4, 5 according to internal numbering. They appear to be the same wording as the internally numbered options 0, 1, and 2 as stated above. [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=38016221#p38016221]Source.[/url]

[b][anchor=1378]#1378[/anchor]: Authorization to Kill [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
The navy has been sent to blockade the nearby island of San Vitenzo, where East Lebatuck has been installing nuclear missiles.

The Issue
San Vitenzo is currently surrounded by a mighty armada of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ naval vessels. However, convoys of ships from East Lebatuck are quickly approaching your blockade line and are threatening to open fire unless you let them through.

The Debate

*1. "We can't let the commies intimidate us!" declares Defense Minister Mack Rimera, who is pouring something from a flask into his morning coffee. "If they think we're weak, they'll just continue trying to take advantage of us at every opportunity. Have our flagship fire a warning shot across their bows and order East Lebatuck's ships to turn around. If the enemy doesn't comply, open fire and unleash hell." [[color=purple]Must have a Leader[/color]]

*2. "We can't let the commies intimidate us!" declares Defense Minister Mack Rimera, who is pouring something from a flask into his morning coffee.

Have our flagship fire a warning shot across their bows and order East Lebatuck's ships to turn around. If the enemy doesn't comply, open fire and unleash hell." [[color=purple]Must not have a Leader[/color]]

**3. "No! That could escalate to war — and it would all be our fault!" shouts Maureen Dusk, who had been plucking a few notes of 'Born in @@NAME@@' on her guitar. "Keep the blockade in place and demand that the enemy stay back, but order our navy to take no action unless they're directly attacked. Stopping East Lebatuck's cargo shipments isn't worth our sailors' lives." [TBD]

*4. "We can't let the commies intimidate us!" declares Defense Minister Mack Rimera, who is pouring something from a flask into his morning coffee. "If they think we're weak, they'll just continue trying to take advantage of us at every opportunity.

[b][anchor=1379]#1379[/anchor]: A View to a Thrill [Pogaria; ed: Pogaria] [Issue Series: MADness][/b]

The Story So Far
East Lebatuck's convoy confronted your naval blockade of San Vitenzo.

The Issue
The enemy ships have turned back, in compliance with your demands. However, your surveillance of the island now shows that the nuclear missiles that were already on San Vitenzo are almost ready for deployment.

The Debate
1. "They were just using the standoff as a delaying tactic!" yells Defense Minister Mack Rimera, throwing his notes across the room in a barely restrained fury. "While we were pointing our guns at each other, East Lebatuck was biding its time until their doomsday weapons were ready. We only have a few days before they are able to launch. It's imperative that we send our air force to bomb the missile sites — and we must do it now!"

2. "Don't forget that we still have James Bont over there," reminds Intelligence Minister N, who had been whispering to a young woman in the corner. "My assistant, Ms. Evelyn Cashcent, tells me that Agent Bont has made significant progress at infiltrating the enemy bases. There's a good chance that he will be able to sabotage the missile launch equipment, if those are your orders. The only downside is that we don't know how long this might take."

3. "It's still not too late for negotiations," claims Minister of International Diplomacy Maureen Dusk, playing an anguished version of the '@@ANIMAL@@ Blues' on her guitar. "If there's any possibility of a non-violent solution, we have to pursue it. However, if we're going to have some sort of diplomatic summit to work out our differences, this is almost certainly our last opportunity. If we let it slip away... things could get rather grim."
