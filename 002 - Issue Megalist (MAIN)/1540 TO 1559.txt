[b][anchor=1540]#1540[/anchor]: Clean Flavours [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Frieden-und Freudenland and Candensia][/b]

The Issue
Over the weekend, two dozen people were admitted to the hospital after ingesting the new liquid detergent Wonderoso, having mistaken it for a soft drink.

The Debate
1, "It's irresponsible to package detergent in the same way as soft drinks," observes Dr. @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a toxicologist. "It's not just the liquids either. There's brightly coloured detergent tablets that kids mistake for sweets, and manufacturers apply scents like cinnamon, mint and vanilla to toxic products. Cleaning products should be hard to open, look unappetising and be clearly noxious in appearance!" @@HE@@ pauses to take a swig from @@HIS@@ soft drink, and suddenly stiffens and keels over like a falling log.

2, "Our prime responsibility is to our shareholders, and that means maximising sales with consumer-preferred features and packaging," explains a corporate marketing spokesperson, who is dressed in a lab coat to give the impression of being a scientist. "It's not our duty nor the government's duty to protect people from their own stupidity, like somehow mistaking licorice-flavoured brown oxy-power fizzy Wonderoso for Eckie-Ecola. Our all-purpose cleansers are not intended for ingestion despite — allegedly — tasting twice as good as the leading alternative."

3, "The problem is not that detergents look like foods, it's that food looks like detergents," complains organic farmer @@RANDOM_NAME@@, waving a misshapen turnip at you. "We should ban food colourings and any food additives that are designed to change the appearance of edibles. Once people get used to natural-looking produce, there'll be no chance of them mistaking a pastel-coloured soap product for food."

The Issue
Attending a passing out ceremony this morning, a stand-off ensues when two officers of different ranks in the nation's sprawling military bureaucracy both insist the other salutes first. Twenty minutes of awkward posturing later, an aide suggests it might be time you intervened.

The Debate
1. "This is absolutely ridiculous!" exclaims Field Commander Four-and-a-Half Star Lieutenant-Colonel with fig leaf cluster Boyson Longfellow, arms held stiffly at his side as he stares down Grand Marshal Brigadier-Major first class Grace Shatner. "We officers should be afforded the respect our proud service warrants, through a plethora of ranks to tailor to every officer's skill set and service to the army, and it's every soldier's duty to understand their place in the hierarchy."

2. "Why should I be forced to remember every single rank?" pipes up pallid-faced orderly Luciano Beachcroft. "I got ten days of latrine scrubbing for not being able to distinguish between 162 varieties of epaulettes — how ridiculous is that? Military ranks must be made simpler if you want efficient battlefield decisions rather than generals squabbling like children." He looks mournfully at a worn toothbrush as both the Field Commander and Grand Marshal turn to glower at him.

[b][anchor=1542]#1542[/anchor]: Dangerous Liaisons [Baggieland; ed: Frieden-und Freudenland][/b]

The Issue
Your brother just broke up with his most recent girlfriend. However, this one turned out to be a bit different from all his previous love interests.

The Debate
*1. "You've got to help me; she's a psycho! Did you know she tried to put my beloved bunny Fluffykins in a pot and boil her alive?" exclaims your brother, as he nervously pulls the curtain to check if she's lurking outside. "I tried to break up with her nicely, as I always do, but she won't take 'no' for an answer. Look at this — 426 unread messages already today — and it's only 2pm! You've got to make stalking a serious offence punishable by jail time and send this clingy hysterical woman to prison! Then, I'll be free to ask out that cashier at the local supermarket; she's a real cutie!" [Validity TBD]

*2. "You've got to help me; she's a psycho! Did you know she tried to put my beloved bunny Fluffykins in a pot and boil her alive?" exclaims your brother, as he nervously pulls the curtain to check if she's lurking outside. "I tried to break up with her nicely, as I always do, but she won't take 'no' for an answer. Look at this — 426 unread messages already today — and it's only 2pm! You've got to make stalking a serious offence punishable by jail time and send this clingy hysterical woman to prison! Then, I'll be free to ask out that cashier at the local supermarket; she's a real cutie!" [Validity TBD]

3. "Although I agree with your brother's diagnoses, I disagree with his method of rehabilitation," states @@RANDOM_NAME@@, a psychiatrist, as @@HE@@ beckons your brother to a leather couch. "Serial stalkers are known to have mental disorders that increase their infatuation with the object of their desire, leading to irrational and anti-social behaviour. Prison time will not cure them. What they need is an extensive course of cognitive behavioural therapy, where they will learn to decode, process, and alter their warped thinking patterns."

4. "But he promised to be with me forever! I don't want anyone else — he's the one for me," wails your brother's ex, appearing from behind the couch and giving him a vacant stare. Then she turns to you and smiles sweetly. "You should make it law that anyone who has been ditched has the right to watch over their ex constantly for the next six months. Just to make sure they're okay and that they're sure they made the right decision." She turns again to your brother. "By the way, I know you're seeing that girl at the supermarket. STAY AWAY FROM HER OR I'LL BE USING HER INTESTINES AS FISH BAIT!"

[b][anchor=1544]#1544[/anchor]: Happy Juice [Candlewhisper Archive; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
Concentrated grape juice bricks are being sold with the helpful warning: "Do not place this brick in a sterilized one gallon crock, add sugar, water, and yeast, and let stand covered in a warm location for seven days prior to bottling, or else an illegal alcoholic beverage will result."

The Debate
1. "They're makin' a mockery of ush, a mock-a-reee!" slurs your brother, taking a swig from a nondescript brown glass bottle. "Thes...sh... thesesh companiesh need to reshpect your autho...aurhoritah! Shilly word games changes...esh nothing! Punish them! Punn... issh... ish..." He falls asleep with an accusatory index finger still pointed in the air.

2. "We are absolutely devoted to sobriety!" protests the CEO of Temperance Grapes, the manufacturer of the offending product. "We are merely offering advice to help maintain legal compliance. Tell your regulators to stick to enforcing the letter of the law, instead of inventing problems where none exist! Which reminds me, we need to add a warning to the packs of baker's yeast we sell as well..."

The Issue
Many years ago during a skirmish between Dàguó and the United Federation, the [i]UFS Fricking Awesome[/i] was sunk off the coast of @@NAME@@ with many lives lost. A United Federation businessman recently dived on the site to place a wreath, but discovered that the ship was completely gone, a casualty of @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ metal salvagers.

The Debate
1. "That was a war grave!" declares Randy Cox III, the UF businessman, as his scuba gear drips water all over your office. "A local fisherman told me that the bones of the sailors who died on that ship were just dumped on a landfill. This is outright sacrilege! Not only must these piratical bottom-feeders be arrested, but @@NAME@@ must do all it can to protect other war graves in its waters; you need around the clock patrols by the coastguard and warships, whatever it takes!"

2. "That ship belonged in a museum!" shouts fedora-wearing archaeologist Illinois Smith. "Those wrecks need to be excavated by qualified archaeologists, and everything there brought onshore and preserved in the National Maritime Museum. Only responsible professionals like me can be trusted to take due care with these precious historical artifacts!" He twitches slightly, hoping no-one will mention the time he swapped an ancient imperial corpse for a diamond, or used an arm bone as a torch, or endangered an 11-year-old he had employed as an impromptu local guide.

3. "Let's not get in the way of business, shall we?" pontificates Achenar Ponta, the owner of a maritime metal salvaging company. "These ships contain tons of low-background steel, and salvage operations provide jobs and considerable economic and scientific benefit. The [i]legal principle[/i] of [i]'inventores possessores, amittentes lamentantes'[/i] clearly applies here. As for any organic impurities entangled in the salvage, they most certainly do not end up in landfill: they're hygienically cremated during the scrap melting process. I say that any ship sunk in @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ waters is @@DEMONYM_ADJECTIVE@@ property, and so long as we pay our corporation taxes you should be encouraging our entrepreneurship."

4. "I say there aren't enough shipwrecks in our waters," ponders Debra Wickwire, the owner of another salvaging company, as she takes a swig from your coffee before you have a chance to grab the cup. "Maybe the government could look the other way while we place a sea mine or two on the busier coastal trade routes. Companies like mine can then just lurk nearby, and we can clean up!"

[b][anchor=1546]#1546[/anchor]: Fool's Gold [Electrum; ed: Verdant Haven][/b]

The Issue
When @@NAME@@ instituted the gold standard, it brought transparency and stability to the sometimes-fickle economy. The economy responded strongly — so strongly, in fact, that the government is finding it difficult to maintain sufficient gold reserves to finance its growing obligations, should they suddenly be called in.

The Debate
1. "If we need more gold, then let's go digging!" hollers Minister for Creative Solutions @@RANDOM_NAME@@, excitedly hefting a pickaxe. "There are viable gold deposits right under @@CAPITAL@@ and some other big population centers. If we loosen restrictions surrounding the use of sodium cyanide, and allow some of the other practices needed for extracting gold from low-grade ore, we'll be able to boost our reserves in a jiffy! Now that's an Au-some idea."

2. "There's no need to do all that work... the real problem is private ownership of gold!" argues @@RANDOM_NAME@@, Minister for 'Creative' Solutions. "If our people are holding on to gold, then we can't use it to back our currency. We need to abolish private ownership of gold, and compel people to turn it in for its fair market value! Of course, there is the teeny-tiny complication of people hiding their holdings from the government, so we'll also need to establish a new investigatory agency to look into potential cases of hoarding."

3. "We have an open economy — if we need more gold, we can trade for it!" observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your creative Minister for Solutions, known for @@HIS@@ connections to war zones across @@REGION@@. "Thing is, you don't just want to buy it using @@CURRENCY_PLURAL@@ — that'd be trading gold for gold. You need somebody willing to make a different sort of exchange. As it happens, I know some bloodthirsty rebels... err, I mean plucky freedom fighters, who would happily exchange some of their vast gold reserves for material support in the form of bombs and ammunition. Say the word and we'll turn lead into gold!"

4. "The challenge is that we have a closed economy" observes @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your creative Minister for Solutions, known for @@HIS@@ connections to war zones across @@REGION@@. "Our ability to finance our obligations will always be limited by our domestic stock of gold. If we open our borders to trade, I bet I can find somebody willing to send us gold for something we don't need as much. As a matter of fact, I know some bloodthirsty rebels... err, I mean plucky freedom fighters, who would happily exchange some of their vast gold reserves for material support in the form of bombs and ammunition. Just say the word and we'll turn lead into gold!"

5. "This policy experiment has been madness! Why are you trying to save it?" pleads Ruel Taylor, an overwrought employee of the Central Bank of @@NAME@@ taking a break from haranguing passers-by about something called 'Floating Rates.' "There is no way we can mine, seize, or import gold fast enough to meet the demands of our swelling economy. End the gold standard and allow our currency to fluctuate again on the open market, or we'll suffer an economic catastrophe that makes our current limitations look like a holiday!"

6. "This policy experiment has been madness! Why are you trying to save it?" pleads Ruel Taylor, an overwrought employee of the Central Bank of @@NAME@@, taking a break from haranguing passers-by about something called 'Currency Convertibility.' "There is no way we can mine, seize, or even import gold fast enough to meet the demands of our swelling economy. End the gold standard and return to issuing fiat currency, or we'll suffer an economic catastrophe that makes our current limitations look like a holiday!"

[b][anchor=1547]#1547[/anchor]: The Return of the Prodigal Son [Baggieland; ed: Zwangzug][/b]

The Issue
Some time ago, the government began abandoning children to raise themselves in the wild. Now, many of these feral children have come of age and are ready to rejoin society.

The Debate
1. "See what a success this policy has been!" boasts @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Education, who has had very little to do these past few years. "We've saved so much money on schools, child services, hospital admissions... The state of nature is much more efficient than our government. On top of that, the wolves — or bears, or whoever — raised these children well with a sound grasp of family responsibility and societal togetherness. To take the next step, let's put these free-range @@DEMONYM_PLURAL@@ into the menial jobs no one else wants. @@ANIMAL@@ see, @@ANIMAL@@ do!"

2. "MY BABIES!" wails @@RANDOM_FEMALE_NAME@@, a mother who had to give up her children to the wild. "My home has been so empty these past years; I just want my little cherubs back... NOW! I don't care what physical or emotional state they're in, or whether they've brushed their teeth in living memory. A mother's love is all they need to once again become valued, cherished members of society."

3. "You can't just reintroduce these creatures into society without any checks," declares @@RANDOM_NAME@@, your Minister of Social Services, keeping @@HIS@@ distance from a formerly wild child who has also been brought into your office. "There should be at least a year's reintegration period at an educational institution, where these people can catch up on their language skills, as well as learn about human societal norms. They need to be supervised very carefully and have support staff available for them at every stage of their journey, for their own safety as well as ours."

4. "Grrrrrr," snarls the young @@MAN/WOMAN@@ in your office. "Me like forest. No like city. Me back to forest. Stay there. Forever." @@HE/SHE@@ bounds out of your office on all fours, swinging from the chandelier as @@HE/SHE@@ goes.
